Incident 7442,Resolved,2021-02-15,NAME UNKNOWN,Minot State University,Faculty,,unknown,,Resigned,"""school failed to process a complaint by a then-student who reported a professor had sexually assaulted her for over two years.

The federal agency’s Office for Civil Rights announced the settlement Thursday. Under the terms of the agreement, the university has agreed to offer and pay for counseling and other remedies for the woman to address any psychological, academic or employment issues she faced as a result of the school’s delay in processing her complaint.

The university came under scrutiny after the woman, who was not identified, filed a complaint with the agency in December 2013 alleging the school had discriminated against her on the basis of sex. The agency summarized the findings of its investigation in a 38-page letter addressed to Steven Shirley, the university’s president.

The letter states that the student told the school about “numerous alleged instances of sexual harassment and sexual assault that began in June 2010 and continued through December 2012.” It also explains that the professor had implied to woman that without his assistance she “would be unable to achieve her professional goals.” The woman also said that the professor and others on his behalf had sent her text messages and emails “to discourage her from pursuing any complaint against him.”

The letter does not address whether the professor was investigated by authorities or criminally charged. The agency found no evidence that the university interviewed the professor, faculty or students about the student’s allegations. It also says that the university did not adjudicate the student’s allegation through hearing procedures, as required by the university’s policies. Instead, when the professor resigned in August 2013, the university halted its investigation.""",2016,https://apnews.com/article/7d1ea5bfbcf540e1aaef110dbc2b9cc6,

Incident 7528,Resolved,2022-11-17,Mohammed A. Malik,Roxbury Community College,Administrator,Dean,"Education, Academic Affairs",Academic Affairs,No Longer Employed (includes Fired and Contract Non-renewal),"""Six weeks after a top administrator left Roxbury Community College following accusations that he sexually harassed female employees there, he is still on the payroll drawing an annual salary of $74,385.

Staff members at the college have said that Mohammed A. Malik, the school's dean of academic affairs, has cleaned out his office and has not been at work since the second week of April, yet he continues to receive full pay. He has not officially resigned from his position, and the college's personnel office has received no formal word that he has been fired, according to college staff.

The Massachusetts Commission against Discrimination has said that it is investigating a charge of sexual harassment at the school. In March, The Boston Globe reported that three female staff members said they had been subjected to repeated harassment of a sexual nature by Malik in 1986 and 1987. The women said Malik had touched their bodies and repeatedly propositioned them. Less than two weeks later, college staff members said Malik has not been back to work.

Malik, 54, also reportedly was involved in sexual harassment at an out-of-state college where he worked in an administrative position before coming to Roxbury Community College two years ago.

Although no formal charges were filed at that college, a female staff member said in a telephone interview last week that she had worked previously for Malik and that he harassed her on more than one occasion.

She said that one time he grabbed and kissed her while she was in his office to discuss business. On another occasion he made lewd comments. She said he sometimes tried to entice her to take trips with him, promising to introduce her to people who would advance her career.

The woman requested that her name and the name of the college not be printed. A top administrator at the college, who is no longer employed there, said in a telephone interview that the matter was discussed at the college at the highest executive level, even though the female employee was not willing to file formal charges.

The administrator said Malik's contract with the college was not renewed for a variety of reasons, but primarily because he was involved in repeated conflicts with other staff members and had lost credibility with the faculty.

Roxbury's acting president, William B.D. Thompson, has declined repeatedly to take telephone calls from the Globe on the matter concerning Malik. Last week, he referred calls to the college's attorney, Judy Wong.

Wong said the college is in the process of working out a settlement agreement with Malik. ""I would rather not discuss it until it's in final form,"" she said, adding she hopes ""to wrap it up next week.""

Thomas Welch, chairman of the college's trustee board, said he had not seen a settlement agreement, though he said that Malik is no longer at the college.

Malik's attorney, Mark E. Schreiber, refused to comment on allegations against his client, saying Malik ""is entitled to some privacy.""

The sexual charges at Roxbury Community College surfaced several months ago. One of the women involved said she discussed her allegations with Thompson more than a year ago. In January, 21 members of the college's clerical staff sent a petition to Thompson, expressing their concern about rumors of sexual harassment on the campus. In mid-April, Welch said that a decision was imminent on the fate of Malik and that details would be released later that week.

""Nobody's saying anything. It's like 'out of sight, out of mind,' "" one of the women who signed the petition said last week. ""It's like saying that it's OK to do something like this.""

College records show that Malik's salary of $74,385 is an increase of almost $8,200 since he was hired two years ago. It is $16,385 more than the $58,000 salary Thompson receives.

The allegations arise at a time of serious fiscal crisis for public colleges. State schools have also been plagued recently by a spate of scandals, including trust fund abuses and financial mismanagement.""

The scientist threatened to derail the scientific careers of graduate students if they complained about him to authorities, according to a recent report to Congress from the National Science Foundation’s inspector general. The accused researcher, who was from an American institution of higher education, was directing studies at a field site in a foreign country under an NSF program designed to give undergraduate students an authentic research experience.

The report did not identify the researcher, his home institution at the time of the alleged incidents, or the foreign country, since the case has not yet been resolved. But it did state that the inspector general’s office had “determined that the researcher had been involved in 16 incidents of sexual misfeasance with female graduate and undergraduate students at the research site; on the way to the site; and in his home, car, and office.”

The report added that “many of these incidents were classifiable as sexual assaults.” The inspector general’s office also determined in an investigation that “these incidents were an integral part of this individual’s performance as a researcher and a research mentor and represented a serious deviation from accepted research practices.” """,1990,http://chronicle.com/article/NSF-Urged-to-Bar-Grants-to/85988,

Lasaga resigned that day for what then-Yale College Dean Richard Brodhead described as “personal reasons.”

The perverse details of Lasaga’s wrongdoing would emerge over the following months. On Lasaga’s computer, investigators found explicit videos the professor had shot of the boy, who was 13 at the time, in the Kline Geology Laboratory and even the Saybrook Master’s House. They also revealed that Lasaga was found to have built a digital collection of some 150,000 pornographic images.

Yet several of Lasaga’s colleagues pleaded in court for leniency in the professor’s case, with one professor from another university asserting that Lasaga was such an eminent scholar with so many research interests that he never could have had enough time to look at so much pornography.

Lasaga, meanwhile, pleaded guilty to both federal and state charges and has been incarcerated since being sentenced in 2002 to 20 years for the sexual-assault charges and a concurrent 15 years for federal pornography charges. The year before, Lasaga was fired by University President Richard Levin, who acted on the recommendation of the University Tribunal, Yale’s highest disciplinary body.

To make matters worse for the former master, a jury ruled in 2004 that Lasaga is liable for $16.5 million in damages to the boy he molested.

witnesses who complained about the individual, or both. Several of the specific incidents
described below demonstrate how HUC’s harassment prevention and response procedures
worked (or did not work) in practice, and they further illustrate some of the previously-discussed
themes that arose during our investigation. Where we had documentation or corroboration of
HUC’s response, we also named the administrators and faculty who responded to the misconduct. """,2021,http://huc.edu/sites/default/files/About/PDF/HUC%20REPORT%20OF%20INVESTIGATION%20--%2011.04.21.pdf,

Incident 8805,Resolved,2022-05-02,John Gainsford,Florida State University,Faculty,Professor,Arts and Humanities,Music,Suspended / Leave / Restrictions,"""The third investigation involved John “Read” Gainsford, a music professor still working in the College of Music. The university concluded after its investigation completed in July that Gainsford had improper sexual relationships with at least three students, even though he did not instruct or supervise them, because he holds “considerable institutional authority and influence within the college and subsequently over all College of Music students.”""

""Concern Regarding Consensual Relationship
The EDI Office found that, regardless of the fact that none of the confidential students Gainsford had sexual interactions with were supervised or evaluated by him, the nature of Gainsford’s role as a professor and Area Coordinator in the College of Music asserts a degree of institutional authority over students. Thus, a “romantic and/or sexual relationship with a student over which institutional authority is held is counter to that which is required of Prof. Gainsford in his role.” Further acknowledging that “real or perceived power over a person makes consent to sexual activity ambigious,” the investigation found that Gainsford’s relationship with the confidential reporter was a conflict of interest, and that respective claims by the reporter were substantiated. 

Following the conclusion of Professor Gainsford’s investigation by the EDI Office, former Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs Sally E. McRorie contacted Gainsford to inform him of his 10-day suspension without pay on Sep. 17, 2021. In the email, she explained that his behavior was “unbecoming of a public employee and adversely affected the University’s ability to provide a safe and secure learning environment for all students.”

In accordance with Article 20 of the FSU Board of Trustees/United Faculty of Florida Collective Bargaining Agreement, Gainsford voluntarily waived his right to appeal the decision of the investigation.""",2021,https://www.fsunews.com/story/news/2022/05/02/gainsford-case-determination-brings-closer-look-fsu-sexual-misconduct/9608069002/,

Under the terms of the settlement, documents relating to the disciplinary action were withdrawn from his personnel file.

“The parties desire to avoid the expense, inconvenience and uncertainty of continued proceedings and wish to resolve all disputes and claims between them,” the settlement stated.

The Title IX investigation uncovered that Bwambok was previously cautioned by his department chairman about inappropriately touching students. In early 2019, another student of Bwambok’s requested that the chairman bring up the topic after she described a lingering hug that made her uncomfortable. A formal complaint was never filed.

Neither of the professors responded to phone and email requests for comment.

Under the terms of the settlements, Morrissette and Bwambok did not acknowledge any wrongdoing. The Times obtained the settlements under the state’s open records law.

Both professors’ settlements came with a stipulation that they would not seek employment in the Cal State system again.
