We kept all of the stock below the display table, so I knelt on the floor to find his size when he said 'Whilst you're down there, why don't you take one for the team?'. As I was quite a naive 17 year old, I didn't quite understand, so I just awkwardly smiled and ignored it. After he bought the boots and left, I went to speak with my manager. She confirmed that he was actually insinuating I gave him a blowjob, I was shocked and quite upset! She told me to just 'ignore it and don't get upset by it'!
