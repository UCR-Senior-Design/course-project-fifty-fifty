http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama AM University fired a tenured professor in March after the school discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on campus, according to court documents.The school severed ties with Edward Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama AM. Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification.According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama AM, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama AM campus, the school said.Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama AM in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns.Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit.The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama AM police executed a search warrant, according to court documents.Once the videos were discovered, Alabama AM informed Jones he would be fired.""There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file.According to a memo from Alabama AM police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012.Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer.In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama AM administration for ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation.""Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act.""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,"" the lawsuit stated.In a statement to AL.com, Alabama AM denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross professional misconduct.""""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative.""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus."""

INTRODUCTION             On June 11, 1991, the plaintiff, Venus Longmire, filed this action pro se against  Alabama State University (ASU); Joe Reed, the Chairman of the Alabama State University Board of Trustees; and Leon Howard, a former president of Alabama State. Ms. Longmire alleged that the defendants had violated rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that Dr. Howard had committed a battery upon her, had falsely imprisoned her, had intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon her, and had defamed her. On September 13, 1991, Ms. Longmire, this time through counsel, filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint added all of the university trustees as defendants and redefined the claims. The claims as redefined are:     (1) That Ms. Longmire was sexually harassed in violation of rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) That Ms. Longmire was terminated from her employment in retaliation for her filing of a charge with the EEOC in violation of rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (3) That Alabama State University and its trustees negligently and wantonly failed to supervise Dr. Howard; (4) That Dr. Howard committed an assault and battery on Ms. Longmire; (5) That Dr. Howard invaded Ms. Longmire's privacy; (6) That Dr. Howard committed the tort of outrage against Ms. Longmire; (7) That all of the defendants breached a contract which they had with Ms. Longmire.              On October 13, 1991, Dr. Howard filed a counterclaim against Ms. Longmire which alleges that Ms. Longmire abused legal process and defamed him by accusing him of having attempted to rape her. Ms. Longmire, through counsel, filed a "" third amended complaint"" on January 13, 1992. The complaint added a claim that the sexual harassment also violated the Civil Rights Act of 1991. It also added claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for sexual discrimination and for violation of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A "" fourth amended complaint"" was filed on September 23, 1992. That complaint added a claim against Dr. Joe Reed alleging that Dr. Reed violated Ms. Longmire's constitutional rights by terminating her employment because she filed a complaint with the state Ethics Commission.    A second amended complaint was filed which simply changed the name of one of the trustees.            On July 31, 1992, United States District Judge Myron Thompson issued an order on the defendants' motions to dismiss. A supplemental order was filed on October 22, 1992. According to the terms of those orders, the only claims which Ms. Longmire may pursue against the trustees of Alabama State University are claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for injunctive relief in their official capacities. Alabama State University remains a defendant for purpose of the Title VII claim and Dr. Howard remains a defendant for the Title VII claims, the § 1983 claims, and the state law claims for assault, invasion of privacy, and outrageous conduct.            This case is currently pending on a series of discovery disputes. The issues have been briefed by the parties and the court held oral argument on the various issues on December 11, 1992.            II. DISCUSSION            The discovery phase of this case has been marked by hostility, anger and a general inability on the part of counsel to get along. The taking of depositions is almost always marked by scheduling problems. When the scheduling problems are resolved and the depositions commence, the court can always anticipate receiving calls from counsel to make rulings on problems which occur during the depositions. The difficulties with the depositions and the daily phone calls to the court caused the court to issue an extensive order concerning the conduct of counsel during depositions. The order was issued on October 7, 1992.             The court has had to involve itself in the minutiae of the discovery process. On November 6, 1992, the court was required to issue an order concerning the length of questioning during the plaintiff's deposition because of the inability of counsel to resolve the issue. Since October 30, 1992, at least nine  separate discovery motions have been filed. The court has held hearings on discovery matters on October 8, October 26, November 5, and December 11. It has issued orders on discovery matters on October 6, October 7, October 8, October 15, October 28, and November 6.            A. THE ISSUES IN JUDGE THOMPSON'S ORDER OF NOVEMBER 20            The serious discovery disputes in this case began on October 6, 1992 when the parties began taking depositions. The bulk of the disputes in this case have centered around the desire of counsel for Dr. Howard and Ms. Longmire to inquire, in deposition, about each others previous sexual activity. On October 15, 1992, this court entered an order limiting that inquiry. The parties then filed various pleadings asking that the limits on the inquiry about the sexual activities be changed. On October 28, 1992, the court entered another order relating to the scope of the parties inquiry about sexual activity. Under the terms of that order, counsel for the defendants were allowed to ask Ms. Longmire about her sexual activity with other persons while she was employed at Alabama State about which Dr. Howard had knowledge. Counsel for Ms. Longmire was allowed to ask questions about sexual activities which Dr. Howard may have had with persons with whom he had a supervisor/supervisee relationship or employer/employee relationship during his most recent term at Alabama State. All of the parties appealed the October 28 order.            Following a hearing on the appeal of the October 28 order, Judge Thompson, on November 20, 1992, issued an order directing the undersigned magistrate judge to review certain discovery issues which the parties had not yet presented. A hearing was held on those discovery issues on December 11, 1992. Each of those issues will be discussed in turn.    The district judge's order of November 20, 1992 also requested that the magistrate judge resolve the question of whether Ms. Longmire had laid sufficient predicate to inquire into certain alleged sexual relationships of Dr. Howard. That issue was resolved during the hearing which the magistrate judge held on November 20.            1. LONGMIRE'S INQUIRY INTO HOWARD'S ACTIVITIES AT JACKSON STATE            Dr. Howard left Alabama State to go to Jackson State University in 1976. He returned to Alabama State in 1984. Ms. Longmire contends that she should be allowed to ask Dr. Howard questions about his sexual activity with women other than his wife while he was employed at Jackson State and during his first employment at Alabama State.    These dates were provided to the court by the parties in open court during the December 11th hearing.             The limits which the court has placed on the inquiry about Dr. Howard's sexual activity on the Title VII and § 1983 claims by this court's order of October 28, 1992 appear appropriate under the case law. Evidence of Dr. Howard's sexual activities with women at Alabama State while Dr. Howard was employed there is relevant to the sexual harassment issues before the court. In Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1415 (10th Cir.1987), the court found that evidence of other acts of sexual harassment involving other employees was admissible in determining the "" hostile environment"" issue. See also Sowers v. Kemira, Inc., 701 F.Supp. 809, 813 (S.D.Ga.1988); Weiss v. Amoco Oil Co., 142 F.R.D. 311 (S.D.Iowa 1992). It is equally clear, however, that Dr. Howard's activities outside the work place are irrelevant. Tomson v. Stephan, 705 F.Supp. 530, 536 (D.Kan.1989).             The only argument which the Ms. Longmire makes is that evidence of Dr. Howard's activities at Jackson State are relevant to show that the university trustees knew or should have known that Dr. Howard engaged in improper sexual activities at Jackson State before they hired him. Unfortunately for Ms. Longmire, there is no issue before the court which requires any inquiry into what the university trustees knew when  they hired Dr. Howard in 1984. The negligent supervision claim which the plaintiff raised in her amended complaint has been dismissed. The only claims remaining before the court involving either the trustees or the university are the sexual harassment claims. The trustees' knowledge of Dr. Howard's sexual activity while at Jackson State are irrelevant to those claims.             The plaintiff has never specifically categorized her sexual harassment claim as either a "" quid pro quo"" claim or a "" hostile environment"" claim. If the plaintiff's claim is a "" quid pro quo"" claim, a theory of strict liability applies. If the plaintiff's claim is a "" hostile environment"" claim, she can prevail against the university defendants only if she shows that the defendants knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action against Dr. Howard. Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.1989). In either case, the trustees' knowledge of Dr. Howard's sexual activities at Jackson State or at ASU during his previous tenure is absolutely irrelevant.            This case has been marked by open hostility between counsel for the parties. It is important that this court place limits on inquiries into sensitive areas such as sexual activity in order to control the case. The limitations which the court has placed on the examination of Dr. Howard are consonant with both the letter and the spirit of Rule 26 and necessary to prevent unnecessary embarrassment and invasions of Dr. Howard's private life.            The court wishes to note, however, that its ruling is based on the present state of the record. If the plaintiff has actual evidence, not argument, which would establish a good faith basis for the inquiry about Dr. Howard's sexual activity at places other than Alabama State and some relevance to that inquiry, the plaintiff may make an ex parte motion under seal requesting that the court allow such inquiry.            2. HOWARD AND THE 404(B) EVIDENCE             The interests which Dr. Howard possesses in being free from harassment, embarrassment, and unnecessary invasions into his private life are also possessed by Ms. Longmire. She too has the right to be protected from an invasive inquiry which is irrelevant for discovery purposes. Indeed, courts need to be particularly vigilant in controlling discovery in sexual harassment cases. Priest v. Rotary, 98 F.R.D. 755, 761 (N.D.Cal.1983). In this case, Dr. Howard argues that evidence about Ms. Longmire's prior sexual activity is relevant because such evidence may be admissible under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.             Under Rule 404(b):     Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.              Dr. Howard argues that he should be allowed to inquire into Ms. Longmire's sexual history because "" it is submitted that evidence of any prior instance in which the plaintiff may have been engaged in sexual relationships with individuals in authority over her, resulting in the plaintiff accepting money or favors from such individuals after they have been placed in a compromising position, would be relevant to the plaintiff's motive, plan, or scheme in this case."" This sort of generalized allegation that there might be some 404(b) evidence somewhere in the case is insufficient to overcome the "" potential of the requested discovery to harass, intimidate and discourage the plaintiff in her efforts to prosecute her cause."" Priest, 98 F.R.D. at 761. "" Questions remote in time or place to the working environment are wholly irrelevant and unlikely to lead to admissible evidence. Such questions would only serve as tools of annoyance and harassment and serve no purpose."" Mitchell v. Hutchings, 116 F.R.D. 481, 485 (D.Utah 1987).             As with the ruling concerning the scope of the inquiry into Dr. Howard's past, this ruling is based on the record before the court. If the defendants have actual evidence, as opposed to argument, which would establish  a good faith basis for the inquiry about Ms. Longmire's past sexual activity and some relevance to it, they may make an ex parte motion under seal requesting that the court allow such inquiry.            3. LIMITS OF DISCOVERY ON THE DEFAMATION CLAIM             Ms. Longmire makes the further argument that she should be allowed to inquire into Dr. Howard's past sexual activities because Dr. Howard has filed a defamation action against her. Under well-settled Alabama law, a person who files a defamation action puts his or her character in issue. Parker v. Newman, 200 Ala. 103, 75 So. 479, 485 (1917). In a defamation action, the plaintiff may offer evidence of his good character and his character with reference to the matter charged in the defamation. Webb v. Gray, 181 Ala. 408, 62 So. 194, 198 (1913). See also Bill Steber Chevrolet-Oldsmobile, Inc. v. Morgan, 429 So.2d 1013, 1015 (Ala.1983). The defendant may then offer evidence of the plaintiff's bad character. Webb v. Gray, 62 So. at 198. Because Dr. Howard has placed his character "" in issue"" by filing a defamation action, his good or bad character may be proven by specific instances of his conduct. Fed.R.Evid. 405(b); Government of the Virgin Islands v. Grant, 775 F.2d 508, 511 (3rd Cir.1985).             In this case, Dr. Howard claims that he has been defamed by Ms. Longmire's statement that he attempted to rape her. Consequently, counsel for Ms. Longmire may ask Dr. Howard about any incidents where he is alleged to have assaulted other females or attempted to force them to have sex with him against their wills. If Dr. Howard intends to offer evidence of his general good character, then counsel for Ms. Longmire is free to ask questions about any extra-marital affair that Dr. Howard may have had while he was either at Jackson State or Alabama State.            B. THE OTHER PENDING DISCOVERY ISSUES            1. DISCOVERY FROM THE ASU TRUSTEES            The plaintiff has propounded a series of interrogatories to the individual members of the Alabama State University Board of Trustees. The court has reviewed the interrogatories and much of the information which the plaintiff seeks is beyond the knowledge of the trustees. During the hearing which was held in this case on December 11, counsel for the plaintiff indicated that she was requesting only that the trustees answer interrogatories directed to their personal knowledge of facts which are relevant to this case. The ASU trustees contend that they cannot be compelled to answer the interrogatories but that they will make themselves available for deposition and will respond to subpoenas duces tecum. The basis for the trustees' contentions is the order of the court granting them summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). The trustees' contention misapprehends the law.             The damage claim against the trustees in their individual capacities has been dismissed. They still remain as defendants in their official capacities for purposes of injunctive relief. Under well-settled law, the defense of qualified immunity is "" totally immaterial"" to claims for injunctive relief. Tubbesing v. Arnold, 742 F.2d 401, 404 (8th Cir.1984). Indeed, in cases where injunctive relief is requested, discovery should go forward even where defendants have prevailed on their qualified immunity defense. See, e.g., Lugo v. Alvarado, 819 F.2d 5 (1st Cir.1987). There are, of course, cases where parties remain as defendants after they have successfully litigated their qualified immunity defense because there is some susceptibility to injunctive relief. In such a case where a defendant remains for purposes of injunctive relief only and has no knowledge of the underlying facts of the case, no discovery from that defendant should be permitted. However, defendants who are in a case solely for injunctive relief purposes but who have knowledge of the facts of a case may be subjected to discovery even if their qualified immunity defense has been successful. Denton v. Twyford, 142 F.R.D. 140 (S.D.Ohio 1992).            In this case, the plaintiff has argued to the court that the trustees have personal knowledge of critical facts in this case. The trustees have presented no contrary evidence. Consequently, the trustees can be compelled to answer the plaintiff's interrogatories but only insofar as the interrogatories seek information about the trustees' personal knowledge or relevant facts. The only interrogatories which appear to the court to relate to the personal knowledge of the trustees are interrogatories 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 24 and 28.    The plaintiff's counsel served identical sets of interrogatories on ASU and its trustees. As a result, many of the interrogatories and requests for production of documents which are contained in the interrogatories to the trustees have nothing to do with the trustees. This absolute lack of specificity contributes unnecessary confusion. Unfortunately for ASU and the trustees, no objections to the interrogatories were filed within the time permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Had objections been made, the court would have directed plaintiff's counsel to file new interrogatories.            2. THE MARITAL PRIVILEGE ISSUE            During the deposition of Dr. Howard's wife, Caroline Howard, counsel for Dr. Howard repeatedly invoked the marital privilege and instructed Mrs. Howard not to answer the question. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel answers to those questions on November 16 and on November 30. The court has reviewed the questions to which the marital privilege was asserted. The court, during the hearing which was held on December 11, indicated its view that in certain instances the assertion of the privilege was proper but that in other instances the assertion of the privilege was frivolous. Counsel for the parties then agreed to meet to narrow the focus of the motion to compel.            3. LONGMIRE'S PRESENCE DURING DOCUMENT PRODUCTION             Plaintiff's counsel has insisted that Ms. Longmire be present during the production of documents. ASU and its trustees have objected to her presence during the production of personnel files. The decision as to whether a plaintiff should have personal access to personnel files during the discovery process requires that the competing interests be balanced. See, e.g., Rossini v. Ogilvy and Mather, Inc. 798 F.2d 590, 601 (2d Cir.1986). In this case, plaintiff's counsel has indicated to the court that the plaintiff's presence will make document production more efficient because of the plaintiff's personal knowledge of the case. The defendants have offered no evidence to the court that the plaintiff is likely to disseminate confidential information which she obtains during the course of discovery. Consequently, the oral motion of the defendants to exclude the plaintiff from production of the personnel files should be denied. See Cobb v. Rockefeller University, 1991 WL 222125, 1991 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 15278 (S.D.N.Y. October 24, 1991) (Plaintiff in a sex discrimination lawsuit should be allowed access to files of former colleagues even though those files contain confidential information about hiring and tenure.) Ms. Longmire is cautioned, however, that she will be required to abide by any order of this court concerning non-disclosure of information.            C. MISCELLANEOUS DISCOVERY ISSUES            1. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL FILED ON NOVEMBER 16            On November 16, 1992, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel seeking an order directing ASU and its trustees to respond to certain interrogatories and document requests. The question of whether the trustees must answer interrogatories has been discussed above. The issue of document production has been discussed at both the November 20 hearing and the December 11 hearing. On December 14, ASU was to produce the documents requested. Accordingly, the motion to compel is due to be granted insofar as it applies to the interrogatories directed to the ASU trustees. It is to be otherwise denied as moot, subject to renewal if the documents requested are not produced.            2. ASU'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER FILED DECEMBER 7             On December 7, 1992, ASU filed a motion for protective order concerning the scheduling  of certain depositions. The parties have agreed to a deposition schedule and the motion is, therefore, moot.            3. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL AND FOR SANCTIONS FILED ON DECEMBER 14            On December 14, 1992, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel relating to the deposition of Colonel Clarence Holloway. ASU arranged for Colonel Holloway to be deposed on the afternoon of December 14. Consequently, the motion to compel is moot. The motion for sanctions still remains.            III. CONCLUSION            For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED:            (1) That inquiry into sexual activities of Ms. Longmire and Dr. Howard with other persons be limited according to the terms of this court's order of October 28, 1992 with the following modification:     Ms. Longmire, through counsel, may question Dr. Howard about any incidents where he is alleged to have assaulted other females or attempted to force them to have sex with him since Dr. Howard has placed his character in issue by filing a claim for defamation. If Dr. Howard intends to offer evidence of his general good character, then counsel for Ms. Longmire is free to ask questions of Dr. Howard about any extra-marital affair he may have had since his initial employment at Alabama State;              (2) That the parties may file an ex parte motion under seal to expand the scope of the inquiry concerning sexual activities with other persons. The motion should contain, at a minimum, a recitation of the evidence which exists concerning the sexual activity about which the parties seek to inquire and a brief showing the relevance of the evidence. For example, if Dr. Howard wishes to inquire about an incident of sexual activity involving Ms. Longmire which occurred outside of the work place, he may file an ex parte motion under seal seeking leave of court to make such an inquiry. The motion should recite the evidence which he has concerning the sexual activity and the source of that evidence and a brief showing how evidence of that sexual activity is relevant under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If Ms. Longmire wishes to inquire about Dr. Howard's activity while he was at Jackson State, for example, she may file an ex parte motion under seal which recites the evidence which she has regarding that sexual activity and the source of the evidence and a brief showing how evidence of that sexual activity is relevant under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon a showing that there is a good faith basis for the inquiry and a showing that the inquiry is relevant, the court will issue and order permitting the inquiry. Such ex parte motions must be made in sufficient time to allow the court to consider the motion, issue a ruling and allow redeposition of either Dr. Howard or Ms. Longmire before the discovery cut-off date unless all parties agree that the redeposition may occur after that date;            (3) That the plaintiff's motion to compel filed on November 16, 1992 directed to the ASU trustees be granted in part and denied in part as follows. The ASU trustees shall serve full and complete answers to the following interrogatories on or before December 24, 1992: Interrogatories 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 24, 28 and 29. The motion to compel is denied as moot insofar as it relates to the production of documents. The motions, however, may be renewed;            (4) That the plaintiff's motion to compel filed November 16, 1992 and the motion to compel answers or motion to suppress filed November 30, 1992 be denied as moot. The motions, however, may be renewed;            (5) That the motion for protective order filed by ASU on December 7, 1992 be denied as moot; and            (6) That the motion to compel and motion for sanctions filed on December 14, 1992 be denied in part as follows: The motion insofar as it seeks to compel the deposition of Dr. Clarence Holloway is denied as moot.

			A federal jury returned a verdict totaling more than $1 million Friday evening against Alabama State University.The jury found that the school had allowed an administrator to create a hostile work environment by racially and sexually harassing three female employees and that the women were retaliated against after they filed complaints.""Justice is served,"" said Cynthia Williams as she walked out of the courthouse about 6 p.m. Friday, alongside the two other plaintiffs, Jacqueline Weatherly and Lydia Burkhalter, who echoed the sentiment.The jury of four men and four women returned a verdict that includes compensation for emotional pain and mental anguish; back pay for Williams and Burkhalter, who were fired; and lost leave time for Weatherly.Kenneth Thomas, lead attorney for ASU in the case, said the defense team was disappointed but must accept the jury's decision.""(We are) just taking the jury verdict, reviewing and analyzing the university's options and (will be) discussing with appropriate university officials the next step to protect the university's interests,"" Thomas said without elaborating on what steps ASU might take.In a statement released Friday night, university spokesman Kenneth Mullinax indicated that ASU will consider appealing the verdict.The jury found that Lavonette Bartley, an ASU employee for about 27 years, created a racially hostile environment for all three women. She was accused of regularly using the N-word, calling one of the plaintiffs a ""white bitch"" and a number of other specific allegations. The jury also ruled in favor of Burkhalter's claim of sexual harassment.The plaintiffs, and Bartley, are black women with the exception of Burkhalter, who is described in court documents as biracial.Bartley was accused of making inappropriate comments about the then-24-year-old Burkhalter's body and clothes, suggesting Burkhalter strip to show how many tattoos she had and inappropriately brushing her body against Burkhalter in a narrow filing room.Bartley is the associate executive director in the office of Executive ASU Vice President and Chief Operating Officer John Knight. She works in Knight's office in Suite 119 of Council Hall on the ASU campus, where all three plaintiffs also have worked.The lawsuit also accused Knight of making romantic advances toward Burkhalter, although the verdict itself did not make it clear whether the jury's decision on sexual harassment included one or the other of those claims or both.The statement ASU released Friday night reads, in part:""Alabama State University maintains an equal opportunity environment committed to our founding principles of excellence and equality in higher education and has strong policies and procedures in place to prohibit discrimination and harassment of any individual. We will continue to ensure that all of our employees are guaranteed equal protection, not only to the letter of the law, but also to our higher expectations.""The trial lasted eight days and included testimony from some well-known elected officials, including Knight, a longtime state legislator.Also taking the stand were three members of the ASU board of trustees: Elton Dean, who is also chairman of the Montgomery County Commission; Marvin Wiggins, a Dallas County Circuit Court judge; and Herbert Young.The trustees all denied under oath that the plaintiffs had spoken to them about wanting transfers and about their issues with Bartley.The plaintiffs testified under oath that they had spoken with the trustees.Knight's testimony included denials of claims against him and that he had never heard Bartley use the N-word or other derogatory terms while on the ASU campus.The jury of four men and four women awarded Weatherly $350,000; Burkhalter $230,000; and Williams $213,500 for emotional pain and mental anguish.Jurors also awarded Williams $141,573.76 and Burkhalter $94,592.51 in back pay and Weatherly $9,453.06 in lost leave time.The jury deliberated for about 12 hours on the verdict, which included a number of specific charges. Toward the end of deliberations, jurors requested a calculator.

			A federal jury returned a verdict totaling more than $1 million Friday evening against Alabama State University.The jury found that the school had allowed an administrator to create a hostile work environment by racially and sexually harassing three female employees and that the women were retaliated against after they filed complaints.""Justice is served,"" said Cynthia Williams as she walked out of the courthouse about 6 p.m. Friday, alongside the two other plaintiffs, Jacqueline Weatherly and Lydia Burkhalter, who echoed the sentiment.The jury of four men and four women returned a verdict that includes compensation for emotional pain and mental anguish; back pay for Williams and Burkhalter, who were fired; and lost leave time for Weatherly.Kenneth Thomas, lead attorney for ASU in the case, said the defense team was disappointed but must accept the jury's decision.""(We are) just taking the jury verdict, reviewing and analyzing the university's options and (will be) discussing with appropriate university officials the next step to protect the university's interests,"" Thomas said without elaborating on what steps ASU might take.In a statement released Friday night, university spokesman Kenneth Mullinax indicated that ASU will consider appealing the verdict.The jury found that Lavonette Bartley, an ASU employee for about 27 years, created a racially hostile environment for all three women. She was accused of regularly using the N-word, calling one of the plaintiffs a ""white bitch"" and a number of other specific allegations. The jury also ruled in favor of Burkhalter's claim of sexual harassment.The plaintiffs, and Bartley, are black women with the exception of Burkhalter, who is described in court documents as biracial.Bartley was accused of making inappropriate comments about the then-24-year-old Burkhalter's body and clothes, suggesting Burkhalter strip to show how many tattoos she had and inappropriately brushing her body against Burkhalter in a narrow filing room.Bartley is the associate executive director in the office of Executive ASU Vice President and Chief Operating Officer John Knight. She works in Knight's office in Suite 119 of Council Hall on the ASU campus, where all three plaintiffs also have worked.The lawsuit also accused Knight of making romantic advances toward Burkhalter, although the verdict itself did not make it clear whether the jury's decision on sexual harassment included one or the other of those claims or both.The statement ASU released Friday night reads, in part:""Alabama State University maintains an equal opportunity environment committed to our founding principles of excellence and equality in higher education and has strong policies and procedures in place to prohibit discrimination and harassment of any individual. We will continue to ensure that all of our employees are guaranteed equal protection, not only to the letter of the law, but also to our higher expectations.""The trial lasted eight days and included testimony from some well-known elected officials, including Knight, a longtime state legislator.Also taking the stand were three members of the ASU board of trustees: Elton Dean, who is also chairman of the Montgomery County Commission; Marvin Wiggins, a Dallas County Circuit Court judge; and Herbert Young.The trustees all denied under oath that the plaintiffs had spoken to them about wanting transfers and about their issues with Bartley.The plaintiffs testified under oath that they had spoken with the trustees.Knight's testimony included denials of claims against him and that he had never heard Bartley use the N-word or other derogatory terms while on the ASU campus.The jury of four men and four women awarded Weatherly $350,000; Burkhalter $230,000; and Williams $213,500 for emotional pain and mental anguish.Jurors also awarded Williams $141,573.76 and Burkhalter $94,592.51 in back pay and Weatherly $9,453.06 in lost leave time.The jury deliberated for about 12 hours on the verdict, which included a number of specific charges. Toward the end of deliberations, jurors requested a calculator.

Dr. Philip Jemilohun, who has been an ASU faculty member since August 2007, is now on administrative leave without pay pending the criminal disposition.  The charges stem from two student complaints made with the ASU Police Department. The ASU Police Department launched an investigation and submitted its investigative report to the Dougherty County District Attorney's Office, which agreed that criminal charges should be sought.    ""When the students came forward with their complaints, we took them seriously,"" said ASU Police Chief Roberson Brown. ""The University will continue its own administrative investigation while the criminal charges are being pursued. In all situations, the safety of our students is always our top priority. If there are other students with similar complaints, they should contact ASU Police Department or the District Attorney's Office to file a complaint. We are committed to making sure that our students are protected,"" said Brown.  Jemilohun remains in the Dougherty County Jail tonight.  He is being held on $100,000 bond."

http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/investigations/2015/10/15/public-disservice-asu-discrimination-harassment-settlements/73852816/,"Nine settlements cost ASU $854,000 over five years, the second largest amount in the stateThe university paid two settlements after doctoral students said professors sexually harassed themThe two settlements involved the ASU’s criminology departmentMeaghan Paulhamus came to Arizona expecting to pursue her academic dream working for a top criminology scholar.Paulhamus, now in non-profit administration, was pursuing her doctoral degree in criminology at Northeastern University in Boston when her mentor, Robert Kane, told her he was leaving for Arizona State University.Eager to keep working with him, Paulhamus transferred to ASU where Kane would supervise and mentor her.But soon after she arrived in August 2008, she says Kane began making comments about her chest. Three months later, Kane allegedly walked out of a hotel bathroom at an out-of-town conference with his pants down.Paulhamus sued the Arizona Board of Regents, which oversees state universities. The board settled the case, with the state paying her a six-figure settlement while denying liability or wrongdoing.A high costPaulhamus’ case wasn’t an anomaly for Arizona or the university.The state paid $854,000 to settle nine lawsuits with ASU employees, mostly for racial and sexual discrimination from 2009 to 2014. The total payout was the second highest among state entities, and the number of cases was more than any other state agency.Paulhamus’ case is one of 57 claims by state workers — most alleging sexual, racial and age discrimination and harassment — investigated by The Arizona Republic. More than half the employees who filed claims said they were penalized by retaliation, while the accused went virtually unpunished — in many cases, they continued to garner pay raises and promotions.Phoenix civil-rights attorney Stephen Montoya said a $100,000 payout is a large settlement in an employment law case, and ASU had four that settled for that amount or more in the five-year span studied. If legal costs are included, that number rises to six.By comparison, eight settlements at the University of Arizona totaled $114,000, while three at Northern Arizona University cost $54,500. The UA’s largest settlement was $25,000, while NAU’s was $50,000. With 10,544 full-time equivalent employees, ASU actually has less than UA, which has 11,234. NAU has 3,199 full time equivalent employees. None of the figures include graduate student workers.Montoya said ASU’s record indicates a culture that allows bad behavior to go unpunished, with ASU administrators hoping it all “will go away.”ASU spokesman Mark Johnson would not speak to the particulars of any lawsuit, but suggested in a statement that it would be wrong to infer that the university has a problem with discrimination or harassment.“It is our hope that your story will reflect that in our legal system — nationally, not just in Arizona — claims are routinely settled for reasons other than whether the case has any merit,” Johnson said. “They often are resolved on the basis of cost; that fighting a claim would be more expensive than reaching a settlement.”Student harassedNeither Kane nor Paulhamus would discuss the case. The following account is from court records and ASU disciplinary records.Paulhamus claimed the harassment began with Kane’s comments about how well her clothing showed off her chest. He told Paulhamus he liked hearing rumors that they were sleeping together and he felt an amount of “ownership” of her.Throughout the late summer and fall of 2008, Kane told her he was “imagining” her in a swimsuit. In the fall, when Paulhamus e-mailed him saying she was concerned about inappropriate comments being made by fellow doctoral students, Kane e-mailed back: “I’m trying really hard (and failing) not to think about you in different sexual positions.”He sent her text messages and late-night e-mails, asking her what graduate students she would date. He said if he were a grad student, he would be very attracted to her, according to court records.In November 2008, when both traveled to a conference in St. Louis, Paulhamus purposely stayed at a different hotel. Kane repeatedly called her, sent her texts, asked to get drinks and insisted they prepare for a presentation in his hotel room.When Paulhamus got there, Kane went to change in the bathroom. He left the door open and then emerged with his pants down. He finished dressing in front of her, several times asking her opinion of the clothing he had selected to wear.Discrimination claims at ASU appear in varied formsAt the presentation, he rubbed his hand on her leg underneath the table. Later that night, Kane insisted that he buy her a drink and that she come to his hotel room. He sent her texts until 12:30 or 1 a.m., suggesting they meet at another hotel so that no one else could see them. When she declined, he said it was too bad because he wanted to kiss her goodnight.Paulhamus later met Kane at a coffee shop to tell him his behavior was inappropriate and that it had to stop. He excused it, saying he was drunk. And after that meeting, she said Kane retaliated against her, becoming much more critical and condescending toward her work.Paulhamus went to the university’s human-resources office and was directed to meet with Scott Decker, then-director of ASU’s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice.Decker, also named in the lawsuit, suggested Paulhamus change her course of study to a “more traditional” area for women. He also made comments suggesting he thought she and Kane had a consensual sexual relationship.Decker assigned her to a female professor who later released her as a teaching assistant. Unable to find a faculty mentor, and with Decker refusing to assign one to her, Paulhamus took medical leave from ASU and never returned.In 2011, she sued the Board of Regents, Kane and Decker, accusing them of sexual harassment and retaliation. In August 2011, she settled for $100,000. ASU spent another $31,000 to fight the case.Shortly after settling, ASU gave Kane a letter of admonishment.The letter said that “while some of the student’s allegations were unfounded,” Kane’s conduct violated university policies on nondiscrimination, anti-harassment, non-retaliation, sexual harassment and the university’s code of ethics. The letter said he showed a lack of professional judgment and called his conduct unacceptable. For the next year, he was was not allowed to make trips funded by the school, teach additional courses, or be assigned a student mentor or assistant. Kane left shortly thereafter.Kane now leads the Criminology and Justice Studies Program at Drexel University in Philadelphia. ASU hired him back as a senior consultant from January 2012 to August 2014, paying him $9,000 a year.Not the only caseDecker was named in a second lawsuit during the same period.Tasha Kunzi, a doctoral student, became romantically involved with professor Travis Pratt in 2009, according to court records. After Kunzi broke off the relationship in 2010, her lawsuit alleged, Pratt retaliated against her and threatened to ruin her career unless they got back together.Database of state discrimination settlementsCourt documents alleged other professors, including then-department chairman Decker, refused to do meaningful work with Kunzi. Decker assigned her to clerical work. Prior to that, she had been assigned research projects. Kunzi left in 2011. Pratt called her new employer “to reveal the details of Kunzi’s departure from ASU,” her lawsuit states.The lawsuit also alleged Pratt and Decker discriminated against Kunzi’s new husband by unfairly grading his doctoral examination in 2012.Kunzi settled for $44,000 in 2014. ASU spent roughly $104,000 in legal fees and associated costs. Pratt could not be reached for comment and did not respond to a letter hand-delivered to his home.Decker’s personnel record shows he never faced discipline at ASU. In 2015, he became the director of ASU’s new Center for Public Criminology.Decker said he could not comment on the cases because they involve legal matters, but noted he was dropped from the Kunzi lawsuit before it was settled.Pratt in 2012 was given a letter of admonishment, which reduced his salary by 10 percent, discontinued a $10,000 stipend and removed his title of “faculty exemplar.”His admonishment letter said Pratt assured the school’s dean there would be no repeat of his conduct. But at the time, Pratt already was involved in a relationship with another student, according to ASU disciplinary records.He was fired after that relationship was discovered in 2013. His conduct was partly responsible for the ASU faculty approving a more restrictive policy on faculty-student dating.Montoya, Kunzi’s lawyer, said ASU previously had a “laughable and ridiculous policy of permitting so-called amorous relationships. ... It’s almost always the student that is damaged.”He said filing a complaint is often academically destructive and emotionally embarrassing, and can spur retribution.“The cost of complaining is so profound,” Montoya said. “Oftentimes, it turns the entire department against you.”"
http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/barrett-the-honors-college-at-asu-is-a-close-knit-community-some-say-too-close-6633269,"
One morning last spring, Becca Smouse, a first-year student at Arizona State University's Barrett, The Honors College, jumped in her car and headed to Tempe for her intensive freshman seminar course, the Human Event.
The Human Event in many ways is the linchpin of Barrett's programming. It covers an ambitious topic -- the history of human ideas -- and is designed to challenge how students think through intensive reading, writing, and discussion.
Through the Human Event class and subsequent study-abroad trips, Barrett students begin to form the strong relationships with professors they will need as they move on to become teaching assistants and interns, to seek supervisors for their honors theses, and to apply for graduate school and jobs. The class is important, and so are the relationships it helps students to form.
But that March day, Smouse and her classmates found an unexpected note on their classroom door. It informed them that their professor, Dr. Joel Hunter, wouldn't make it in that day, or for the rest of the week. 

Smouse found the message odd, especially because Hunter usually was very communicative and it was unlike him to let students come all the way to campus just to find out that class was canceled. ""Why didn't he just e-mail us?"" she wondered.
Turns out, Dr. Hunter was never coming back.
A substitute arrived the next week, and students were told that Hunter wouldn't return that semester. Smouse says she and other students were worried about him at first.
Then, rumors began to swirl. Jokes about Hunter getting fired for sleeping with a student soon turned into campus-wide gossip.
But Barrett's administration remained silent. Smouse says she was disappointed in the lack of transparency, especially given the tight-knit nature of the school.
And she began to hear another rumor: This wasn't the first time something like this had happened at Barrett.
When an anonymously written blog post confirmed the gossip about Hunter, Smouse, a young journalist in training, responded the only way she knew how. She wrote about it, in an April 14 opinion piece for ASU's campus newspaper, The State Press.
""Unfortunately, the professor's controversial dismissal seems to have been left largely untouched by Barrett administration,"" she wrote. ""Rumors buzzing and parental concerns rising, the spotlight is shining brightly on the college's lack of acknowledgement. Many also see firing the professor as a cop-out, simply sweeping the problem under the rug of Barrett embarrassments. By cutting out the professor, it seems the college hoped to avoid confronting the situation all together.""
Turns out, sweeping Barrett's troubles under the rug hasn't been so easy.

One of Rebecca Smouse's Barrett classmates, Jane -- who asked to not be identified by her real name -- also was disappointed in the school's response.
But Jane wasn't just a student in Joel Hunter's class. She also was his lover.
In an April 10 blog post for a website called Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, Jane laid out details about her relationship with Hunter, the process of reporting him to the school, and his subsequent dismissal.
In the first 72 hours after her post was published, an attached petition calling on Barrett's dean to fire predatory professors collected more than 400 signatures.
""For the past 15 years, ASU's Barrett Honors College has been home to professors who sexually harass and sexually abuse students,"" the petition says. ""While romantic relationships between professors and students may seem consensual, the imbalance of power makes these relationships inherently coercive and abusive.""
Today, the petition has more than 1,000 signatures.
Jane's story is not unique.
In the past few years, Barrett has terminated the contracts of at least three professors who engaged in sexual relationships with students. Joel Hunter and Dr. Eric Susser were told their contracts were not being renewed after they admitted to violating ASU's student-professor relationship policies, and Dr. David Conz committed suicide after his contract was dropped when a student reported he'd given alcohol to the Barrett freshman he was dating. Police records, documents given to New Times by involved students, and reports by other media outlets confirm the terminations.
But some say the number of Barrett faculty members skirting the rules -- and whose contracts may have been dropped -- actually is far higher.
Barrett administrators aren't talking, but Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, replied on their behalf. ""Such relationships are inappropriate and do not comport with how we expect members of the faculty and lecturers to behave,"" Johnson says, ""and when such relationships are brought to our attention, appropriate steps are taken.""
In a three-month investigation of the issues at Barrett, New Times interviewed former and current Barrett students and staff and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal university documents, written student testimonials provided to the government in a formal complaint, and police reports.
ASU president Michael Crow did not respond to an interview request. Many of New Times' public records requests -- asking for everything from personnel files to police reports on these and other cases -- went largely ignored or unfilled. Much is still unknown.
But one thing is clear: Inappropriate student-professor relationships at Barrett have been a poorly kept secret for years.
ASU has, in fact, had its share of troubles when it comes to sex.
In May 2014, just a few weeks after Jane's blog post was published, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights made an unprecedented move: It announced the names of all schools being investigated for possible violations of Title IX, the federal legislation dictating how sexual violence and harassment complaints should be handled at schools that receive federal funding.
ASU was on the list of 55 schools. A Department of Education spokesman says the Office for Civil Rights is still investigating the university, but he did not provide further details.
For the most part, the problems at ASU have been linked to two worlds where these issues are better known: fraternities and athletics. ASU previously settled federal lawsuits dealing with the university's responses to two alleged sexual assaults, one involving a football player and the other a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
But a Title IX complaint filed in June 2014 by Jasmine Lester, a former Barrett student, asks the Office for Civil Rights to focus on a different sexual abuse problem on campus: that of professors sleeping with their undergraduate students.
At Barrett, and across all of ASU, professor-student relationships are banned in certain contexts, like when a student is currently in a professor's class or when a professor is supervising a student's thesis. But this policy still allows room for involvement between professors and students.
And particularly at Barrett, which educates more than 5,000 of ASU's nearly 60,000 undergraduates, there have been repeated issues with professors skirting -- sometimes, even defying -- the rules.
Prestigious universities across the nation have drawn much harder lines in regard to such relationships. In 2010, Yale University banned faculty members from forming relationships with any undergraduate students, noting in its updated policy that undergrads ""are particularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship."" In 2013, the University of Connecticut implemented a similar ban.
Last fall, ASU's faculty senate debated whether to replace its own policy with an outright ban on professor-undergraduate relationships.
At a senate meeting in November, Cynthia Tompkins, chair of the committee drafting the proposed policy changes, referenced the scope of ASU's problem. She said at least 20 faculty members across ASU have been dismissed for having inappropriate sexual relationships with students in recent years.
ASU hasn't provided the exact number of dismissals stemming from Barrett or elsewhere. ""We do not keep a running tally of faculty who are disciplined for [relationship policy] violations,"" a spokesman says. A representative from the university office charged with investigating these policy violations wouldn't comment on how many investigations she has conducted.
But when ASU was named on the list of schools under federal review, Michael Crow did speak to The State Press' editorial board, and he addressed the problem at Barrett.
Student journalist Nicholas Palomino Mendoza reported on May 7, 2014, that Crow said he was aware of ""reports of inappropriate sexual conduct between Barrett faculty and students.""
""If it's consensual in a sense of the way that the law looks at things,"" Mendoza quotes Crow as saying, ""then it is inappropriate from the perspective of how we expect our faculty members or our instructors to behave.""
""There have been professors in relationships with students, and when we find out about it, they are all fired,"" Crow told the paper.
The revisions to ASU's professor-undergraduate relationship policy would aim to switch the school's focus from reactive to proactive, and from firing violators to improving the culture around these relationships on the front end.
At the first reading of the proposed revisions in early October, Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, made clear what the policy changes would mean.
""To put it rather bluntly,"" she said, ""ASU students are not part of your dating pool.""

Barrett, the Honors College, is a school within a school.
Admissions documents say Barrett consists of ""living-learning communities"" of academically driven students from across ASU's four campuses. Barrett is where the cream of the ASU crop goes to be educated.
Barrett marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. The University Honors College was granted official status in 1988, when it became the first residential honors college in the nation. It was renamed for former Intel CEO Craig Barrett and his wife, Barbara, a former ambassador to Finland and Arizona gubernatorial candidate, after they endowed the school with a $10 million gift in 2000. The college has undergone great growth in recent years, with its current student body size rivaling its alumni population.
In its admissions literature, Barrett distinguishes itself from the wider university. Though the majority of ASU students were in the top 25 percent of their graduating high school classes, for example, most Barrett students were in the top 10 percent. One year, students donned T-shirts that read ""_arrett, the Honors College. We don't get B's.""
All of Barrett's honors faculty fellows hold Ph.D.s, and the school boasts a 15-to-1 student-faculty ratio, small in comparison to ASU's ratio of 22-to-1. Students, sometimes called ""The Commas"" in a reference to the school's stuffy title, almost universally refer to Barrett as tight-knit.
The college's largest campus is at the corner of Apache Boulevard and Rural Road in Tempe, neatly tucked behind a set of iron gates on ASU's central campus. The Barrett campus is fully enclosed, and were it not for some classes they take elsewhere, Barrett students practically could spend their college lives there. Students are, in fact, expected to live on campus for at least their first two years.
Barrett's central campus is reminiscent of the exclusive private schools Barrett emulates. It's got everything but the ivy and, indeed, references to the Ivy League (Harvard of the Southwest, anyone?) are not uncommon. Some students jokingly refer to the campus as ""The Nerd Cage.""
Outside, students gather in groups and study in solitude on the sandstone benches surrounding Barrett's green lawns. There's an outdoor fireplace for cold-weather gatherings and a volleyball pit.
Inside, Barrett's buildings serve multiple purposes, reflecting the insular nature of the Barrett community. One can find professors' offices, student dorms, and classrooms interspersed throughout any given structure.
In the Honors Hall -- in many ways, the hub of Barrett life -- there's a gym with flat-screen TVs and elliptical machines, a spiral staircase leading downstairs to a coffee shop, and a recreational area with ping-pong tables.
There's also the beautiful Refectory, or, as students call it in a reference to Harry Potter's Hogwarts, the Great Hall. On a Friday afternoon in December, one student casually played the grand piano as others sat at long tables with high-backed chairs and feasted in the hall's wood-paneled dining room.
In an adjacent hallway, photographs of Barrett students who went on to win prestigious fellowships line the walls: 185 Fulbright scholars, 52 Marshall scholars, 54 Goldwater scholars. The list goes on.
Barrett students major in any field they choose, taking classes in the disciplinary college of their choice. One student says there can be tension between Barrett and the rest of ASU, in part because of the special privileges afforded to Barrett students. Barrett students get to register for classes before others, for example, and sometimes are offered special courses the general ASU population can't take.
This includes the Human Event, a mandatory two-semester seminar taken during freshmen year.
Barrett freshmen may take a different professor for each semester of the intensive course, but they are encouraged to stick with one. They also are encouraged to participate in for-credit, study-abroad trips with their professors during the summer after the course finishes.
The Human Event is ""a wonderful course to get students into the idea of working closely with a professor,"" says a former staff member who asked to not be identified. But she says she also believes the class has contributed to the problem of too-close professor-student relations.
""Because it was so friendly,"" she says, ""if you had any faculty members who were not terribly ethical in how they related to youngsters, it was a situation in which they could take advantage.""
With these professors, sources tell New Times, office hours turn into intimate meetings. Examination of the ancient Greeks may have an odd focus on the sexual relationships between mentors and mentees. Trips abroad are fueled more by alcohol than by learning.
To many, Barrett's very structure, intended to create a close learning community for students and professors alike, has instead become something sinister: a way for predatory teachers to grow close to -- sometimes, even sexually -- the young and ambitious students in their tutelage.

Jane first was drawn to Barrett because of its strong sense of community. She enrolled in the school in 2012.
Her story unfolds in her blog post, interviews and e-mails with New Times, and a pile of documents she provided to the government in a Title IX complaint against ASU. The documents include Jane's personal e-mails and text messages as well as copies of e-mails she received from ASU detailing the investigation into and eventual dismissal of Dr. Joel Hunter.
Hunter, a Barrett faculty member since 2008, admitted to the university and to New Times that he violated ASU's professor-undergraduate relationships policy before his contract was dropped.
On his personal website, Hunter lists the many awards he won during his time at Barrett, including accolades for teaching excellence, academic service, and faculty mentoring.
Since he left the school, Hunter also has posted a lengthy student tutorial on how to succeed in Barrett's difficult freshmen seminar course. ""It is best to err on the side of formality,"" he wrote in a late September post focused on how to best communicate with one's Human Event professor. These professors are ""incredibly friendly and funny, yes,"" he writes, ""but they are not in your peer group.""
It seems hindsight is 20/20.
By the end of Jane's fall semester in Hunter's Human Event class, she and the professor had grown close.
In December 2012, Hunter e-mailed Jane, asking her to interrupt a meeting so it wouldn't drag on. ""Plus, I would get to see one of my favorite Human Event students twice in one day,"" he wrote.
Jane signed up to take Hunter's class again in the spring.
By January 2013, the two began getting together regularly for meetings and meals. Soon, they were texting, and by early February, their texts hinted at a sexual relationship.
Some texts reference a trip the two took to a local park, where Jane says Hunter provided her with alcohol and massaged her, suggesting that doing so would be easier if she didn't have clothes on. They spent the afternoon kissing.
A few weeks later, Hunter texted Jane about 2 a.m. from a Harry Potter conference he was attending in Albuquerque:
Joel: get your ass to albuquerque now dammit. I just closed down the hotel bar with a harry potter student of mine who will not, i'm sure of it, sleep with me. All alone am i . . .
Jane alleges that Hunter shared with her sexual fantasies about other Human Event students and said he'd fallen in love with a student before.
The two went on to have a covert sexual relationship -- aside from the clear violation of policy, Hunter was married with children -- having sex in cars, in Hunter's office, and in parking garages around campus. Jane says Hunter gave her extensions on schoolwork because of their relationship.
In their talks, interspersed with innuendo, was conversation about Jane's future.
Texts from the day after their trip to the park:
Jane: How is my letter of recommendation coming? :)
Joel: It'll be done this afternoon.
And an hour later:
Joel: Letter submitted electronically. They won't be able to give you the scholarship quickly enough . . .
Jane: You mean I don't get to read it? Noooooooooooooo
Joel: I'll share it with you later. It's totally hot.
Then, in April of Jane's freshman year, Barrett Professor David Conz committed suicide shortly after his teaching contract was dropped. Conz's dismissal was linked to a relationship with one of his Human Event students. Jane says Hunter made out Conz to be the victim of an unfair administration and began expressing fears about losing his own job.
A text conversation in the days that followed:
Jane: I know you didn't want a hug, but are you ok? I don't think I've ever seen you look so sad.
Joel: Im ok. Shook up, sad and feeling vulnerable. Life. 
In May 2013, Jane and Hunter had sexual intercourse in a motel.
The spring semester came to a close, and Jane fully expected that she and Hunter would resume their relationship when she returned for her sophomore year. The two even texted occasionally during the summer.
But when Jane returned to campus in August, she says, Hunter told her he'd learned that their affair was risky after a discussion at a Barrett faculty retreat. He abruptly broke off the relationship.
""One thing my professor said to me when he ended this affair still sticks out to me,"" Jane wrote in the closing of her Title IX complaint testimony. ""He had no idea that what he was doing was wrong or even against the rules, because it was so common for Barrett Honors College professors to be involved with students that all of the honors faculty saw it as normal.""
Hunter declined to be interviewed, and New Times isn't aware of what he is up to today. On his personal website, he says he is a married father of three.

On a Monday afternoon in early November, Arizona State University's faculty senate gathered to discuss, among other things, a motion to revise the Academic Affairs Manual (ACD) policy governing ""amorous relationships"" between professors and students. That policy, ACD 402, has been on the books since 1982.
In Tempe's Education Lecture Hall, a single observer watched from a seat toward the back. Jasmine Lester, a 2011 Barrett grad, is a small woman with curly brown hair. She wears glasses and looks younger than her 25 years.
Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, first laid out some ground rules. She asked senate members to refrain from dominating, and she made clear just who was invited to discuss this motion.
""Observers are welcome to observe as much as you want,"" she said. ""But be like children. You may be seen but not heard.""
For many years, ASU's amorous relationships guidelines fell under the university's sexual harassment policy. But in 2011, they were parsed to create a policy focused exclusively on consensual romantic or sexual student-professor relationships.
As written today, ACD 402 bans ASU employees from making key decisions -- grading, hiring, disciplining, or offering recommendations -- over anyone with whom they are in a sexual relationship. The policy bans faculty members from engaging in relationships with any students currently enrolled in their classes, and it says violations can result in disciplinary action up to termination.
But in 2014, the senate began considering revisions to ACD 402 that would give the policy much greater reach, banning all relationships between ASU faculty and undergraduate students.
If approved, the revisions would require faculty members to report any such relationships to a supervisor immediately, with policy exemptions made on a case-by-case basis.
""Our current policies regarding faculty-student relationships are inadequate as written,"" university spokesman Mark Johnson tells New Times. ""The faculty senate should be applauded for taking steps to strengthen those policies to ensure that faculty members and lecturers have only professional relationships with students.""
That November day, Cynthia Tompkins, who chaired the policy-revision task force, addressed the faculty senate. During the month-long comment period that preceded this meeting, she explained, many seemed to think the proposed revisions had come out of left field.
Tompkins acknowledged that professor-student relationships historically have had a wide range of acceptability -- you hear stories of professor-student couples that happily marry, she noted -- but she said many unacceptable versions have taken place at ASU in recent years.
In addition to the 20 firings mentioned above, Tompkins said, ASU has had at least one unwanted student-professor pregnancy this year.
The intent of the policy revisions, she said, is to put students back at the center of focus.
The floor was opened for discussion. Faculty members approached the microphone to raise questions and concerns.
Many were worried about the scope of the revised language. ASU is a big school. Would professors need to start IDing everyone they meet in Tempe?
The new language doesn't make clear just which relationships would be exempt. What about pre-existing ones? And what would happen if a professor reports a relationship and doesn't get an exemption?
""You really think about whether you want that relationship,"" Ossipov answered. ""One person would have to leave the university.""
Tensions rose.
""I want to be blunt. I think this policy is very invasive,"" a female faculty member said. ""Every amorous relationship is not a 40-year-old faculty member and an 18-year-old-student.""
Concerns were raised about privacy and the motion's intrusiveness and scope.
Finally, a frustrated female senator in the back of the auditorium walked up to the microphone and moved to vote down the controversial motion.
Twenty senators voted in favor of the policy revision. One abstained from voting.
And with 62 votes against the changes, the motion was -- for the time being, at least -- dead.
Ossipov said the motion would be returned to Tompkins' committee for further revisions. ""However, this will come back,"" she said. There was uncomfortable laughter.
On January 26, the senate will hold its next vote on the revisions.
As the faculty senator who effectively silenced the conversation made her way back to her seat, Jasmine Lester glared at her, her middle finger raised in the air. ""This is my whole life,"" Lester said. ""And she just shot it down.""

Jasmine Lester is an Arizona native with ASU roots. She grew up in Ahwatukee, the child of a mother who handles internship programming at the university and a father who is a professor and former dean of humanities in the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Lester's parents aren't affiliated directly with Barrett.
Lester enrolled in the honors college in 2007. Like Jane, she formed a close relationship with a professor, who hasn't returned New Times' request for comment.
New Times is limiting the details of Lester's story because of ongoing legal action.
In conversations with New Times and in her Title IX complaint, Lester says her relationship with the professor took on a dynamic that extended beyond professional boundaries.
In 2010, Lester went to ASU's Office of Equity and Inclusion to discuss the matter with Kamala Green, the office's executive director and ASU's Title IX compliance coordinator.
Green's responsibilities include investigating Title IX violations when a faculty or staff member is the accused.
But Lester says Green didn't see her situation as a violation. ""I was trying to tell her that this is how the power dynamic creates an inherently abusive dynamic or situation,"" Lester says, ""but she didn't understand that. She kept being like, 'You don't know what rape is.'""
Lester says she felt unheard -- silenced, even -- by the school.
A university spokesman says Lester's claims were investigated and that there was no finding of any policy violation on the part of the professor. Green cannot comment on individual cases, but says, ""ASU takes these cases very seriously, and we investigate every one of them as quickly as we possibly can.""
Lester never got the outcome she wanted from ASU, but she funneled her frustration into helping others.
In 2013 -- two years after she graduated -- Lester founded Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, an advocacy group focused on connecting ASU students with the national Title IX movement. Through that work, she began collecting stories of abuse, and by June 2014, she had enough information to file a formal Title IX complaint against ASU. Lester's complaint, which is still under investigation, will be incorporated into the ongoing federal investigation of ASU.
""I know how administrators maintain the status quo,"" Lester says. ""They wait for people to graduate. I didn't leave after I graduated. I stayed bugging them about it for the next three years.""
Lester's complaint focuses on several areas: sexual violence in Greek culture, a lack of resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students on campus, and the culture at Barrett.
The Barrett portion names names. It tells stories of alleged abuse by 11 Barrett professors, many still employees of the school.
Lester's complaint also details the school's response to Jane.
Jane was devastated when Hunter broke off their relationship. She continued to see him on campus, and she says she became depressed to the point of attempting suicide. As time passed -- and after she learned of Lester's work on campus -- Jane says her view of the relationship changed.
""He took advantage of his power over me to coerce me,"" Jane says in an e-mail. ""This wasn't a consensual relationship. It was sexual abuse and it was rape.""
In the testimony she provided for Lester's complaint, Jane says she felt trapped by the need to maintain Hunter as a reference, as well as fear that coming forward would mar her reputation, make her feel unsafe, and harm her relationships with other faculty. So she didn't say anything.
But in March 2014, she broke down and told two Barrett professors about the affair. Without warning her, they reported the situation to Barrett's dean of students. Jane was asked to come in -- against her will -- for a meeting.
In a process she calls ""organized intimidation,"" Jane says she told her story to Barrett's deans, to campus counseling and advocacy offices, and eventually to Kamala Green.
""I was put through the ringer, dragged across campus to people I didn't want to talk to, not provided any university support like a victim's advocate or anything, and victim-blamed either directly or indirectly at every single step,"" she says in an e-mail.
Days after Green and Jane's meeting, Hunter was sent a letter releasing him from all duties, effective immediately.
Barrett's deans called for a meeting of the faculty. A former staff member who wishes to remain unidentified says faculty were told that any additional complaint of abuse by a professor would lead to the dissolution of the signature Human Event course.
Because that seminar distinguishes Barrett from the rest of ASU, its dissolution could mean Barrett faculty no longer would be necessary.
In June, three months after she first filed her complaint, Jane received a final written decision from the university provost, based on the investigation conducted by Green's office. The investigation found that Joel Hunter violated ASU's policy on amorous relationships, as well as the university's code of ethics, by engaging in a sexual relationship with Jane while she was in his class.
Hunter declined to be interviewed, but he did send New Times a brief comment by e-mail.
Hunter confirmed that his contract was not renewed because he violated ACD 402.
But he still speaks highly of Barrett. ""My experience was that it is a great culture with caring, supportive deans and staff, a stellar faculty who are committed to teaching excellence, and the brightest students I've ever had the pleasure to teach,"" he wrote.
Jane currently is a junior at the honors college. ""For the most part, I avoid Barrett,"" she says. ""I just go to classes, and I live off campus now, so it's not as bad. But the thing at Barrett is you always run into people you are trying to avoid. It's this wonderful honors community, where the deans and professors are always out socializing with the students,"" she says with obvious sarcasm.
""There are individually decent people in the administration,"" Jane notes. ""The problem is they can't change anything. There's nothing they can do as individuals to change the overwhelming institutional problems of rape culture and prioritizing the school's reputation over supporting victims.""
The very community that drew Jane to Barrett now is a disappointment to her. She points to the deans' treatment of her; the school's reporting process, which she says was marred by poor communication and missed deadlines; the faculty and staff who have ignored this problem for years; and the students who looked for reasons to blame her.
""They should really be ashamed of themselves,"" she says.

Dr. Eric Susser, an award-winning Barrett professor -- he was both the first non tenure-track recipient of the prestigious Founder's Day Faculty Achievement Award in Teaching and voted ""Hottest Professor"" in The State Press' annual poll on more than one occasion -- also had his contract dropped because of ACD 402 violations.
(New Times Managing Editor Amy Silverman and Susser's ex-wife, Deborah Sussman, have co-taught a local writing workshop for more than a decade.)
On www.ratemyprofessors.com, a national website on which students post anonymous professor reviews, comments show how the intimacy and intensity of the Human Event course can sometimes shift the tone of student-professor relationships down an inappropriate path.
Susser received the following comments from students in his class:
• 9/18/2005: ""Susser understands how to relate to college students. He's very entertaining and engaging. He's incredibly smart and the class is very thought-provoking . . . I loved this class. Plus I sort of had a crush on him.""
• 7/20/2010: ""Dr. Susser is wonderful! Not only did he take a special interest in me, he sought out students who needed extra help  made time for all of us to meet with him 1:1. If you need coaching for your writing or classroom participation, he's the guy to go to. But he's also full of himself. Don't let on that you think he's hot. Play it cool you'll be OK.""
Susser, who taught at Barrett for 15 years, developed and led the college's wildly popular trips to Paris. Like all Barrett professors, Susser pushed his Human Event students to join.
Rumors about inappropriate happenings on those trips swirled for years. A former Barrett staff member who wishes to remain anonymous says she heard students saying they wanted to go on the Paris trip specifically in hopes of sleeping with Susser.
The Paris trips eventually came to a stop, right around the time Susser left the school.
ASU hasn't fulfilled New Times' requests for copies of personnel files, including those of Susser, but Fox 10 News did obtain the records for a September 17 report.
According to documents shown in Fox 10's newscast, Susser's contract was not renewed in 2012 after he admitted to having sexual relationships with three Barrett students.
Susser, who divorced in 2005 and remarried in 2012, hasn't returned multiple requests for comment.
ASU did provide New Times with a July 2012 letter in which Barrett Dean Mark Jacobs notified Susser that he would not receive an annual academic year appointment.
Instead, Susser was offered a ""limited appointment"" for the fall semester only. He was told he would work on curriculum development, as a telecommuter, until his final date of employment on December 21 of that year. He no longer would have office space at Barrett -- he was given two weeks to clear out his personal belongings -- and he was told he no longer would teach or supervise student projects.
The letter doesn't detail why Susser's relationship with the school changed.
Though the university wouldn't share more detailed records with New Times, ASU Police Department records do describe the former professor's behavior.
According to one ASU police report, on the morning of March 31, 2014 -- 15 months after Susser's contract ended -- a staff member at the university's largest library, Hayden, found a brown bag that had been left behind on the second floor.
Inside, she located an ASU identification card with Eric Susser's name on it. She tried to e-mail Susser about the bag, but the e-mail -- likely because Susser no longer was employed by ASU -- didn't transmit.
The staff member continued to look and found more than she expected in the backpack. She contacted ASU's police.
Police listed the impounded bag's contents in their report. In addition to two ASU identification cards, a bill, and a MasterCard all bearing Susser's name, police found ""2 lancets, 3 meth pipes (one with residue), two pill containers (one possibly containing crystal meth), a bag of empty pill capsules, and a prescription bottle made out to Susser which contained various tablets.""
The tablets: ""oxycodone, amphetamine, Viagra,"" and more.
Police initially were unable to contact Susser -- his driver's license was suspended, they wrote in the report -- so the case was marked as pending. Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, says Susser recently was served with a no-trespass order barring him from campus.
But this wasn't Susser's first incident at ASU's libraries, or the ASU Police Department's first hint that the professor might be troubled.
Susser once was the subject of a handwritten field interrogation card, also drafted by ASU's police force. That 2002 document details some of the professor's other alleged extracurricular pursuits.
""Susser was contacted after a 101"" -- in police code, a 101 is a woman in a car -- ""said he exposed himself on the third floor of law library,"" police wrote.
The officer noted that a subject matching Susser's description was involved in a similar incident, in the same location, just two days before.
According to the report, Susser admitted to the officer that he was ""checking out women,"" but he denied having exposed himself.
The officer who wrote the report tells New Times he has no specific recollection of the incident.
But at the time, he clearly knew who Susser was. He listed Susser's ASU affiliation as ""faculty,"" and under employer, he wrote: ""ASU (Honors College).""
Just what happened after ASU police learned that the professor allegedly had flashed students is unclear.
The ASU Police Department says it no longer can find a copy of this document in its files. Kamala Green wasn't aware of the incident, though she wasn't in office at the time, and Mark Johnson, the university spokesman, hasn't provided specific comment on this report. For now, the trail ends at the ASU Police Department, which hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment.
Johnson says he doesn't know whether police notified Barrett or ASU administrators of the incident. ""Under current police department practice, the department would notify senior administrators and the relevant department,"" he says. ""I can't speak to what the practice may have been under the previous police administration.""
But one thing is clear: Susser kept his job for another decade after this report.
It's unknown whether Susser has found employment as a university professor, but he apparently has kept busy since leaving ASU. In June 2014, the Cooking Channel aired an episode of its show Belly Up! -- a kind of Bar Rescue rip-off -- titled ""Hidden Issues."" The episode focused on Susser's latest endeavor: a bar in West Phoenix called The Hideaway West Bar and Grill.
A student commenter on www.ratemyprofessors.com wrote of Susser in 2008: ""Susser is amazing because he lets the discussions go where they will and interjects when he has something important to say. Very intelligent professor, although a little slimy as a person.""

The problem at Barrett admittedly is complex.
Even 18-year-old freshmen are adults capable of giving consent under the law.
But experts tend to agree that stricter policies, such as the one ASU is considering, make more sense. Doctors can't sleep with patients and lawyers can't sleep with clients, so why should professors be able to sleep with their students?
Dr. Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, an expert on young adults, author of Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, says his research supports ""a taboo"" on all faculty-undergraduate relationships.
""It's almost inevitably exploitative,"" he says, ""even if neither side thinks of it that way.""
Arnett coined the term ""emerging adulthood"" to describe the time from 18 to 25 before people take on the full set of adult responsibilities, like career, marriage, and family. His research on emerging adults in many ways reflects common sense: People between these ages look and can act like grownups, but they just aren't equipped to make the greatest decisions.
""People's decision-making abilities are not as developed at 19 or 20 as they will be at 40 or 50,"" Arnett says. ""Do you really want to be 19 and in a class with a professor you like, and your roommate's dating him? That is weird by any standard, and it's disruptive to the central mission of the university, which is to teach young people, to prepare them for adult life.""
Seth Schwartz, a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and the incoming president of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, similarly is concerned.
""It's sort of hard to say no,"" Schwartz says. ""That's the major problem with these relationships between students and faculty: Are you willing to say no to someone who is in a position of authority over you?""

Dr. David Bruce Conz died with his pants around his ankles.
Conz, 39, was open with the university about a relationship he'd formed with a former student. But his tale took a tragic turn.
His autopsy report lays out what happened:
""Cause of death: gunshot wound to head and brain.""
""Manner: suicide.""
Under ""Diagnoses and Significant Findings,"" the medical examiner lists ""history of depression over work situation.""
Friends and family didn't see it coming.
Conz was a two-time ASU alum, and he began teaching at the school in 2005. A dedicated home brewer, Conz was nicknamed ""Professor Beer"" and led a popular ASU course in which students developed their own concoctions.
Conz formed a relationship with a Barrett freshman who recently had completed his Human Event course. Soon after, he shot himself in the mouth.
Rebekah Hollenberg was Conz's long-term girlfriend. The two met while swing dancing downtown, and they had been together for two and a half years at the time of his death.
""He studied do-it-yourself things, and he would make his own biodiesel and raise his own chickens,"" Hollenberg says. ""He was brilliant in so many ways.""
Conz and Hollenberg were polyamorous -- they were open with each other about dating other people -- and in late December 2012, Conz told Hollenberg that he was seeing a former student.
""The type of relationship we had is sort of unconventional and hard for people to understand,"" Hollenberg says. ""I was supportive of [the student] and Dave's relationship. I made them dinner. I gave them gifts. I wanted to make them happy.""
The former student asks not to be identified and declined to be interviewed for this story, but much of her tale is revealed in a detailed police report on Conz's death.
Around February 2013, Conz told Hollenberg he was called into a meeting at Barrett to discuss the relationship, ""a kind of review to see that everything was above board,"" she says.
Conz told Hollenberg that they were given the all-clear. The student no longer was in his class, so the relationship wasn't in violation of ASU policy.
Regardless, Conz began worrying about his job security after the meeting. He was scheduled for a formal contract renewal review later in the spring, and because Barrett doesn't offer its professors tenure, the meetings always made him nervous.
And then, the police report says, Conz accidentally received an e-mail that was about him but not for him, one that referenced an upcoming meeting of the deans to discuss his relationship with the student.
At his April 3 review, Conz was told that his contract wouldn't be renewed.
""It was just a shock for him,"" Hollenberg says. ""They told him that it was okay.""
The student later would tell police that Conz was terminated after it was reported to a Barrett dean that he had given her alcohol. Under state law and current ASU policy, it's more problematic for a professor to hand an underage student a beer than it is for him to sleep with her.
After his firing, Conz spiraled. ""He was kind of acting like his life was over,"" Hollenberg says. ""That was his identity, and it was sort of just taken so suddenly.""
She says she and Conz discussed their options -- moving to Vancouver, working full-time on DIY projects -- ""but he just wasn't able to get that vision yet,"" she says. ""And he was worried that if they put something in his record that seemed derogatory, he would never get another professorship anyway.""
Conz began drinking heavily.
Five days after he was fired, on April 8, 2013, Hollenberg became worried when Conz didn't pick her up for a date they had planned. She called him, and he sounded drunk. So she went to his house.
Meanwhile, the student told police that she had arrived at Conz's house about 5 that evening. She found him in bed, drunk, next to two bottles of Black Velvet Whisky -- one empty, the other half full -- and a loaded .38-caliber revolver at his side.
The student hid the revolver in a closet and called Conz's ex-wife, a psychiatrist. While they were on the phone, Conz ran from the house.
Hollenberg arrived about 5:30 and met Conz and the student in the driveway, where the student told her what was happening.
At 5:59, the student called police, who told her to keep Conz out of the house, away from the guns. When Conz tried to go inside, she tackled him.
Hollenberg told police that a full-fledged fight ensued, with the student and her former professor punching and kicking each other. She says Conz called the student ""cunt,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole.""
The student told police that Conz told her ""it was her fault, that she got him fired.""
Finally, Conz broke free, yelling at the student: ""You caused this.""
He ran into the house and locked the women out. They got inside using a spare key, and almost immediately they heard gunshots coming from the locked hallway bathroom. The first shot blasted through the door, passing just above the student's head. Seven seconds later, a second shot entered Conz's mouth.
Police found Conz seated on the toilet, his pants pulled down. The bathroom floor and wall were splattered with blood, and a silver revolver was on the floor. A bullet had exited through the top of Conz's skull.
Conz was conscious on the way to the hospital -- he admitted to paramedics that he'd shot himself -- but he was listed in critical condition upon arrival.
Hollenberg visited Conz frequently. Though he was unconscious, she sang to him, read to him, and talked to him.
Conz's mother removed him from life support on April 12, and he died later that day.
Months after his death, Conz's mother gave police a note she found on a torn piece of paper in his home. It's not clear who it was intended for, but police found the note significant enough to include in their report.
""Your love blossoms within me,"" Conz wrote. ""Like a parasite to liberate or embrace you I must die.""
Throughout his autopsy and the lengthy police report, Conz's job loss -- consistently tied to his relationship with the student -- is named as a key contributing factor in his suicide. In the course of their investigation, police even interviewed Frederick Corey, the dean who had let Conz go. Corey did not return requests for comment on Conz's case.
The student later provided testimony for Jasmine Lester's Title IX complaint. In it, she says she saw her relationship with Conz as above board. She'd even introduced him to her parents.
""The relationship was highly pleasurable and showed no outward signs of abuse besides the innate power imbalance that resides within a 20-year age gap,"" she wrote.
""He was loved by many, and still is.""
The student took off three semesters after Conz's death. She no longer speaks to Hollenberg, who moved to Illinois.
Never in her testimony does the student say she regrets dating Conz. Instead, she takes aim at ASU's rules on such relationships.
""We continued the relationship,"" she writes, ""because we realized ASU had no policy regarding faculty-student relationships as long as the student is no longer in the professor's class.""

http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/barrett-the-honors-college-at-asu-is-a-close-knit-community-some-say-too-close-6633269,"
One morning last spring, Becca Smouse, a first-year student at Arizona State University's Barrett, The Honors College, jumped in her car and headed to Tempe for her intensive freshman seminar course, the Human Event.
The Human Event in many ways is the linchpin of Barrett's programming. It covers an ambitious topic -- the history of human ideas -- and is designed to challenge how students think through intensive reading, writing, and discussion.
Through the Human Event class and subsequent study-abroad trips, Barrett students begin to form the strong relationships with professors they will need as they move on to become teaching assistants and interns, to seek supervisors for their honors theses, and to apply for graduate school and jobs. The class is important, and so are the relationships it helps students to form.
But that March day, Smouse and her classmates found an unexpected note on their classroom door. It informed them that their professor, Dr. Joel Hunter, wouldn't make it in that day, or for the rest of the week. 

Smouse found the message odd, especially because Hunter usually was very communicative and it was unlike him to let students come all the way to campus just to find out that class was canceled. ""Why didn't he just e-mail us?"" she wondered.
Turns out, Dr. Hunter was never coming back.
A substitute arrived the next week, and students were told that Hunter wouldn't return that semester. Smouse says she and other students were worried about him at first.
Then, rumors began to swirl. Jokes about Hunter getting fired for sleeping with a student soon turned into campus-wide gossip.
But Barrett's administration remained silent. Smouse says she was disappointed in the lack of transparency, especially given the tight-knit nature of the school.
And she began to hear another rumor: This wasn't the first time something like this had happened at Barrett.
When an anonymously written blog post confirmed the gossip about Hunter, Smouse, a young journalist in training, responded the only way she knew how. She wrote about it, in an April 14 opinion piece for ASU's campus newspaper, The State Press.
""Unfortunately, the professor's controversial dismissal seems to have been left largely untouched by Barrett administration,"" she wrote. ""Rumors buzzing and parental concerns rising, the spotlight is shining brightly on the college's lack of acknowledgement. Many also see firing the professor as a cop-out, simply sweeping the problem under the rug of Barrett embarrassments. By cutting out the professor, it seems the college hoped to avoid confronting the situation all together.""
Turns out, sweeping Barrett's troubles under the rug hasn't been so easy.

One of Rebecca Smouse's Barrett classmates, Jane -- who asked to not be identified by her real name -- also was disappointed in the school's response.
But Jane wasn't just a student in Joel Hunter's class. She also was his lover.
In an April 10 blog post for a website called Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, Jane laid out details about her relationship with Hunter, the process of reporting him to the school, and his subsequent dismissal.
In the first 72 hours after her post was published, an attached petition calling on Barrett's dean to fire predatory professors collected more than 400 signatures.
""For the past 15 years, ASU's Barrett Honors College has been home to professors who sexually harass and sexually abuse students,"" the petition says. ""While romantic relationships between professors and students may seem consensual, the imbalance of power makes these relationships inherently coercive and abusive.""
Today, the petition has more than 1,000 signatures.
Jane's story is not unique.
In the past few years, Barrett has terminated the contracts of at least three professors who engaged in sexual relationships with students. Joel Hunter and Dr. Eric Susser were told their contracts were not being renewed after they admitted to violating ASU's student-professor relationship policies, and Dr. David Conz committed suicide after his contract was dropped when a student reported he'd given alcohol to the Barrett freshman he was dating. Police records, documents given to New Times by involved students, and reports by other media outlets confirm the terminations.
But some say the number of Barrett faculty members skirting the rules -- and whose contracts may have been dropped -- actually is far higher.
Barrett administrators aren't talking, but Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, replied on their behalf. ""Such relationships are inappropriate and do not comport with how we expect members of the faculty and lecturers to behave,"" Johnson says, ""and when such relationships are brought to our attention, appropriate steps are taken.""
In a three-month investigation of the issues at Barrett, New Times interviewed former and current Barrett students and staff and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal university documents, written student testimonials provided to the government in a formal complaint, and police reports.
ASU president Michael Crow did not respond to an interview request. Many of New Times' public records requests -- asking for everything from personnel files to police reports on these and other cases -- went largely ignored or unfilled. Much is still unknown.
But one thing is clear: Inappropriate student-professor relationships at Barrett have been a poorly kept secret for years.
ASU has, in fact, had its share of troubles when it comes to sex.
In May 2014, just a few weeks after Jane's blog post was published, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights made an unprecedented move: It announced the names of all schools being investigated for possible violations of Title IX, the federal legislation dictating how sexual violence and harassment complaints should be handled at schools that receive federal funding.
ASU was on the list of 55 schools. A Department of Education spokesman says the Office for Civil Rights is still investigating the university, but he did not provide further details.
For the most part, the problems at ASU have been linked to two worlds where these issues are better known: fraternities and athletics. ASU previously settled federal lawsuits dealing with the university's responses to two alleged sexual assaults, one involving a football player and the other a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
But a Title IX complaint filed in June 2014 by Jasmine Lester, a former Barrett student, asks the Office for Civil Rights to focus on a different sexual abuse problem on campus: that of professors sleeping with their undergraduate students.
At Barrett, and across all of ASU, professor-student relationships are banned in certain contexts, like when a student is currently in a professor's class or when a professor is supervising a student's thesis. But this policy still allows room for involvement between professors and students.
And particularly at Barrett, which educates more than 5,000 of ASU's nearly 60,000 undergraduates, there have been repeated issues with professors skirting -- sometimes, even defying -- the rules.
Prestigious universities across the nation have drawn much harder lines in regard to such relationships. In 2010, Yale University banned faculty members from forming relationships with any undergraduate students, noting in its updated policy that undergrads ""are particularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship."" In 2013, the University of Connecticut implemented a similar ban.
Last fall, ASU's faculty senate debated whether to replace its own policy with an outright ban on professor-undergraduate relationships.
At a senate meeting in November, Cynthia Tompkins, chair of the committee drafting the proposed policy changes, referenced the scope of ASU's problem. She said at least 20 faculty members across ASU have been dismissed for having inappropriate sexual relationships with students in recent years.
ASU hasn't provided the exact number of dismissals stemming from Barrett or elsewhere. ""We do not keep a running tally of faculty who are disciplined for [relationship policy] violations,"" a spokesman says. A representative from the university office charged with investigating these policy violations wouldn't comment on how many investigations she has conducted.
But when ASU was named on the list of schools under federal review, Michael Crow did speak to The State Press' editorial board, and he addressed the problem at Barrett.
Student journalist Nicholas Palomino Mendoza reported on May 7, 2014, that Crow said he was aware of ""reports of inappropriate sexual conduct between Barrett faculty and students.""
""If it's consensual in a sense of the way that the law looks at things,"" Mendoza quotes Crow as saying, ""then it is inappropriate from the perspective of how we expect our faculty members or our instructors to behave.""
""There have been professors in relationships with students, and when we find out about it, they are all fired,"" Crow told the paper.
The revisions to ASU's professor-undergraduate relationship policy would aim to switch the school's focus from reactive to proactive, and from firing violators to improving the culture around these relationships on the front end.
At the first reading of the proposed revisions in early October, Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, made clear what the policy changes would mean.
""To put it rather bluntly,"" she said, ""ASU students are not part of your dating pool.""

Barrett, the Honors College, is a school within a school.
Admissions documents say Barrett consists of ""living-learning communities"" of academically driven students from across ASU's four campuses. Barrett is where the cream of the ASU crop goes to be educated.
Barrett marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. The University Honors College was granted official status in 1988, when it became the first residential honors college in the nation. It was renamed for former Intel CEO Craig Barrett and his wife, Barbara, a former ambassador to Finland and Arizona gubernatorial candidate, after they endowed the school with a $10 million gift in 2000. The college has undergone great growth in recent years, with its current student body size rivaling its alumni population.
In its admissions literature, Barrett distinguishes itself from the wider university. Though the majority of ASU students were in the top 25 percent of their graduating high school classes, for example, most Barrett students were in the top 10 percent. One year, students donned T-shirts that read ""_arrett, the Honors College. We don't get B's.""
All of Barrett's honors faculty fellows hold Ph.D.s, and the school boasts a 15-to-1 student-faculty ratio, small in comparison to ASU's ratio of 22-to-1. Students, sometimes called ""The Commas"" in a reference to the school's stuffy title, almost universally refer to Barrett as tight-knit.
The college's largest campus is at the corner of Apache Boulevard and Rural Road in Tempe, neatly tucked behind a set of iron gates on ASU's central campus. The Barrett campus is fully enclosed, and were it not for some classes they take elsewhere, Barrett students practically could spend their college lives there. Students are, in fact, expected to live on campus for at least their first two years.
Barrett's central campus is reminiscent of the exclusive private schools Barrett emulates. It's got everything but the ivy and, indeed, references to the Ivy League (Harvard of the Southwest, anyone?) are not uncommon. Some students jokingly refer to the campus as ""The Nerd Cage.""
Outside, students gather in groups and study in solitude on the sandstone benches surrounding Barrett's green lawns. There's an outdoor fireplace for cold-weather gatherings and a volleyball pit.
Inside, Barrett's buildings serve multiple purposes, reflecting the insular nature of the Barrett community. One can find professors' offices, student dorms, and classrooms interspersed throughout any given structure.
In the Honors Hall -- in many ways, the hub of Barrett life -- there's a gym with flat-screen TVs and elliptical machines, a spiral staircase leading downstairs to a coffee shop, and a recreational area with ping-pong tables.
There's also the beautiful Refectory, or, as students call it in a reference to Harry Potter's Hogwarts, the Great Hall. On a Friday afternoon in December, one student casually played the grand piano as others sat at long tables with high-backed chairs and feasted in the hall's wood-paneled dining room.
In an adjacent hallway, photographs of Barrett students who went on to win prestigious fellowships line the walls: 185 Fulbright scholars, 52 Marshall scholars, 54 Goldwater scholars. The list goes on.
Barrett students major in any field they choose, taking classes in the disciplinary college of their choice. One student says there can be tension between Barrett and the rest of ASU, in part because of the special privileges afforded to Barrett students. Barrett students get to register for classes before others, for example, and sometimes are offered special courses the general ASU population can't take.
This includes the Human Event, a mandatory two-semester seminar taken during freshmen year.
Barrett freshmen may take a different professor for each semester of the intensive course, but they are encouraged to stick with one. They also are encouraged to participate in for-credit, study-abroad trips with their professors during the summer after the course finishes.
The Human Event is ""a wonderful course to get students into the idea of working closely with a professor,"" says a former staff member who asked to not be identified. But she says she also believes the class has contributed to the problem of too-close professor-student relations.
""Because it was so friendly,"" she says, ""if you had any faculty members who were not terribly ethical in how they related to youngsters, it was a situation in which they could take advantage.""
With these professors, sources tell New Times, office hours turn into intimate meetings. Examination of the ancient Greeks may have an odd focus on the sexual relationships between mentors and mentees. Trips abroad are fueled more by alcohol than by learning.
To many, Barrett's very structure, intended to create a close learning community for students and professors alike, has instead become something sinister: a way for predatory teachers to grow close to -- sometimes, even sexually -- the young and ambitious students in their tutelage.

Jane first was drawn to Barrett because of its strong sense of community. She enrolled in the school in 2012.
Her story unfolds in her blog post, interviews and e-mails with New Times, and a pile of documents she provided to the government in a Title IX complaint against ASU. The documents include Jane's personal e-mails and text messages as well as copies of e-mails she received from ASU detailing the investigation into and eventual dismissal of Dr. Joel Hunter.
Hunter, a Barrett faculty member since 2008, admitted to the university and to New Times that he violated ASU's professor-undergraduate relationships policy before his contract was dropped.
On his personal website, Hunter lists the many awards he won during his time at Barrett, including accolades for teaching excellence, academic service, and faculty mentoring.
Since he left the school, Hunter also has posted a lengthy student tutorial on how to succeed in Barrett's difficult freshmen seminar course. ""It is best to err on the side of formality,"" he wrote in a late September post focused on how to best communicate with one's Human Event professor. These professors are ""incredibly friendly and funny, yes,"" he writes, ""but they are not in your peer group.""
It seems hindsight is 20/20.
By the end of Jane's fall semester in Hunter's Human Event class, she and the professor had grown close.
In December 2012, Hunter e-mailed Jane, asking her to interrupt a meeting so it wouldn't drag on. ""Plus, I would get to see one of my favorite Human Event students twice in one day,"" he wrote.
Jane signed up to take Hunter's class again in the spring.
By January 2013, the two began getting together regularly for meetings and meals. Soon, they were texting, and by early February, their texts hinted at a sexual relationship.
Some texts reference a trip the two took to a local park, where Jane says Hunter provided her with alcohol and massaged her, suggesting that doing so would be easier if she didn't have clothes on. They spent the afternoon kissing.
A few weeks later, Hunter texted Jane about 2 a.m. from a Harry Potter conference he was attending in Albuquerque:
Joel: get your ass to albuquerque now dammit. I just closed down the hotel bar with a harry potter student of mine who will not, i'm sure of it, sleep with me. All alone am i . . .
Jane alleges that Hunter shared with her sexual fantasies about other Human Event students and said he'd fallen in love with a student before.
The two went on to have a covert sexual relationship -- aside from the clear violation of policy, Hunter was married with children -- having sex in cars, in Hunter's office, and in parking garages around campus. Jane says Hunter gave her extensions on schoolwork because of their relationship.
In their talks, interspersed with innuendo, was conversation about Jane's future.
Texts from the day after their trip to the park:
Jane: How is my letter of recommendation coming? :)
Joel: It'll be done this afternoon.
And an hour later:
Joel: Letter submitted electronically. They won't be able to give you the scholarship quickly enough . . .
Jane: You mean I don't get to read it? Noooooooooooooo
Joel: I'll share it with you later. It's totally hot.
Then, in April of Jane's freshman year, Barrett Professor David Conz committed suicide shortly after his teaching contract was dropped. Conz's dismissal was linked to a relationship with one of his Human Event students. Jane says Hunter made out Conz to be the victim of an unfair administration and began expressing fears about losing his own job.
A text conversation in the days that followed:
Jane: I know you didn't want a hug, but are you ok? I don't think I've ever seen you look so sad.
Joel: Im ok. Shook up, sad and feeling vulnerable. Life. 
In May 2013, Jane and Hunter had sexual intercourse in a motel.
The spring semester came to a close, and Jane fully expected that she and Hunter would resume their relationship when she returned for her sophomore year. The two even texted occasionally during the summer.
But when Jane returned to campus in August, she says, Hunter told her he'd learned that their affair was risky after a discussion at a Barrett faculty retreat. He abruptly broke off the relationship.
""One thing my professor said to me when he ended this affair still sticks out to me,"" Jane wrote in the closing of her Title IX complaint testimony. ""He had no idea that what he was doing was wrong or even against the rules, because it was so common for Barrett Honors College professors to be involved with students that all of the honors faculty saw it as normal.""
Hunter declined to be interviewed, and New Times isn't aware of what he is up to today. On his personal website, he says he is a married father of three.

On a Monday afternoon in early November, Arizona State University's faculty senate gathered to discuss, among other things, a motion to revise the Academic Affairs Manual (ACD) policy governing ""amorous relationships"" between professors and students. That policy, ACD 402, has been on the books since 1982.
In Tempe's Education Lecture Hall, a single observer watched from a seat toward the back. Jasmine Lester, a 2011 Barrett grad, is a small woman with curly brown hair. She wears glasses and looks younger than her 25 years.
Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, first laid out some ground rules. She asked senate members to refrain from dominating, and she made clear just who was invited to discuss this motion.
""Observers are welcome to observe as much as you want,"" she said. ""But be like children. You may be seen but not heard.""
For many years, ASU's amorous relationships guidelines fell under the university's sexual harassment policy. But in 2011, they were parsed to create a policy focused exclusively on consensual romantic or sexual student-professor relationships.
As written today, ACD 402 bans ASU employees from making key decisions -- grading, hiring, disciplining, or offering recommendations -- over anyone with whom they are in a sexual relationship. The policy bans faculty members from engaging in relationships with any students currently enrolled in their classes, and it says violations can result in disciplinary action up to termination.
But in 2014, the senate began considering revisions to ACD 402 that would give the policy much greater reach, banning all relationships between ASU faculty and undergraduate students.
If approved, the revisions would require faculty members to report any such relationships to a supervisor immediately, with policy exemptions made on a case-by-case basis.
""Our current policies regarding faculty-student relationships are inadequate as written,"" university spokesman Mark Johnson tells New Times. ""The faculty senate should be applauded for taking steps to strengthen those policies to ensure that faculty members and lecturers have only professional relationships with students.""
That November day, Cynthia Tompkins, who chaired the policy-revision task force, addressed the faculty senate. During the month-long comment period that preceded this meeting, she explained, many seemed to think the proposed revisions had come out of left field.
Tompkins acknowledged that professor-student relationships historically have had a wide range of acceptability -- you hear stories of professor-student couples that happily marry, she noted -- but she said many unacceptable versions have taken place at ASU in recent years.
In addition to the 20 firings mentioned above, Tompkins said, ASU has had at least one unwanted student-professor pregnancy this year.
The intent of the policy revisions, she said, is to put students back at the center of focus.
The floor was opened for discussion. Faculty members approached the microphone to raise questions and concerns.
Many were worried about the scope of the revised language. ASU is a big school. Would professors need to start IDing everyone they meet in Tempe?
The new language doesn't make clear just which relationships would be exempt. What about pre-existing ones? And what would happen if a professor reports a relationship and doesn't get an exemption?
""You really think about whether you want that relationship,"" Ossipov answered. ""One person would have to leave the university.""
Tensions rose.
""I want to be blunt. I think this policy is very invasive,"" a female faculty member said. ""Every amorous relationship is not a 40-year-old faculty member and an 18-year-old-student.""
Concerns were raised about privacy and the motion's intrusiveness and scope.
Finally, a frustrated female senator in the back of the auditorium walked up to the microphone and moved to vote down the controversial motion.
Twenty senators voted in favor of the policy revision. One abstained from voting.
And with 62 votes against the changes, the motion was -- for the time being, at least -- dead.
Ossipov said the motion would be returned to Tompkins' committee for further revisions. ""However, this will come back,"" she said. There was uncomfortable laughter.
On January 26, the senate will hold its next vote on the revisions.
As the faculty senator who effectively silenced the conversation made her way back to her seat, Jasmine Lester glared at her, her middle finger raised in the air. ""This is my whole life,"" Lester said. ""And she just shot it down.""

Jasmine Lester is an Arizona native with ASU roots. She grew up in Ahwatukee, the child of a mother who handles internship programming at the university and a father who is a professor and former dean of humanities in the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Lester's parents aren't affiliated directly with Barrett.
Lester enrolled in the honors college in 2007. Like Jane, she formed a close relationship with a professor, who hasn't returned New Times' request for comment.
New Times is limiting the details of Lester's story because of ongoing legal action.
In conversations with New Times and in her Title IX complaint, Lester says her relationship with the professor took on a dynamic that extended beyond professional boundaries.
In 2010, Lester went to ASU's Office of Equity and Inclusion to discuss the matter with Kamala Green, the office's executive director and ASU's Title IX compliance coordinator.
Green's responsibilities include investigating Title IX violations when a faculty or staff member is the accused.
But Lester says Green didn't see her situation as a violation. ""I was trying to tell her that this is how the power dynamic creates an inherently abusive dynamic or situation,"" Lester says, ""but she didn't understand that. She kept being like, 'You don't know what rape is.'""
Lester says she felt unheard -- silenced, even -- by the school.
A university spokesman says Lester's claims were investigated and that there was no finding of any policy violation on the part of the professor. Green cannot comment on individual cases, but says, ""ASU takes these cases very seriously, and we investigate every one of them as quickly as we possibly can.""
Lester never got the outcome she wanted from ASU, but she funneled her frustration into helping others.
In 2013 -- two years after she graduated -- Lester founded Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, an advocacy group focused on connecting ASU students with the national Title IX movement. Through that work, she began collecting stories of abuse, and by June 2014, she had enough information to file a formal Title IX complaint against ASU. Lester's complaint, which is still under investigation, will be incorporated into the ongoing federal investigation of ASU.
""I know how administrators maintain the status quo,"" Lester says. ""They wait for people to graduate. I didn't leave after I graduated. I stayed bugging them about it for the next three years.""
Lester's complaint focuses on several areas: sexual violence in Greek culture, a lack of resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students on campus, and the culture at Barrett.
The Barrett portion names names. It tells stories of alleged abuse by 11 Barrett professors, many still employees of the school.
Lester's complaint also details the school's response to Jane.
Jane was devastated when Hunter broke off their relationship. She continued to see him on campus, and she says she became depressed to the point of attempting suicide. As time passed -- and after she learned of Lester's work on campus -- Jane says her view of the relationship changed.
""He took advantage of his power over me to coerce me,"" Jane says in an e-mail. ""This wasn't a consensual relationship. It was sexual abuse and it was rape.""
In the testimony she provided for Lester's complaint, Jane says she felt trapped by the need to maintain Hunter as a reference, as well as fear that coming forward would mar her reputation, make her feel unsafe, and harm her relationships with other faculty. So she didn't say anything.
But in March 2014, she broke down and told two Barrett professors about the affair. Without warning her, they reported the situation to Barrett's dean of students. Jane was asked to come in -- against her will -- for a meeting.
In a process she calls ""organized intimidation,"" Jane says she told her story to Barrett's deans, to campus counseling and advocacy offices, and eventually to Kamala Green.
""I was put through the ringer, dragged across campus to people I didn't want to talk to, not provided any university support like a victim's advocate or anything, and victim-blamed either directly or indirectly at every single step,"" she says in an e-mail.
Days after Green and Jane's meeting, Hunter was sent a letter releasing him from all duties, effective immediately.
Barrett's deans called for a meeting of the faculty. A former staff member who wishes to remain unidentified says faculty were told that any additional complaint of abuse by a professor would lead to the dissolution of the signature Human Event course.
Because that seminar distinguishes Barrett from the rest of ASU, its dissolution could mean Barrett faculty no longer would be necessary.
In June, three months after she first filed her complaint, Jane received a final written decision from the university provost, based on the investigation conducted by Green's office. The investigation found that Joel Hunter violated ASU's policy on amorous relationships, as well as the university's code of ethics, by engaging in a sexual relationship with Jane while she was in his class.
Hunter declined to be interviewed, but he did send New Times a brief comment by e-mail.
Hunter confirmed that his contract was not renewed because he violated ACD 402.
But he still speaks highly of Barrett. ""My experience was that it is a great culture with caring, supportive deans and staff, a stellar faculty who are committed to teaching excellence, and the brightest students I've ever had the pleasure to teach,"" he wrote.
Jane currently is a junior at the honors college. ""For the most part, I avoid Barrett,"" she says. ""I just go to classes, and I live off campus now, so it's not as bad. But the thing at Barrett is you always run into people you are trying to avoid. It's this wonderful honors community, where the deans and professors are always out socializing with the students,"" she says with obvious sarcasm.
""There are individually decent people in the administration,"" Jane notes. ""The problem is they can't change anything. There's nothing they can do as individuals to change the overwhelming institutional problems of rape culture and prioritizing the school's reputation over supporting victims.""
The very community that drew Jane to Barrett now is a disappointment to her. She points to the deans' treatment of her; the school's reporting process, which she says was marred by poor communication and missed deadlines; the faculty and staff who have ignored this problem for years; and the students who looked for reasons to blame her.
""They should really be ashamed of themselves,"" she says.

Dr. Eric Susser, an award-winning Barrett professor -- he was both the first non tenure-track recipient of the prestigious Founder's Day Faculty Achievement Award in Teaching and voted ""Hottest Professor"" in The State Press' annual poll on more than one occasion -- also had his contract dropped because of ACD 402 violations.
(New Times Managing Editor Amy Silverman and Susser's ex-wife, Deborah Sussman, have co-taught a local writing workshop for more than a decade.)
On www.ratemyprofessors.com, a national website on which students post anonymous professor reviews, comments show how the intimacy and intensity of the Human Event course can sometimes shift the tone of student-professor relationships down an inappropriate path.
Susser received the following comments from students in his class:
• 9/18/2005: ""Susser understands how to relate to college students. He's very entertaining and engaging. He's incredibly smart and the class is very thought-provoking . . . I loved this class. Plus I sort of had a crush on him.""
• 7/20/2010: ""Dr. Susser is wonderful! Not only did he take a special interest in me, he sought out students who needed extra help  made time for all of us to meet with him 1:1. If you need coaching for your writing or classroom participation, he's the guy to go to. But he's also full of himself. Don't let on that you think he's hot. Play it cool you'll be OK.""
Susser, who taught at Barrett for 15 years, developed and led the college's wildly popular trips to Paris. Like all Barrett professors, Susser pushed his Human Event students to join.
Rumors about inappropriate happenings on those trips swirled for years. A former Barrett staff member who wishes to remain anonymous says she heard students saying they wanted to go on the Paris trip specifically in hopes of sleeping with Susser.
The Paris trips eventually came to a stop, right around the time Susser left the school.
ASU hasn't fulfilled New Times' requests for copies of personnel files, including those of Susser, but Fox 10 News did obtain the records for a September 17 report.
According to documents shown in Fox 10's newscast, Susser's contract was not renewed in 2012 after he admitted to having sexual relationships with three Barrett students.
Susser, who divorced in 2005 and remarried in 2012, hasn't returned multiple requests for comment.
ASU did provide New Times with a July 2012 letter in which Barrett Dean Mark Jacobs notified Susser that he would not receive an annual academic year appointment.
Instead, Susser was offered a ""limited appointment"" for the fall semester only. He was told he would work on curriculum development, as a telecommuter, until his final date of employment on December 21 of that year. He no longer would have office space at Barrett -- he was given two weeks to clear out his personal belongings -- and he was told he no longer would teach or supervise student projects.
The letter doesn't detail why Susser's relationship with the school changed.
Though the university wouldn't share more detailed records with New Times, ASU Police Department records do describe the former professor's behavior.
According to one ASU police report, on the morning of March 31, 2014 -- 15 months after Susser's contract ended -- a staff member at the university's largest library, Hayden, found a brown bag that had been left behind on the second floor.
Inside, she located an ASU identification card with Eric Susser's name on it. She tried to e-mail Susser about the bag, but the e-mail -- likely because Susser no longer was employed by ASU -- didn't transmit.
The staff member continued to look and found more than she expected in the backpack. She contacted ASU's police.
Police listed the impounded bag's contents in their report. In addition to two ASU identification cards, a bill, and a MasterCard all bearing Susser's name, police found ""2 lancets, 3 meth pipes (one with residue), two pill containers (one possibly containing crystal meth), a bag of empty pill capsules, and a prescription bottle made out to Susser which contained various tablets.""
The tablets: ""oxycodone, amphetamine, Viagra,"" and more.
Police initially were unable to contact Susser -- his driver's license was suspended, they wrote in the report -- so the case was marked as pending. Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, says Susser recently was served with a no-trespass order barring him from campus.
But this wasn't Susser's first incident at ASU's libraries, or the ASU Police Department's first hint that the professor might be troubled.
Susser once was the subject of a handwritten field interrogation card, also drafted by ASU's police force. That 2002 document details some of the professor's other alleged extracurricular pursuits.
""Susser was contacted after a 101"" -- in police code, a 101 is a woman in a car -- ""said he exposed himself on the third floor of law library,"" police wrote.
The officer noted that a subject matching Susser's description was involved in a similar incident, in the same location, just two days before.
According to the report, Susser admitted to the officer that he was ""checking out women,"" but he denied having exposed himself.
The officer who wrote the report tells New Times he has no specific recollection of the incident.
But at the time, he clearly knew who Susser was. He listed Susser's ASU affiliation as ""faculty,"" and under employer, he wrote: ""ASU (Honors College).""
Just what happened after ASU police learned that the professor allegedly had flashed students is unclear.
The ASU Police Department says it no longer can find a copy of this document in its files. Kamala Green wasn't aware of the incident, though she wasn't in office at the time, and Mark Johnson, the university spokesman, hasn't provided specific comment on this report. For now, the trail ends at the ASU Police Department, which hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment.
Johnson says he doesn't know whether police notified Barrett or ASU administrators of the incident. ""Under current police department practice, the department would notify senior administrators and the relevant department,"" he says. ""I can't speak to what the practice may have been under the previous police administration.""
But one thing is clear: Susser kept his job for another decade after this report.
It's unknown whether Susser has found employment as a university professor, but he apparently has kept busy since leaving ASU. In June 2014, the Cooking Channel aired an episode of its show Belly Up! -- a kind of Bar Rescue rip-off -- titled ""Hidden Issues."" The episode focused on Susser's latest endeavor: a bar in West Phoenix called The Hideaway West Bar and Grill.
A student commenter on www.ratemyprofessors.com wrote of Susser in 2008: ""Susser is amazing because he lets the discussions go where they will and interjects when he has something important to say. Very intelligent professor, although a little slimy as a person.""

The problem at Barrett admittedly is complex.
Even 18-year-old freshmen are adults capable of giving consent under the law.
But experts tend to agree that stricter policies, such as the one ASU is considering, make more sense. Doctors can't sleep with patients and lawyers can't sleep with clients, so why should professors be able to sleep with their students?
Dr. Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, an expert on young adults, author of Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, says his research supports ""a taboo"" on all faculty-undergraduate relationships.
""It's almost inevitably exploitative,"" he says, ""even if neither side thinks of it that way.""
Arnett coined the term ""emerging adulthood"" to describe the time from 18 to 25 before people take on the full set of adult responsibilities, like career, marriage, and family. His research on emerging adults in many ways reflects common sense: People between these ages look and can act like grownups, but they just aren't equipped to make the greatest decisions.
""People's decision-making abilities are not as developed at 19 or 20 as they will be at 40 or 50,"" Arnett says. ""Do you really want to be 19 and in a class with a professor you like, and your roommate's dating him? That is weird by any standard, and it's disruptive to the central mission of the university, which is to teach young people, to prepare them for adult life.""
Seth Schwartz, a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and the incoming president of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, similarly is concerned.
""It's sort of hard to say no,"" Schwartz says. ""That's the major problem with these relationships between students and faculty: Are you willing to say no to someone who is in a position of authority over you?""

Dr. David Bruce Conz died with his pants around his ankles.
Conz, 39, was open with the university about a relationship he'd formed with a former student. But his tale took a tragic turn.
His autopsy report lays out what happened:
""Cause of death: gunshot wound to head and brain.""
""Manner: suicide.""
Under ""Diagnoses and Significant Findings,"" the medical examiner lists ""history of depression over work situation.""
Friends and family didn't see it coming.
Conz was a two-time ASU alum, and he began teaching at the school in 2005. A dedicated home brewer, Conz was nicknamed ""Professor Beer"" and led a popular ASU course in which students developed their own concoctions.
Conz formed a relationship with a Barrett freshman who recently had completed his Human Event course. Soon after, he shot himself in the mouth.
Rebekah Hollenberg was Conz's long-term girlfriend. The two met while swing dancing downtown, and they had been together for two and a half years at the time of his death.
""He studied do-it-yourself things, and he would make his own biodiesel and raise his own chickens,"" Hollenberg says. ""He was brilliant in so many ways.""
Conz and Hollenberg were polyamorous -- they were open with each other about dating other people -- and in late December 2012, Conz told Hollenberg that he was seeing a former student.
""The type of relationship we had is sort of unconventional and hard for people to understand,"" Hollenberg says. ""I was supportive of [the student] and Dave's relationship. I made them dinner. I gave them gifts. I wanted to make them happy.""
The former student asks not to be identified and declined to be interviewed for this story, but much of her tale is revealed in a detailed police report on Conz's death.
Around February 2013, Conz told Hollenberg he was called into a meeting at Barrett to discuss the relationship, ""a kind of review to see that everything was above board,"" she says.
Conz told Hollenberg that they were given the all-clear. The student no longer was in his class, so the relationship wasn't in violation of ASU policy.
Regardless, Conz began worrying about his job security after the meeting. He was scheduled for a formal contract renewal review later in the spring, and because Barrett doesn't offer its professors tenure, the meetings always made him nervous.
And then, the police report says, Conz accidentally received an e-mail that was about him but not for him, one that referenced an upcoming meeting of the deans to discuss his relationship with the student.
At his April 3 review, Conz was told that his contract wouldn't be renewed.
""It was just a shock for him,"" Hollenberg says. ""They told him that it was okay.""
The student later would tell police that Conz was terminated after it was reported to a Barrett dean that he had given her alcohol. Under state law and current ASU policy, it's more problematic for a professor to hand an underage student a beer than it is for him to sleep with her.
After his firing, Conz spiraled. ""He was kind of acting like his life was over,"" Hollenberg says. ""That was his identity, and it was sort of just taken so suddenly.""
She says she and Conz discussed their options -- moving to Vancouver, working full-time on DIY projects -- ""but he just wasn't able to get that vision yet,"" she says. ""And he was worried that if they put something in his record that seemed derogatory, he would never get another professorship anyway.""
Conz began drinking heavily.
Five days after he was fired, on April 8, 2013, Hollenberg became worried when Conz didn't pick her up for a date they had planned. She called him, and he sounded drunk. So she went to his house.
Meanwhile, the student told police that she had arrived at Conz's house about 5 that evening. She found him in bed, drunk, next to two bottles of Black Velvet Whisky -- one empty, the other half full -- and a loaded .38-caliber revolver at his side.
The student hid the revolver in a closet and called Conz's ex-wife, a psychiatrist. While they were on the phone, Conz ran from the house.
Hollenberg arrived about 5:30 and met Conz and the student in the driveway, where the student told her what was happening.
At 5:59, the student called police, who told her to keep Conz out of the house, away from the guns. When Conz tried to go inside, she tackled him.
Hollenberg told police that a full-fledged fight ensued, with the student and her former professor punching and kicking each other. She says Conz called the student ""cunt,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole.""
The student told police that Conz told her ""it was her fault, that she got him fired.""
Finally, Conz broke free, yelling at the student: ""You caused this.""
He ran into the house and locked the women out. They got inside using a spare key, and almost immediately they heard gunshots coming from the locked hallway bathroom. The first shot blasted through the door, passing just above the student's head. Seven seconds later, a second shot entered Conz's mouth.
Police found Conz seated on the toilet, his pants pulled down. The bathroom floor and wall were splattered with blood, and a silver revolver was on the floor. A bullet had exited through the top of Conz's skull.
Conz was conscious on the way to the hospital -- he admitted to paramedics that he'd shot himself -- but he was listed in critical condition upon arrival.
Hollenberg visited Conz frequently. Though he was unconscious, she sang to him, read to him, and talked to him.
Conz's mother removed him from life support on April 12, and he died later that day.
Months after his death, Conz's mother gave police a note she found on a torn piece of paper in his home. It's not clear who it was intended for, but police found the note significant enough to include in their report.
""Your love blossoms within me,"" Conz wrote. ""Like a parasite to liberate or embrace you I must die.""
Throughout his autopsy and the lengthy police report, Conz's job loss -- consistently tied to his relationship with the student -- is named as a key contributing factor in his suicide. In the course of their investigation, police even interviewed Frederick Corey, the dean who had let Conz go. Corey did not return requests for comment on Conz's case.
The student later provided testimony for Jasmine Lester's Title IX complaint. In it, she says she saw her relationship with Conz as above board. She'd even introduced him to her parents.
""The relationship was highly pleasurable and showed no outward signs of abuse besides the innate power imbalance that resides within a 20-year age gap,"" she wrote.
""He was loved by many, and still is.""
The student took off three semesters after Conz's death. She no longer speaks to Hollenberg, who moved to Illinois.
Never in her testimony does the student say she regrets dating Conz. Instead, she takes aim at ASU's rules on such relationships.
""We continued the relationship,"" she writes, ""because we realized ASU had no policy regarding faculty-student relationships as long as the student is no longer in the professor's class.""

Professor Travis Pratt's affair with a graduate student didn't work out so well.
The criminal-justice expert has agreed to settle the student's lawsuit at the end of this month. He and his wife are no longer married.
And he was fired from Arizona State University -- on Valentine's Day.

-ASU Professor's Soured Affair with Grad Student Still Grinding Through Court
Pratt was actually fired for an affair with a second student -- not Kunzi.
Pratt arrived at ASU in 2008 from Washington State University, a humorous and popular teacher whose research on crime and prisons have been published extensively. One his students, Tasha Kunzi, whose masters thesis committee Pratt had chaired, followed him out and enrolled in ASU's criminal-justice doctoral program. The two began a romantic affair that lasted until Pratt's wife found out.
Kunzi broke off the relationship, claiming that Pratt's wife had begun harassing her. According to a lawsuit she filed in October of 2012, Pratt then retaliated against her. She claimed that he stalked her home on his motorcycle, bugged her on the phone, spread rumors about her to people in the criminal-justice department and hassled her new boyfriend, who was also student in the department.
In responses to Kunzi's claims, Pratt did not refute the general allegations, instead focusing on defeating the lawsuit on technicalities. See our previous stories for full details.
Kunzi had also sued department director Scott Decker, ASU and the state Board of Regents. Those defendants were dismissed from the lawsuit last month.
Pratt and Kunzi, however, are to complete their settlement agreement by April 25, court records show. The settlement terms were not made public.
Kunzi could not be reached, and her lawyer, Stephen Montoya, did not return our messages last week and today.
We noticed today that Pratt's ASU bio and listing as a faculty member had disappeared. We inquired with ASU this afternoon, and spokeswoman Sharon Keeler sent this statement:""Professor Travis Pratt's employment with the University ended February 14, 2014. He was dismissed for violation of university policy as well as violation of ASU's Code of Ethics for faculty and the Standards of Professional Conduct for Faculty Members and Academic Professionals.""Kunzi, meanwhile, married her boyfriend and now has two kids.
UPDATE: After publication, ASU confirmed that Pratt was fired not due to Kunzi, but because he had violated amorous-relationship policies with another student.

http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/barrett-the-honors-college-at-asu-is-a-close-knit-community-some-say-too-close-6633269,"
One morning last spring, Becca Smouse, a first-year student at Arizona State University's Barrett, The Honors College, jumped in her car and headed to Tempe for her intensive freshman seminar course, the Human Event.
The Human Event in many ways is the linchpin of Barrett's programming. It covers an ambitious topic -- the history of human ideas -- and is designed to challenge how students think through intensive reading, writing, and discussion.
Through the Human Event class and subsequent study-abroad trips, Barrett students begin to form the strong relationships with professors they will need as they move on to become teaching assistants and interns, to seek supervisors for their honors theses, and to apply for graduate school and jobs. The class is important, and so are the relationships it helps students to form.
But that March day, Smouse and her classmates found an unexpected note on their classroom door. It informed them that their professor, Dr. Joel Hunter, wouldn't make it in that day, or for the rest of the week. 

Smouse found the message odd, especially because Hunter usually was very communicative and it was unlike him to let students come all the way to campus just to find out that class was canceled. ""Why didn't he just e-mail us?"" she wondered.
Turns out, Dr. Hunter was never coming back.
A substitute arrived the next week, and students were told that Hunter wouldn't return that semester. Smouse says she and other students were worried about him at first.
Then, rumors began to swirl. Jokes about Hunter getting fired for sleeping with a student soon turned into campus-wide gossip.
But Barrett's administration remained silent. Smouse says she was disappointed in the lack of transparency, especially given the tight-knit nature of the school.
And she began to hear another rumor: This wasn't the first time something like this had happened at Barrett.
When an anonymously written blog post confirmed the gossip about Hunter, Smouse, a young journalist in training, responded the only way she knew how. She wrote about it, in an April 14 opinion piece for ASU's campus newspaper, The State Press.
""Unfortunately, the professor's controversial dismissal seems to have been left largely untouched by Barrett administration,"" she wrote. ""Rumors buzzing and parental concerns rising, the spotlight is shining brightly on the college's lack of acknowledgement. Many also see firing the professor as a cop-out, simply sweeping the problem under the rug of Barrett embarrassments. By cutting out the professor, it seems the college hoped to avoid confronting the situation all together.""
Turns out, sweeping Barrett's troubles under the rug hasn't been so easy.

One of Rebecca Smouse's Barrett classmates, Jane -- who asked to not be identified by her real name -- also was disappointed in the school's response.
But Jane wasn't just a student in Joel Hunter's class. She also was his lover.
In an April 10 blog post for a website called Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, Jane laid out details about her relationship with Hunter, the process of reporting him to the school, and his subsequent dismissal.
In the first 72 hours after her post was published, an attached petition calling on Barrett's dean to fire predatory professors collected more than 400 signatures.
""For the past 15 years, ASU's Barrett Honors College has been home to professors who sexually harass and sexually abuse students,"" the petition says. ""While romantic relationships between professors and students may seem consensual, the imbalance of power makes these relationships inherently coercive and abusive.""
Today, the petition has more than 1,000 signatures.
Jane's story is not unique.
In the past few years, Barrett has terminated the contracts of at least three professors who engaged in sexual relationships with students. Joel Hunter and Dr. Eric Susser were told their contracts were not being renewed after they admitted to violating ASU's student-professor relationship policies, and Dr. David Conz committed suicide after his contract was dropped when a student reported he'd given alcohol to the Barrett freshman he was dating. Police records, documents given to New Times by involved students, and reports by other media outlets confirm the terminations.
But some say the number of Barrett faculty members skirting the rules -- and whose contracts may have been dropped -- actually is far higher.
Barrett administrators aren't talking, but Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, replied on their behalf. ""Such relationships are inappropriate and do not comport with how we expect members of the faculty and lecturers to behave,"" Johnson says, ""and when such relationships are brought to our attention, appropriate steps are taken.""
In a three-month investigation of the issues at Barrett, New Times interviewed former and current Barrett students and staff and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal university documents, written student testimonials provided to the government in a formal complaint, and police reports.
ASU president Michael Crow did not respond to an interview request. Many of New Times' public records requests -- asking for everything from personnel files to police reports on these and other cases -- went largely ignored or unfilled. Much is still unknown.
But one thing is clear: Inappropriate student-professor relationships at Barrett have been a poorly kept secret for years.
ASU has, in fact, had its share of troubles when it comes to sex.
In May 2014, just a few weeks after Jane's blog post was published, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights made an unprecedented move: It announced the names of all schools being investigated for possible violations of Title IX, the federal legislation dictating how sexual violence and harassment complaints should be handled at schools that receive federal funding.
ASU was on the list of 55 schools. A Department of Education spokesman says the Office for Civil Rights is still investigating the university, but he did not provide further details.
For the most part, the problems at ASU have been linked to two worlds where these issues are better known: fraternities and athletics. ASU previously settled federal lawsuits dealing with the university's responses to two alleged sexual assaults, one involving a football player and the other a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
But a Title IX complaint filed in June 2014 by Jasmine Lester, a former Barrett student, asks the Office for Civil Rights to focus on a different sexual abuse problem on campus: that of professors sleeping with their undergraduate students.
At Barrett, and across all of ASU, professor-student relationships are banned in certain contexts, like when a student is currently in a professor's class or when a professor is supervising a student's thesis. But this policy still allows room for involvement between professors and students.
And particularly at Barrett, which educates more than 5,000 of ASU's nearly 60,000 undergraduates, there have been repeated issues with professors skirting -- sometimes, even defying -- the rules.
Prestigious universities across the nation have drawn much harder lines in regard to such relationships. In 2010, Yale University banned faculty members from forming relationships with any undergraduate students, noting in its updated policy that undergrads ""are particularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship."" In 2013, the University of Connecticut implemented a similar ban.
Last fall, ASU's faculty senate debated whether to replace its own policy with an outright ban on professor-undergraduate relationships.
At a senate meeting in November, Cynthia Tompkins, chair of the committee drafting the proposed policy changes, referenced the scope of ASU's problem. She said at least 20 faculty members across ASU have been dismissed for having inappropriate sexual relationships with students in recent years.
ASU hasn't provided the exact number of dismissals stemming from Barrett or elsewhere. ""We do not keep a running tally of faculty who are disciplined for [relationship policy] violations,"" a spokesman says. A representative from the university office charged with investigating these policy violations wouldn't comment on how many investigations she has conducted.
But when ASU was named on the list of schools under federal review, Michael Crow did speak to The State Press' editorial board, and he addressed the problem at Barrett.
Student journalist Nicholas Palomino Mendoza reported on May 7, 2014, that Crow said he was aware of ""reports of inappropriate sexual conduct between Barrett faculty and students.""
""If it's consensual in a sense of the way that the law looks at things,"" Mendoza quotes Crow as saying, ""then it is inappropriate from the perspective of how we expect our faculty members or our instructors to behave.""
""There have been professors in relationships with students, and when we find out about it, they are all fired,"" Crow told the paper.
The revisions to ASU's professor-undergraduate relationship policy would aim to switch the school's focus from reactive to proactive, and from firing violators to improving the culture around these relationships on the front end.
At the first reading of the proposed revisions in early October, Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, made clear what the policy changes would mean.
""To put it rather bluntly,"" she said, ""ASU students are not part of your dating pool.""

Barrett, the Honors College, is a school within a school.
Admissions documents say Barrett consists of ""living-learning communities"" of academically driven students from across ASU's four campuses. Barrett is where the cream of the ASU crop goes to be educated.
Barrett marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. The University Honors College was granted official status in 1988, when it became the first residential honors college in the nation. It was renamed for former Intel CEO Craig Barrett and his wife, Barbara, a former ambassador to Finland and Arizona gubernatorial candidate, after they endowed the school with a $10 million gift in 2000. The college has undergone great growth in recent years, with its current student body size rivaling its alumni population.
In its admissions literature, Barrett distinguishes itself from the wider university. Though the majority of ASU students were in the top 25 percent of their graduating high school classes, for example, most Barrett students were in the top 10 percent. One year, students donned T-shirts that read ""_arrett, the Honors College. We don't get B's.""
All of Barrett's honors faculty fellows hold Ph.D.s, and the school boasts a 15-to-1 student-faculty ratio, small in comparison to ASU's ratio of 22-to-1. Students, sometimes called ""The Commas"" in a reference to the school's stuffy title, almost universally refer to Barrett as tight-knit.
The college's largest campus is at the corner of Apache Boulevard and Rural Road in Tempe, neatly tucked behind a set of iron gates on ASU's central campus. The Barrett campus is fully enclosed, and were it not for some classes they take elsewhere, Barrett students practically could spend their college lives there. Students are, in fact, expected to live on campus for at least their first two years.
Barrett's central campus is reminiscent of the exclusive private schools Barrett emulates. It's got everything but the ivy and, indeed, references to the Ivy League (Harvard of the Southwest, anyone?) are not uncommon. Some students jokingly refer to the campus as ""The Nerd Cage.""
Outside, students gather in groups and study in solitude on the sandstone benches surrounding Barrett's green lawns. There's an outdoor fireplace for cold-weather gatherings and a volleyball pit.
Inside, Barrett's buildings serve multiple purposes, reflecting the insular nature of the Barrett community. One can find professors' offices, student dorms, and classrooms interspersed throughout any given structure.
In the Honors Hall -- in many ways, the hub of Barrett life -- there's a gym with flat-screen TVs and elliptical machines, a spiral staircase leading downstairs to a coffee shop, and a recreational area with ping-pong tables.
There's also the beautiful Refectory, or, as students call it in a reference to Harry Potter's Hogwarts, the Great Hall. On a Friday afternoon in December, one student casually played the grand piano as others sat at long tables with high-backed chairs and feasted in the hall's wood-paneled dining room.
In an adjacent hallway, photographs of Barrett students who went on to win prestigious fellowships line the walls: 185 Fulbright scholars, 52 Marshall scholars, 54 Goldwater scholars. The list goes on.
Barrett students major in any field they choose, taking classes in the disciplinary college of their choice. One student says there can be tension between Barrett and the rest of ASU, in part because of the special privileges afforded to Barrett students. Barrett students get to register for classes before others, for example, and sometimes are offered special courses the general ASU population can't take.
This includes the Human Event, a mandatory two-semester seminar taken during freshmen year.
Barrett freshmen may take a different professor for each semester of the intensive course, but they are encouraged to stick with one. They also are encouraged to participate in for-credit, study-abroad trips with their professors during the summer after the course finishes.
The Human Event is ""a wonderful course to get students into the idea of working closely with a professor,"" says a former staff member who asked to not be identified. But she says she also believes the class has contributed to the problem of too-close professor-student relations.
""Because it was so friendly,"" she says, ""if you had any faculty members who were not terribly ethical in how they related to youngsters, it was a situation in which they could take advantage.""
With these professors, sources tell New Times, office hours turn into intimate meetings. Examination of the ancient Greeks may have an odd focus on the sexual relationships between mentors and mentees. Trips abroad are fueled more by alcohol than by learning.
To many, Barrett's very structure, intended to create a close learning community for students and professors alike, has instead become something sinister: a way for predatory teachers to grow close to -- sometimes, even sexually -- the young and ambitious students in their tutelage.

Jane first was drawn to Barrett because of its strong sense of community. She enrolled in the school in 2012.
Her story unfolds in her blog post, interviews and e-mails with New Times, and a pile of documents she provided to the government in a Title IX complaint against ASU. The documents include Jane's personal e-mails and text messages as well as copies of e-mails she received from ASU detailing the investigation into and eventual dismissal of Dr. Joel Hunter.
Hunter, a Barrett faculty member since 2008, admitted to the university and to New Times that he violated ASU's professor-undergraduate relationships policy before his contract was dropped.
On his personal website, Hunter lists the many awards he won during his time at Barrett, including accolades for teaching excellence, academic service, and faculty mentoring.
Since he left the school, Hunter also has posted a lengthy student tutorial on how to succeed in Barrett's difficult freshmen seminar course. ""It is best to err on the side of formality,"" he wrote in a late September post focused on how to best communicate with one's Human Event professor. These professors are ""incredibly friendly and funny, yes,"" he writes, ""but they are not in your peer group.""
It seems hindsight is 20/20.
By the end of Jane's fall semester in Hunter's Human Event class, she and the professor had grown close.
In December 2012, Hunter e-mailed Jane, asking her to interrupt a meeting so it wouldn't drag on. ""Plus, I would get to see one of my favorite Human Event students twice in one day,"" he wrote.
Jane signed up to take Hunter's class again in the spring.
By January 2013, the two began getting together regularly for meetings and meals. Soon, they were texting, and by early February, their texts hinted at a sexual relationship.
Some texts reference a trip the two took to a local park, where Jane says Hunter provided her with alcohol and massaged her, suggesting that doing so would be easier if she didn't have clothes on. They spent the afternoon kissing.
A few weeks later, Hunter texted Jane about 2 a.m. from a Harry Potter conference he was attending in Albuquerque:
Joel: get your ass to albuquerque now dammit. I just closed down the hotel bar with a harry potter student of mine who will not, i'm sure of it, sleep with me. All alone am i . . .
Jane alleges that Hunter shared with her sexual fantasies about other Human Event students and said he'd fallen in love with a student before.
The two went on to have a covert sexual relationship -- aside from the clear violation of policy, Hunter was married with children -- having sex in cars, in Hunter's office, and in parking garages around campus. Jane says Hunter gave her extensions on schoolwork because of their relationship.
In their talks, interspersed with innuendo, was conversation about Jane's future.
Texts from the day after their trip to the park:
Jane: How is my letter of recommendation coming? :)
Joel: It'll be done this afternoon.
And an hour later:
Joel: Letter submitted electronically. They won't be able to give you the scholarship quickly enough . . .
Jane: You mean I don't get to read it? Noooooooooooooo
Joel: I'll share it with you later. It's totally hot.
Then, in April of Jane's freshman year, Barrett Professor David Conz committed suicide shortly after his teaching contract was dropped. Conz's dismissal was linked to a relationship with one of his Human Event students. Jane says Hunter made out Conz to be the victim of an unfair administration and began expressing fears about losing his own job.
A text conversation in the days that followed:
Jane: I know you didn't want a hug, but are you ok? I don't think I've ever seen you look so sad.
Joel: Im ok. Shook up, sad and feeling vulnerable. Life. 
In May 2013, Jane and Hunter had sexual intercourse in a motel.
The spring semester came to a close, and Jane fully expected that she and Hunter would resume their relationship when she returned for her sophomore year. The two even texted occasionally during the summer.
But when Jane returned to campus in August, she says, Hunter told her he'd learned that their affair was risky after a discussion at a Barrett faculty retreat. He abruptly broke off the relationship.
""One thing my professor said to me when he ended this affair still sticks out to me,"" Jane wrote in the closing of her Title IX complaint testimony. ""He had no idea that what he was doing was wrong or even against the rules, because it was so common for Barrett Honors College professors to be involved with students that all of the honors faculty saw it as normal.""
Hunter declined to be interviewed, and New Times isn't aware of what he is up to today. On his personal website, he says he is a married father of three.

On a Monday afternoon in early November, Arizona State University's faculty senate gathered to discuss, among other things, a motion to revise the Academic Affairs Manual (ACD) policy governing ""amorous relationships"" between professors and students. That policy, ACD 402, has been on the books since 1982.
In Tempe's Education Lecture Hall, a single observer watched from a seat toward the back. Jasmine Lester, a 2011 Barrett grad, is a small woman with curly brown hair. She wears glasses and looks younger than her 25 years.
Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, first laid out some ground rules. She asked senate members to refrain from dominating, and she made clear just who was invited to discuss this motion.
""Observers are welcome to observe as much as you want,"" she said. ""But be like children. You may be seen but not heard.""
For many years, ASU's amorous relationships guidelines fell under the university's sexual harassment policy. But in 2011, they were parsed to create a policy focused exclusively on consensual romantic or sexual student-professor relationships.
As written today, ACD 402 bans ASU employees from making key decisions -- grading, hiring, disciplining, or offering recommendations -- over anyone with whom they are in a sexual relationship. The policy bans faculty members from engaging in relationships with any students currently enrolled in their classes, and it says violations can result in disciplinary action up to termination.
But in 2014, the senate began considering revisions to ACD 402 that would give the policy much greater reach, banning all relationships between ASU faculty and undergraduate students.
If approved, the revisions would require faculty members to report any such relationships to a supervisor immediately, with policy exemptions made on a case-by-case basis.
""Our current policies regarding faculty-student relationships are inadequate as written,"" university spokesman Mark Johnson tells New Times. ""The faculty senate should be applauded for taking steps to strengthen those policies to ensure that faculty members and lecturers have only professional relationships with students.""
That November day, Cynthia Tompkins, who chaired the policy-revision task force, addressed the faculty senate. During the month-long comment period that preceded this meeting, she explained, many seemed to think the proposed revisions had come out of left field.
Tompkins acknowledged that professor-student relationships historically have had a wide range of acceptability -- you hear stories of professor-student couples that happily marry, she noted -- but she said many unacceptable versions have taken place at ASU in recent years.
In addition to the 20 firings mentioned above, Tompkins said, ASU has had at least one unwanted student-professor pregnancy this year.
The intent of the policy revisions, she said, is to put students back at the center of focus.
The floor was opened for discussion. Faculty members approached the microphone to raise questions and concerns.
Many were worried about the scope of the revised language. ASU is a big school. Would professors need to start IDing everyone they meet in Tempe?
The new language doesn't make clear just which relationships would be exempt. What about pre-existing ones? And what would happen if a professor reports a relationship and doesn't get an exemption?
""You really think about whether you want that relationship,"" Ossipov answered. ""One person would have to leave the university.""
Tensions rose.
""I want to be blunt. I think this policy is very invasive,"" a female faculty member said. ""Every amorous relationship is not a 40-year-old faculty member and an 18-year-old-student.""
Concerns were raised about privacy and the motion's intrusiveness and scope.
Finally, a frustrated female senator in the back of the auditorium walked up to the microphone and moved to vote down the controversial motion.
Twenty senators voted in favor of the policy revision. One abstained from voting.
And with 62 votes against the changes, the motion was -- for the time being, at least -- dead.
Ossipov said the motion would be returned to Tompkins' committee for further revisions. ""However, this will come back,"" she said. There was uncomfortable laughter.
On January 26, the senate will hold its next vote on the revisions.
As the faculty senator who effectively silenced the conversation made her way back to her seat, Jasmine Lester glared at her, her middle finger raised in the air. ""This is my whole life,"" Lester said. ""And she just shot it down.""

Jasmine Lester is an Arizona native with ASU roots. She grew up in Ahwatukee, the child of a mother who handles internship programming at the university and a father who is a professor and former dean of humanities in the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Lester's parents aren't affiliated directly with Barrett.
Lester enrolled in the honors college in 2007. Like Jane, she formed a close relationship with a professor, who hasn't returned New Times' request for comment.
New Times is limiting the details of Lester's story because of ongoing legal action.
In conversations with New Times and in her Title IX complaint, Lester says her relationship with the professor took on a dynamic that extended beyond professional boundaries.
In 2010, Lester went to ASU's Office of Equity and Inclusion to discuss the matter with Kamala Green, the office's executive director and ASU's Title IX compliance coordinator.
Green's responsibilities include investigating Title IX violations when a faculty or staff member is the accused.
But Lester says Green didn't see her situation as a violation. ""I was trying to tell her that this is how the power dynamic creates an inherently abusive dynamic or situation,"" Lester says, ""but she didn't understand that. She kept being like, 'You don't know what rape is.'""
Lester says she felt unheard -- silenced, even -- by the school.
A university spokesman says Lester's claims were investigated and that there was no finding of any policy violation on the part of the professor. Green cannot comment on individual cases, but says, ""ASU takes these cases very seriously, and we investigate every one of them as quickly as we possibly can.""
Lester never got the outcome she wanted from ASU, but she funneled her frustration into helping others.
In 2013 -- two years after she graduated -- Lester founded Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, an advocacy group focused on connecting ASU students with the national Title IX movement. Through that work, she began collecting stories of abuse, and by June 2014, she had enough information to file a formal Title IX complaint against ASU. Lester's complaint, which is still under investigation, will be incorporated into the ongoing federal investigation of ASU.
""I know how administrators maintain the status quo,"" Lester says. ""They wait for people to graduate. I didn't leave after I graduated. I stayed bugging them about it for the next three years.""
Lester's complaint focuses on several areas: sexual violence in Greek culture, a lack of resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students on campus, and the culture at Barrett.
The Barrett portion names names. It tells stories of alleged abuse by 11 Barrett professors, many still employees of the school.
Lester's complaint also details the school's response to Jane.
Jane was devastated when Hunter broke off their relationship. She continued to see him on campus, and she says she became depressed to the point of attempting suicide. As time passed -- and after she learned of Lester's work on campus -- Jane says her view of the relationship changed.
""He took advantage of his power over me to coerce me,"" Jane says in an e-mail. ""This wasn't a consensual relationship. It was sexual abuse and it was rape.""
In the testimony she provided for Lester's complaint, Jane says she felt trapped by the need to maintain Hunter as a reference, as well as fear that coming forward would mar her reputation, make her feel unsafe, and harm her relationships with other faculty. So she didn't say anything.
But in March 2014, she broke down and told two Barrett professors about the affair. Without warning her, they reported the situation to Barrett's dean of students. Jane was asked to come in -- against her will -- for a meeting.
In a process she calls ""organized intimidation,"" Jane says she told her story to Barrett's deans, to campus counseling and advocacy offices, and eventually to Kamala Green.
""I was put through the ringer, dragged across campus to people I didn't want to talk to, not provided any university support like a victim's advocate or anything, and victim-blamed either directly or indirectly at every single step,"" she says in an e-mail.
Days after Green and Jane's meeting, Hunter was sent a letter releasing him from all duties, effective immediately.
Barrett's deans called for a meeting of the faculty. A former staff member who wishes to remain unidentified says faculty were told that any additional complaint of abuse by a professor would lead to the dissolution of the signature Human Event course.
Because that seminar distinguishes Barrett from the rest of ASU, its dissolution could mean Barrett faculty no longer would be necessary.
In June, three months after she first filed her complaint, Jane received a final written decision from the university provost, based on the investigation conducted by Green's office. The investigation found that Joel Hunter violated ASU's policy on amorous relationships, as well as the university's code of ethics, by engaging in a sexual relationship with Jane while she was in his class.
Hunter declined to be interviewed, but he did send New Times a brief comment by e-mail.
Hunter confirmed that his contract was not renewed because he violated ACD 402.
But he still speaks highly of Barrett. ""My experience was that it is a great culture with caring, supportive deans and staff, a stellar faculty who are committed to teaching excellence, and the brightest students I've ever had the pleasure to teach,"" he wrote.
Jane currently is a junior at the honors college. ""For the most part, I avoid Barrett,"" she says. ""I just go to classes, and I live off campus now, so it's not as bad. But the thing at Barrett is you always run into people you are trying to avoid. It's this wonderful honors community, where the deans and professors are always out socializing with the students,"" she says with obvious sarcasm.
""There are individually decent people in the administration,"" Jane notes. ""The problem is they can't change anything. There's nothing they can do as individuals to change the overwhelming institutional problems of rape culture and prioritizing the school's reputation over supporting victims.""
The very community that drew Jane to Barrett now is a disappointment to her. She points to the deans' treatment of her; the school's reporting process, which she says was marred by poor communication and missed deadlines; the faculty and staff who have ignored this problem for years; and the students who looked for reasons to blame her.
""They should really be ashamed of themselves,"" she says.

Dr. Eric Susser, an award-winning Barrett professor -- he was both the first non tenure-track recipient of the prestigious Founder's Day Faculty Achievement Award in Teaching and voted ""Hottest Professor"" in The State Press' annual poll on more than one occasion -- also had his contract dropped because of ACD 402 violations.
(New Times Managing Editor Amy Silverman and Susser's ex-wife, Deborah Sussman, have co-taught a local writing workshop for more than a decade.)
On www.ratemyprofessors.com, a national website on which students post anonymous professor reviews, comments show how the intimacy and intensity of the Human Event course can sometimes shift the tone of student-professor relationships down an inappropriate path.
Susser received the following comments from students in his class:
• 9/18/2005: ""Susser understands how to relate to college students. He's very entertaining and engaging. He's incredibly smart and the class is very thought-provoking . . . I loved this class. Plus I sort of had a crush on him.""
• 7/20/2010: ""Dr. Susser is wonderful! Not only did he take a special interest in me, he sought out students who needed extra help  made time for all of us to meet with him 1:1. If you need coaching for your writing or classroom participation, he's the guy to go to. But he's also full of himself. Don't let on that you think he's hot. Play it cool you'll be OK.""
Susser, who taught at Barrett for 15 years, developed and led the college's wildly popular trips to Paris. Like all Barrett professors, Susser pushed his Human Event students to join.
Rumors about inappropriate happenings on those trips swirled for years. A former Barrett staff member who wishes to remain anonymous says she heard students saying they wanted to go on the Paris trip specifically in hopes of sleeping with Susser.
The Paris trips eventually came to a stop, right around the time Susser left the school.
ASU hasn't fulfilled New Times' requests for copies of personnel files, including those of Susser, but Fox 10 News did obtain the records for a September 17 report.
According to documents shown in Fox 10's newscast, Susser's contract was not renewed in 2012 after he admitted to having sexual relationships with three Barrett students.
Susser, who divorced in 2005 and remarried in 2012, hasn't returned multiple requests for comment.
ASU did provide New Times with a July 2012 letter in which Barrett Dean Mark Jacobs notified Susser that he would not receive an annual academic year appointment.
Instead, Susser was offered a ""limited appointment"" for the fall semester only. He was told he would work on curriculum development, as a telecommuter, until his final date of employment on December 21 of that year. He no longer would have office space at Barrett -- he was given two weeks to clear out his personal belongings -- and he was told he no longer would teach or supervise student projects.
The letter doesn't detail why Susser's relationship with the school changed.
Though the university wouldn't share more detailed records with New Times, ASU Police Department records do describe the former professor's behavior.
According to one ASU police report, on the morning of March 31, 2014 -- 15 months after Susser's contract ended -- a staff member at the university's largest library, Hayden, found a brown bag that had been left behind on the second floor.
Inside, she located an ASU identification card with Eric Susser's name on it. She tried to e-mail Susser about the bag, but the e-mail -- likely because Susser no longer was employed by ASU -- didn't transmit.
The staff member continued to look and found more than she expected in the backpack. She contacted ASU's police.
Police listed the impounded bag's contents in their report. In addition to two ASU identification cards, a bill, and a MasterCard all bearing Susser's name, police found ""2 lancets, 3 meth pipes (one with residue), two pill containers (one possibly containing crystal meth), a bag of empty pill capsules, and a prescription bottle made out to Susser which contained various tablets.""
The tablets: ""oxycodone, amphetamine, Viagra,"" and more.
Police initially were unable to contact Susser -- his driver's license was suspended, they wrote in the report -- so the case was marked as pending. Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, says Susser recently was served with a no-trespass order barring him from campus.
But this wasn't Susser's first incident at ASU's libraries, or the ASU Police Department's first hint that the professor might be troubled.
Susser once was the subject of a handwritten field interrogation card, also drafted by ASU's police force. That 2002 document details some of the professor's other alleged extracurricular pursuits.
""Susser was contacted after a 101"" -- in police code, a 101 is a woman in a car -- ""said he exposed himself on the third floor of law library,"" police wrote.
The officer noted that a subject matching Susser's description was involved in a similar incident, in the same location, just two days before.
According to the report, Susser admitted to the officer that he was ""checking out women,"" but he denied having exposed himself.
The officer who wrote the report tells New Times he has no specific recollection of the incident.
But at the time, he clearly knew who Susser was. He listed Susser's ASU affiliation as ""faculty,"" and under employer, he wrote: ""ASU (Honors College).""
Just what happened after ASU police learned that the professor allegedly had flashed students is unclear.
The ASU Police Department says it no longer can find a copy of this document in its files. Kamala Green wasn't aware of the incident, though she wasn't in office at the time, and Mark Johnson, the university spokesman, hasn't provided specific comment on this report. For now, the trail ends at the ASU Police Department, which hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment.
Johnson says he doesn't know whether police notified Barrett or ASU administrators of the incident. ""Under current police department practice, the department would notify senior administrators and the relevant department,"" he says. ""I can't speak to what the practice may have been under the previous police administration.""
But one thing is clear: Susser kept his job for another decade after this report.
It's unknown whether Susser has found employment as a university professor, but he apparently has kept busy since leaving ASU. In June 2014, the Cooking Channel aired an episode of its show Belly Up! -- a kind of Bar Rescue rip-off -- titled ""Hidden Issues."" The episode focused on Susser's latest endeavor: a bar in West Phoenix called The Hideaway West Bar and Grill.
A student commenter on www.ratemyprofessors.com wrote of Susser in 2008: ""Susser is amazing because he lets the discussions go where they will and interjects when he has something important to say. Very intelligent professor, although a little slimy as a person.""

The problem at Barrett admittedly is complex.
Even 18-year-old freshmen are adults capable of giving consent under the law.
But experts tend to agree that stricter policies, such as the one ASU is considering, make more sense. Doctors can't sleep with patients and lawyers can't sleep with clients, so why should professors be able to sleep with their students?
Dr. Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, an expert on young adults, author of Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, says his research supports ""a taboo"" on all faculty-undergraduate relationships.
""It's almost inevitably exploitative,"" he says, ""even if neither side thinks of it that way.""
Arnett coined the term ""emerging adulthood"" to describe the time from 18 to 25 before people take on the full set of adult responsibilities, like career, marriage, and family. His research on emerging adults in many ways reflects common sense: People between these ages look and can act like grownups, but they just aren't equipped to make the greatest decisions.
""People's decision-making abilities are not as developed at 19 or 20 as they will be at 40 or 50,"" Arnett says. ""Do you really want to be 19 and in a class with a professor you like, and your roommate's dating him? That is weird by any standard, and it's disruptive to the central mission of the university, which is to teach young people, to prepare them for adult life.""
Seth Schwartz, a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and the incoming president of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, similarly is concerned.
""It's sort of hard to say no,"" Schwartz says. ""That's the major problem with these relationships between students and faculty: Are you willing to say no to someone who is in a position of authority over you?""

Dr. David Bruce Conz died with his pants around his ankles.
Conz, 39, was open with the university about a relationship he'd formed with a former student. But his tale took a tragic turn.
His autopsy report lays out what happened:
""Cause of death: gunshot wound to head and brain.""
""Manner: suicide.""
Under ""Diagnoses and Significant Findings,"" the medical examiner lists ""history of depression over work situation.""
Friends and family didn't see it coming.
Conz was a two-time ASU alum, and he began teaching at the school in 2005. A dedicated home brewer, Conz was nicknamed ""Professor Beer"" and led a popular ASU course in which students developed their own concoctions.
Conz formed a relationship with a Barrett freshman who recently had completed his Human Event course. Soon after, he shot himself in the mouth.
Rebekah Hollenberg was Conz's long-term girlfriend. The two met while swing dancing downtown, and they had been together for two and a half years at the time of his death.
""He studied do-it-yourself things, and he would make his own biodiesel and raise his own chickens,"" Hollenberg says. ""He was brilliant in so many ways.""
Conz and Hollenberg were polyamorous -- they were open with each other about dating other people -- and in late December 2012, Conz told Hollenberg that he was seeing a former student.
""The type of relationship we had is sort of unconventional and hard for people to understand,"" Hollenberg says. ""I was supportive of [the student] and Dave's relationship. I made them dinner. I gave them gifts. I wanted to make them happy.""
The former student asks not to be identified and declined to be interviewed for this story, but much of her tale is revealed in a detailed police report on Conz's death.
Around February 2013, Conz told Hollenberg he was called into a meeting at Barrett to discuss the relationship, ""a kind of review to see that everything was above board,"" she says.
Conz told Hollenberg that they were given the all-clear. The student no longer was in his class, so the relationship wasn't in violation of ASU policy.
Regardless, Conz began worrying about his job security after the meeting. He was scheduled for a formal contract renewal review later in the spring, and because Barrett doesn't offer its professors tenure, the meetings always made him nervous.
And then, the police report says, Conz accidentally received an e-mail that was about him but not for him, one that referenced an upcoming meeting of the deans to discuss his relationship with the student.
At his April 3 review, Conz was told that his contract wouldn't be renewed.
""It was just a shock for him,"" Hollenberg says. ""They told him that it was okay.""
The student later would tell police that Conz was terminated after it was reported to a Barrett dean that he had given her alcohol. Under state law and current ASU policy, it's more problematic for a professor to hand an underage student a beer than it is for him to sleep with her.
After his firing, Conz spiraled. ""He was kind of acting like his life was over,"" Hollenberg says. ""That was his identity, and it was sort of just taken so suddenly.""
She says she and Conz discussed their options -- moving to Vancouver, working full-time on DIY projects -- ""but he just wasn't able to get that vision yet,"" she says. ""And he was worried that if they put something in his record that seemed derogatory, he would never get another professorship anyway.""
Conz began drinking heavily.
Five days after he was fired, on April 8, 2013, Hollenberg became worried when Conz didn't pick her up for a date they had planned. She called him, and he sounded drunk. So she went to his house.
Meanwhile, the student told police that she had arrived at Conz's house about 5 that evening. She found him in bed, drunk, next to two bottles of Black Velvet Whisky -- one empty, the other half full -- and a loaded .38-caliber revolver at his side.
The student hid the revolver in a closet and called Conz's ex-wife, a psychiatrist. While they were on the phone, Conz ran from the house.
Hollenberg arrived about 5:30 and met Conz and the student in the driveway, where the student told her what was happening.
At 5:59, the student called police, who told her to keep Conz out of the house, away from the guns. When Conz tried to go inside, she tackled him.
Hollenberg told police that a full-fledged fight ensued, with the student and her former professor punching and kicking each other. She says Conz called the student ""cunt,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole.""
The student told police that Conz told her ""it was her fault, that she got him fired.""
Finally, Conz broke free, yelling at the student: ""You caused this.""
He ran into the house and locked the women out. They got inside using a spare key, and almost immediately they heard gunshots coming from the locked hallway bathroom. The first shot blasted through the door, passing just above the student's head. Seven seconds later, a second shot entered Conz's mouth.
Police found Conz seated on the toilet, his pants pulled down. The bathroom floor and wall were splattered with blood, and a silver revolver was on the floor. A bullet had exited through the top of Conz's skull.
Conz was conscious on the way to the hospital -- he admitted to paramedics that he'd shot himself -- but he was listed in critical condition upon arrival.
Hollenberg visited Conz frequently. Though he was unconscious, she sang to him, read to him, and talked to him.
Conz's mother removed him from life support on April 12, and he died later that day.
Months after his death, Conz's mother gave police a note she found on a torn piece of paper in his home. It's not clear who it was intended for, but police found the note significant enough to include in their report.
""Your love blossoms within me,"" Conz wrote. ""Like a parasite to liberate or embrace you I must die.""
Throughout his autopsy and the lengthy police report, Conz's job loss -- consistently tied to his relationship with the student -- is named as a key contributing factor in his suicide. In the course of their investigation, police even interviewed Frederick Corey, the dean who had let Conz go. Corey did not return requests for comment on Conz's case.
The student later provided testimony for Jasmine Lester's Title IX complaint. In it, she says she saw her relationship with Conz as above board. She'd even introduced him to her parents.
""The relationship was highly pleasurable and showed no outward signs of abuse besides the innate power imbalance that resides within a 20-year age gap,"" she wrote.
""He was loved by many, and still is.""
The student took off three semesters after Conz's death. She no longer speaks to Hollenberg, who moved to Illinois.
Never in her testimony does the student say she regrets dating Conz. Instead, she takes aim at ASU's rules on such relationships.
""We continued the relationship,"" she writes, ""because we realized ASU had no policy regarding faculty-student relationships as long as the student is no longer in the professor's class.""

The university confirmed the accuracy of the State Press report. But there are still other reviews the university has to undertake before Krauss, a tenured professor, could be dismissed.Earlier this year, the university did not renew Krauss' role as director of the Origins Project, a center that holds workshops on the origins of the universe and life.ASU President Michael Crow told the State Press' editorial board about Kenney's recommendation in September, the paper reported. Crow told them the university had stripped Krauss of roles that it was in full control of.RELATED:ASU professor Krauss ousted from post after sex misconduct claims""We have eliminated his role as director of Origins, his academic chair, and the dean has recommended that his tenure be revoked,"" Crow told the publication.

Then, the faculty member can challenge the recommendation in what is called a conciliation or mediation, and a conciliation committee comprised of faculty members is set up.RELATED:ASU professor Krauss put on leave amid allegations of sexual misconductKrauss is in the conciliation process right now, a university spokesman said. Kenney, Krauss and the president of the University Senate all appointed one member to serve on the committee.The conciliation committee's goal is to find a ""mutually agreed upon solution,"" according to Board of Regents' policy.If the conciliation process fails, Crow can issue a written notice of dismissal. Krauss could then appeal this notice to the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure and receive a hearing.The committee makes a recommendation to Crow, who then makes a decision on dismissal. Krauss has another opportunity to ask for reconsideration before a final decision from Crow.The entire process can take many months. READ MORE:"
https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/13/2-professors-resign-amid-rape-charges,"Amid allegations of rape from a former student, two professors at Arkansas State University resigned this month, just as the institution was reportedly planning to fire them.
The 25-year-old female Arkansas State University student accused Gregory Russell, an associate professor, and his wife, Ellen Lemley, an assistant professor, of raping her at their home on the night of April 19. Both professors were in the department of criminology, sociology and geography.
The student, whose identity Inside Higher Ed will protect consistent with its policy of not identifying victims of alleged sex crimes, reported the rape to the university before the couple resigned on June 1 but not to Jonesboro law-enforcement officials until June 6, when she applied for ""orders of protection"" against the couple. In statements submitted to Craighead County Circuit Court, the student said she “took steps to let ASU know that I had been raped by the couple and after investigation, they were to be terminated, but instead resigned on June 1, 2007.”
The student accused the couple of drugging her at a restaurant and then raping her at their home. She said she feared that they would “retaliate against me” for losing their jobs and because Russell had “continued to harass me through phone calls, messages and in person .”
Arkansas State's communications director, Tom Moore, confirmed that Russell and Lemley had resigned from the university on June 1. Citing confidentiality of personnel files, he declined to say whether the university had been considering firing the couple at the time they quit or to provide any further information about the investigation.
Glen Jones, Arkansas State’s interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and research, released a statement on June 7 in which he said the university has “a zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment and will not tolerate any employee or student violating this policy.”
Jones added that when there is an allegation of sexual harassment, the university “promptly investigate[s] and, when an allegation is determined to be valid, an appropriate remedy is identified and implemented.”
Neither Russell nor Lemley, nor their lawyer, could be reached for comment; calls to the professors' offices and to their home were not returned. But Russell told the Jonesboro Sun that “everything that happened was consensual.” Russell also told a local television station, KAIT-8, that the couple's lawyer was preparing a libel/slander lawsuit against the student and possibly others.
The Student’s Perspective
The student’s lawyer, Paul N. Ford, was unavailable for comment. In her statement to local authorities, the student said that the professors had invited her and her friends to join them at their table at Brickhouse Grill in downtown Jonesboro, less than two miles from the Arkansas State campus. The student said she had taken classes with both professors.
“It is believed,” the student said in her statement, “that Dr. Russell drugged my drinks with Dr. Lemley’s knowledge.”
The student said that she “blacked out” and didn’t “remember anything from sitting at the table to waking up naked and covered in blood” from her waist to her thighs in the professors' home.
Russell, the student said in her statement, told her that she had been “so messed up” the previous night that he needed to carry her out of the restaurant. Then, the student alleges, Lemley joined the student in the bed where she had woken up and lay down there. Russell later drove the student back to her apartment, the statement said.
She alleged that days later, Russell and Lemley began leaving her voice mail messages expressing their feelings for the student and urging her to ""be with"" Russell.
Craighead County Judge Barbara Halsey denied the request for orders of protection against Russell and Lemley, ruling that the case did not fall under Arkansas’ Domestic Abuse Act.
Copies of the voice mail recordings were given to police, Detective Ernest Ward said, adding that he has received 325 pages of e-mail messages, instant message logs and handwritten statements from Arkansas State students and others who know the couple.
Ward said he has yet to find evidence supporting the student’s claim in those documents. “Nothing that I’ve read so far [is pertinent],” he said. “But that doesn’t mean I won’t turn the page and find something that can be used as evidence.” Because the alleged rape happened nearly two months ago, Ward said his investigation relies on what he learns from the student and the professors, as well as the contents of the documents and voice mail recordings he has received.
He is to interview Russell and Lemley on Thursday, he said, “once their lawyer gets back to town.”
The Professors
Russell and Lemley have followed each other across the country since the early 1990s, co-writing articles and book chapters, and teaching classes together.
In 1994, Lemley received a bachelor’s degree from California State University at Chico, where Russell was an assistant professor and later an associate professor from 1990 until 1996, according to their respective curricula vitae posted on the Arkansas State Web site.
They then moved to Washington State University, where Lemley earned a master’s degree in criminal justice in 1998 and a doctorate in political science in 2004. Russell, meanwhile, was an associate professor of political science and criminal justice there from 1996 until 2002.
From Washington State, Russell and Lemley moved to Arkansas State, where Russell was an associate professor of criminology and director of the university’s programs in criminology and forensic science. Lemley began there as an instructor in 2002 but became an assistant professor upon completion of her doctorate.

http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/726/1222/188548/,"Dr. William E. Korf appeals the district court's decision granting summary judgment to the defendants in an action brought by Dr. Korf following his termination as a tenured Associate Professor of Music History and Musicology at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana. On appeal Dr. Korf argues that the entry of summary judgment was an improper denial of his due process and equal protection claims, and his challenge to the defendants' qualified immunity. Dr. Korf also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him the opportunity to conduct further discovery and in holding that the Eleventh Amendment provides defendants with immunity from prospective and injunctive relief. We AFFIRM. In February, 1981, Dr. Korf was informed by Lloyd Nelson, Dean of Ball State's College of Fine and Applied Arts, that certain of his current and former male students had accused him of sexual harassment. The students alleged that the harassment consisted of Dr. Korf's making unwelcomed sexual advances towards them and offering good grades contingent upon sexual involvement. Dean Nelson informed Dr. Korf that he intended to commence termination proceedings against him, and provided him the opportunity to resign. Dr. Korf denied the accusations and refused to resign. In accordance with established procedures, a committee was formed to investigate the charges. On April 2, 1981, the committee concluded that sufficient grounds existed to institute formal termination proceedings against Dr. Korf. The president of Ball State, Dr. Robert P. Bell, reviewed the committee's recommendation and informed Dr. Korf of the committee's findings. Based on those findings, on April 24, 1981, Dr. Bell told Dr. Korf that formal termination proceedings were being commenced and that he had the right to a hearing before an  hoc hearing committee, drawn from the University Senate Judicial Committee, to determine whether or not Dr. Korf should be removed from his position. Dr. Korf requested a hearing and the University complied with his request on May 20, 1981. At that hearing, a student related the relationship he had had with Dr. Korf and testified that Dr. Korf gave him money and gifts in exchange for sexual acts.  In addition, the student alleged that he was promised good grades. While denying that grades were involved, Dr. Korf admitted his sexual involvement with this student. The committee also heard testimony from three individuals and had statements of four other individuals who recounted Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards them while or after they were his students. On May 21, 1981, the committee made the following findings: ""Based on the evidence provided at the hearing on May 20, 1981, we find Dr. William E. Korf guilty of unethical conduct because he used his position and influence as a teacher to exploit students for his private advantage. The evidence indicates a pattern of behavior in which he frequently built a personal, friendly relationship, followed by sexual advances, often in his home. ""This pattern was evidenced by the testimony of six (6) witnesses who were either present or submitted signed statements ... and by two (2) individuals who made statements to the Affirmative Action Officer .... These eight (8) people are current or former students in one or more of Dr. Korf's classes. ""We find insufficient evidence to support the allegation that Dr. Korf encouraged dishonest academic conduct."" The committee based its finding that Dr. Korf engaged in unethical conduct on paragraph 2 of the American Association of University Professors (""AAUP"") Statement on Professional Ethics which was adopted by Ball State University in 1967 and published in its Faculty Handbook.  Even though the committee found Dr. Korf guilty of unethical conduct, they recommended only that Dr. Korf be placed on a three-year period of probation, rather than discharged, because they did not feel that he had been provided ""ample warning and opportunity for behavioral change."" Pursuant to established procedures, the Board of Trustees was presented with the hearing committee's report. After hearing arguments from University representatives and counsel for Dr. Korf on July 6, 1981, the Trustees agreed with the committee's finding of unethical conduct but refused to accept the committee's disciplinary recommendation of three years probation and directed that the committee's report and recommendations be returned to them for reconsideration. Upon reconsideration, the hearing committee, after a ""close re-examination of the statement of ethics in the Faculty Handbook "" and because of the realistic unenforceability of some of the proposed conditions of probation,  reversed its prior recommendation of probation and recommended that Dr. Korf be discharged from the University. Based upon this recommendation the Trustees terminated Dr. Korf's employment on July 24, 1981. Dr. Korf initiated this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on May 21, 1982, seeking both legal and equitable relief. The six-count complaint alleged violations of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process, equal protection, free speech, freedom of association, and privacy, along with state law claims for breach of his employment contract and infliction of emotional distress. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss alleging that: (1) they possessed immunity both under the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified immunity; (2) none of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights were violated; and (3) Dr. Korf's employment contract was not breached and his emotional distress claim was insufficient. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit from the President of the Ball State University Board of Trustees delineating the basis for Dr. Korf's termination. Attached to the affidavit was the transcript of the formal hearing and all the exhibits presented. On August 5, 1982, Dr. Korf moved for a continuance to allow him to respond to the defendants' motion to dismiss until after discovery. Alternatively, he moved for an enlargement of time to respond to the defendants' motion. The court granted his alternative motion. On March 11, 1983 the district court granted defendants summary judgment  on Dr. Korf's constitutional and state law claims.  The court concluded that Ball State University was an instrumentality of the State of Indiana for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore the University, its Board of Trustees and the individual defendants in their official capacities were immune from suit under Sec. 1983. Because the affidavits presented on Dr. Korf's behalf failed to provide any evidence sufficient to create a genuine question whether the individual defendants acted in bad faith, the court also ruled that the defendants were immune from Sec. 1983 liability under the doctrine of qualified or ""good faith"" immunity. The main question we must decide is whether or not the district court committed error in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Dr. Korf contends that since there were disputed issues of material fact concerning his substantive due process and equal protection claims, summary judgment was improper. Dr. Korf also argues that even if he has not created genuine issues of material fact regarding these constitutional claims, the trial court erred by failing to grant him sufficient time to conduct the necessary discovery to prove that the University's regulations were applied against him arbitrarily. Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment shall be granted if the record shows that ""there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" It is clear that the party moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d 292, 296 (7th Cir. 1983); Rose v. Bridgeport Brass Co., 487 F.2d 804 (7th Cir. 1973). ""For the purpose of determining whether any material fact remains disputed 'the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts ... must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.' "" Fitzsimmons v. Best, 528 F.2d 692, 694 (7th Cir. 1976) (quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 994, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962)). These inferences must, however, be reasonably drawn. Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d 102, 104 (7th Cir. 1983). ""To create a question of fact, an adverse party responding to a properly made and supported summary judgment motion must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.... A party may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleadings; similarly, a bare contention that an issue of fact exists is insufficient to raise a factual issue."" Id. at 105 (citations omitted). The existence of a factual dispute does not necessarily preclude summary judgment unless ""the disputed fact is outcome determinative under the governing law."" Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d  at 296. ""A material issue of fact is one that affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth."" Admiralty Fund v. Hugh Johnson  Co., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982). It is against this procedural background regarding the propriety of summary judgment that we must examine Dr. Korf's claims concerning the existence of material issues of fact relevant to his constitutional claims. Dr. Korf argues that the record contains issues of material fact as to ""whether he could have had adequate notice"" of Ball State's ""asserted prohibition of consensual sexual relations between faculty members and students."" Dr. Korf does not contend he was unaware of the University's proscription of unethical faculty conduct; rather, he argues that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics could not be reasonably interpreted to include what he labels ""consensual sexual relationships"" with students but which the Hearing Committee expressly found to be ""unethical behavior of exploiting students for his private advantage."" In support of his opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion, Dr. Korf failed to allege any specific facts which would tend to create a genuine issue challenging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics, paragraph 2, by his faculty peers on the Hearing Committee. While Dr. Korf argues that he was not ""adequately put on notice"" because he was the first Ball State University faculty member ever disciplined for conduct such as his or, for that matter, any unethical conduct, the only logical basis for this argument is that if another professor had previously been dismissed for conduct similar to his, Dr. Korf would have definitely known that his conduct would warrant discipline. The plaintiff-appellant has failed to cite any caselaw setting forth a constitutional requirement that such notice be provided to would-be offenders. Common sense, reason and good judgment should have made him cognizant of the fact that his conduct could and would be cause for termination. One cannot be heard to complain that it is somehow unfair to be the first one disciplined under a particular law, rule or regulation since if that were the case, no new law, rule or regulation could ever be enforced. Dr. Korf also alleges that other ""private and consensual"" faculty/student sexual relationships had occurred and were presently occurring at Ball State University and that no steps had ever been taken against the faculty members allegedly involved. This argument also misses the mark. First, despite Dr. Korf's repeated characterization of his conduct as ""private and consensual,"" the faculty Hearing Committee found that he engaged in unethical behavior by ""exploiting students for his private advantage."" Therefore, ""consensual"" sexual activity is not at issue as it does not concern a fact which is ""outcome determinative under the governing law."" Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d  at 296. In any event, while there is no evidence that the young student Dr. Korf admitted having a sexual relationship with did not consent to engage in sexual activity with him, Dr. Korf's conduct is not to be viewed in the same context as would conduct of an ordinary ""person on the street."" Rather, it must be judged in the context of the relationship existing between a professor and his students within an academic environment. University professors occupy an important place in our society and have concommitant ethical obligations. The AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics makes this clear: ""1.) The professor, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognizes the special responsibilities placed upon him.... ""2.) ... He demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor...."" Ball State University Faculty Handbook at II-7. Furthermore, the Committee heard evidence of Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards seven students who refused his advances. One student recounted how he had to be ""very assertive to get away from Dr. Korf's amorous advances."" Such conduct certainly cannot be characterized as consensual sexual activity. Second, even if such alleged relationships between other faculty and students were relevant, all Dr. Korf has done is make bare assertions of faculty-student sexual relationships without any detailed information, much less supporting affidavits or proof. He must set forth specific facts in order to create a genuine issue of fact. Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d  at 105. Dr. Korf further argues that it is significant that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics relied upon by the Board of Trustees as the basis for his termination does not make any reference to sexual conduct. While his observation that the statement does not specifically mention sexual conduct is correct,  his conclusion regarding the omission's significance is misplaced and is contrary to reason and common sense. As is the case with other laws, codes and regulations governing conduct, it is unreasonable to assume that the drafters of the Statement on Professional Ethics could and must specifically delineate each and every type of conduct (including deviant conduct) constituting a violation. Nor have we been cited any case reciting that the language of the Constitution requires such precision. "" [I]t is not feasible or necessary ... to spell out in detail all that conduct which will result in retaliation. The most conscientious of codes that define prohibited conduct of employees include 'catchall' clauses prohibiting employee 'misconduct,' 'immorality,' or 'conduct unbecoming.' "" Meehan v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822, 835 (D.C. Cir. 1968); modified, 425 F.2d 469 (D.C. Cir. 1969); aff'd en banc, 425 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1969). See also Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 158-162, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 1646-1648, 40 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1974) (statute authorizing removal or suspension of federal employees ""for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service"" is not vague or overbroad). The lack of specific reference to sexual conduct in the Statement on Professional Ethics does not bar its application to Dr. Korf's conduct. The Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees relied upon that portion of the AAUP Statement warning against ""any exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" in reaching their decision to terminate Dr. Korf. Dr. Korf argues that this portion of the statement only prohibits the use of student research or assistance in an improper manner because this portion of the statement ends by stating ""and acknowledges significant academic assistance from them."" Construing ""exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" to include Dr. Korf's conduct was entirely reasonable. The narrow construction Dr. Korf asks us to accept is contrary to the express language of the provision as it proscribes ""any exploitation of students"" rather than merely ""academic exploitation of students."" We agree with his academic peers on the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees in their application of this provision of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics to Dr. Korf's conduct. They were well-qualified to interpret the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as well as to determine what is and is not acceptable faculty conduct within an academic setting. Furthermore, while the Hearing Committee based their initial recommendation on the particular portion of the AAUP Statement barring ""exploitation of students ... for private advantage,"" they explained that they changed their recommendation after they undertook a ""close re-examination of the Statement of Ethics in the Faculty Handbook."" The pertinent paragraph of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics also states that a professor ""demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor."" It is patently clear that Dr. Korf's conduct was also inconsistent with this provision of the AAUP Statement. In sum, Dr. Korf's arguments merely consist of generalized allegations disparaging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement by the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees. Our examination of the record reveals no ""genuine issue of material fact"" precluding disposition of his substantive due process claim by summary judgment. When the record is viewed in the light most favorable to Dr. Korf, his bald allegations do not meet that standard of proof necessary to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he ""had adequate notice of the standard of conduct to which he was being held."" The facts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that he should have understood both the standards to which he was being held and the consequences of his conduct. Dr. Korf merely asserts that he was not afforded notice and thereby contends that an issue of fact exists. This assertion alone is ""insufficient to raise a factual issue."" Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d  at 105. Because of Dr. Korf's failure to allege any specific facts in support of his alleged lack of notice his substantive due process claim was ripe for summary judgment since ""there [was] no genuine issue as to any material fact ...."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We also agree with the conclusions of law reached by the district court regarding the substantive due process issue and the court's express finding that ""it cannot be seriously maintained that Dr. Korf's conduct was not clearly proscribed by University Regulations."" ""The claim that a person is entitled to 'substantive due process' means, as we understand the concept, that state action which deprives him of life, liberty, or property must have a rational basis--that is to say, the reason for the deprivation may not be so inadequate that the judiciary will characterize it as 'arbitrary.' "" Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, 492 F.2d 1, 3-4 (7th Cir. 1974). We have no difficulty whatsoever concluding that Dr. Korf's termination was not ""arbitrary"" since the reasons for his termination were adequate. The University's interpretation of the AAUP Statement was entirely reasonable and rationally related to the duty of the University to provide a proper academic environment. "" [A] University has a right, and indeed a duty, to take all reasonable and lawful measures to prevent activities which adversely intrude into the teaching process or which might adversely affect the University's image and reputation. It has a right to expect and demand the highest standards of personal behavior and teaching performance from its teachers and professors. It does not have to settle for less."" Naragon v. Wharton, 572 F. Supp. 1117, 1121 (M.D. La. 1983). (A university did not violate the constitutional rights of a graduate assistant when it changed her assignment from teaching to research after discovering that she had had a homosexual relationship with a student who was not in her classes.) We hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Dr. Korf's substantive due process claim. Dr. Korf's allegations contending that disputed issues of material fact exist which should have precluded summary judgment on his equal protection claim suffer the same infirmities as his allegations regarding his substantive due process claim. Simply put, his allegations when viewed in a light most favorable to him, do not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the University selectively enforced its regulations against him. Dr. Korf again incorrectly premises his arguments on involvement in ""consensual sexual relations"" and merely alleges selective enforcement without providing us with any specific facts to support that claim. We do not agree with Dr. Korf's argument that he was terminated for his untraditional sexual preferences, since he was in fact terminated for his unethical conduct in violation of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as a result of sexual advances toward his students. The record fails to even suggest that the University would hesitate to discharge a professor who acted in a manner similar to Dr. Korf but directed his or her advances towards students of the opposite sex rather than the same sex. Since Dr. Korf, ""neither asserted nor established the existence of any suspect classification or the deprivation of any fundamental constitutional right ... the only inquiry is whether the State's [action] is 'rationally related to the State's objective.' "" Harrah Independent School Dist. v. Martin, 440 U.S. 194, 199, 99 S. Ct. 1062, 1064, 59 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1979) (citation omitted, quoting Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 315, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 2568, 49 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1976)). Clearly, Ball State University's action in this instance was rationally related to its responsibility to establish and maintain high ethical standards within the University in order to maintain a proper academic environment. In this case we do not see any evidence of the ""intentional invidious discrimination by the state against persons similarly situated"" which the Equal Protection Clause exists to protect. Ciechon v. City of Chicago, 686 F.2d 511, 522-23 (7th Cir. 1982). We hold that Dr. Korf's equal protection claim has no legal or factual basis and that the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on this claim. Finally, Dr. Korf maintains that even if he did not present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to his equal protection claim, the district court abused its discretion in denying his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) motion for further discovery before responding to the University's motion for summary judgment.  Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure envisions a situation such as this where summary judgment is sought prior to the initiation of discovery.  ""Subsection (f) allows a party who 'has no specific material contradicting his adversary's presentation to survive a summary judgment motion if he presents valid reasons justifying his failure of proof.' "" Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., Inc., 703 F.2d 525, 527 (11th Cir. 1983) (quoting 10-A Wright, Miller,  Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2740 at 530 (2d ed. 1983)). In Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, 582 F.2d 1068 (7th Cir. 1978), our court quoted with approval the Eighth Circuit's reasoning on the showing required for a party to succeed in a Rule 56(f) motion: ""Rule 56(f) is not a shield that can be raised to block a motion for summary judgment without even the slightest showing by the opposing party that his opposition is meritorious. A party invoking its protections must do so in good faith by affirmatively demonstrating why he cannot respond to a movant's affidavits ... and how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact."" Id. at 1071 (emphasis added) (quoting Willmar Poultry Co. v. Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., 520 F.2d 289, 297 (8th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 915, 96 S. Ct. 1116, 47 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1976)). See also S.E.C. v. Spence  Green Chemical Co., 612 F.2d 896 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1082, 101 S. Ct. 866, 66 L. Ed. 2d 806 (1981); Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., Inc., 703 F.2d  at 527; Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2740 at 530. In his affidavit to the district court, Dr. Korf alleged that due to his lack of time to conduct discovery he was unable to set forth any specific facts to demonstrate that genuine issues for trial existed. He sought to commence discovery concerning: (1) "" [R]elevant University policy and practice with respect to the proper scope of University inquiry into the private sexual relationships of faculty members. (2) "" [W]hether the University has singled out plaintiff, charged with engaging in private and consensual homosexual relationships with University students, for harsher treatment than faculty members who have engaged in heterosexual relationships with University students."" These foregoing reasons for which Dr. Korf sought discovery are insufficient to warrant the provision of additional time to conduct discovery before responding to the University's summary judgment motion. If his allegations were true he certainly had ample time to allege sufficient specific facts and/or conduct. He failed to provide an adequate explanation to the court as to ""why he [could not] respond to [the University's] affidavits ...."" Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, 582 F.2d  at 1071. Furthermore, both of the reasons he sets forth in seeking discovery related to ""private sexual relationships."" Since the discharge of Dr. Korf was not predicated upon his engaging in ""private sexual relationships,"" but unethical conduct by exploiting students for his private advantage, such discovery is completely irrelevant to his equal protection claim and would amount to no more than a fishing expedition. The information sought by Dr. Korf would be of no value to him in rebutting the strong showing made by Ball State University that Dr. Korf was properly terminated from his tenured professor position at the University. The Supreme Court has recently reiterated that unnecessary, broad-ranging discovery is disruptive and that as a consequence insubstantial claims should be resolved by summary judgment. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817-18, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2738-39, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982). This language clearly applies to this appeal and we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dr. Korf's motion to conduct additional discovery. The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.

      Dr. William E. Korf appeals the district court's decision granting summary judgment to the defendants in an action brought by Dr. Korf following his termination as a tenured Associate Professor of Music History and Musicology at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana.  On appeal Dr. Korf argues that the entry of summary judgment was an improper denial of his due process and equal protection claims, and his challenge to the defendants' qualified immunity.  Dr. Korf also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him the opportunity to conduct further discovery and in holding that the Eleventh Amendment provides defendants with immunity from prospective and injunctive relief.  We AFFIRM.
    
    I.
    
      2
      In February, 1981, Dr. Korf was informed by Lloyd Nelson, Dean of Ball State's College of Fine and Applied Arts, that certain of his current and former male students had accused him of sexual harassment.  The students alleged that the harassment consisted of Dr. Korf's making unwelcomed sexual advances towards them and offering good grades contingent upon sexual involvement.  Dean Nelson informed Dr. Korf that he intended to commence termination proceedings against him, and provided him the opportunity to resign.  Dr. Korf denied the accusations and refused to resign.  In accordance with established procedures, a committee was formed to investigate the charges.  On April 2, 1981, the committee concluded that sufficient grounds existed to institute formal termination proceedings against Dr. Korf.
    
    
      3
      The president of Ball State, Dr. Robert P. Bell, reviewed the committee's recommendation and informed Dr. Korf of the committee's findings.  Based on those findings, on April 24, 1981, Dr. Bell told Dr. Korf that formal termination proceedings were being commenced and that he had the right to a hearing before an  hoc hearing committee, drawn from the University Senate Judicial Committee, to determine whether or not Dr. Korf should be removed from his position.  Dr. Korf requested a hearing and the University complied with his request on May 20, 1981.
    
    
      4
      At that hearing, a student related the relationship he had had with Dr. Korf and testified that Dr. Korf gave him money and gifts in exchange for sexual acts.   In addition, the student alleged that he was promised good grades.  While denying that grades were involved, Dr. Korf admitted his sexual involvement with this student.  The committee also heard testimony from three individuals and had statements of four other individuals who recounted Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards them while or after they were his students.
    
    
      5
      On May 21, 1981, the committee made the following findings:
    
    
      6
      ""Based on the evidence provided at the hearing on May 20, 1981, we find Dr. William E. Korf guilty of unethical conduct because he used his position and influence as a teacher to exploit students for his private advantage.  The evidence indicates a pattern of behavior in which he frequently built a personal, friendly relationship, followed by sexual advances, often in his home.
    
    
      7
      ""This pattern was evidenced by the testimony of six (6) witnesses who were either present or submitted signed statements ... and by two (2) individuals who made statements to the Affirmative Action Officer ....  These eight (8) people are current or former students in one or more of Dr. Korf's classes.
    
    
      8
      ""We find insufficient evidence to support the allegation that Dr. Korf encouraged dishonest academic conduct.""
    
    
      9
      The committee based its finding that Dr. Korf engaged in unethical conduct on paragraph 2 of the American Association of University Professors (""AAUP"") Statement on Professional Ethics which was adopted by Ball State University in 1967 and published in its Faculty Handbook.   Even though the committee found Dr. Korf guilty of unethical conduct, they recommended only that Dr. Korf be placed on a three-year period of probation, rather than discharged, because they did not feel that he had been provided ""ample warning and opportunity for behavioral change.""
    
    
      10
      Pursuant to established procedures, the Board of Trustees was presented with the hearing committee's report.  After hearing arguments from University representatives and counsel for Dr. Korf on July 6, 1981, the Trustees agreed with the committee's finding of unethical conduct but refused to accept the committee's disciplinary recommendation of three years probation and directed that the committee's report and recommendations be returned to them for reconsideration.  Upon reconsideration, the hearing committee, after a ""close re-examination of the statement of ethics in the Faculty Handbook "" and because of the realistic unenforceability of some of the proposed conditions of probation, reversed its prior recommendation of probation and recommended that Dr. Korf be discharged from the University.  Based upon this recommendation the Trustees terminated Dr. Korf's employment on July 24, 1981.
    
    
      11
      Dr. Korf initiated this action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on May 21, 1982, seeking both legal and equitable relief.  The six-count complaint alleged violations of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process, equal protection, free speech, freedom of association, and privacy, along with state law claims for breach of his employment contract and infliction of emotional distress.  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss alleging that:  (1) they possessed immunity both under the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified immunity;  (2) none of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights were violated;  and (3) Dr. Korf's employment contract was not breached and his emotional distress claim was insufficient.  The motion was accompanied by an affidavit from the President of the Ball State University Board of Trustees delineating the basis for Dr. Korf's termination.  Attached to the affidavit was the transcript of the formal hearing and all the exhibits presented.  On August 5, 1982, Dr. Korf moved for a continuance to allow him to respond to the defendants' motion to dismiss until after discovery.  Alternatively, he moved for an enlargement of time to respond to the defendants' motion.  The court granted his alternative motion.
    
    
      12
      On March 11, 1983 the district court granted defendants summary judgment on Dr. Korf's constitutional and state law claims.   The court concluded that Ball State University was an instrumentality of the State of Indiana for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore the University, its Board of Trustees and the individual defendants in their official capacities were immune from suit under Sec. 1983.  Because the affidavits presented on Dr. Korf's behalf failed to provide any evidence sufficient to create a genuine question whether the individual defendants acted in bad faith, the court also ruled that the defendants were immune from Sec. 1983 liability under the doctrine of qualified or ""good faith"" immunity.
    
    
      13
      The main question we must decide is whether or not the district court committed error in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  Dr. Korf contends that since there were disputed issues of material fact concerning his substantive due process and equal protection claims, summary judgment was improper.  Dr. Korf also argues that even if he has not created genuine issues of material fact regarding these constitutional claims, the trial court erred by failing to grant him sufficient time to conduct the necessary discovery to prove that the University's regulations were applied against him arbitrarily.
    
    II.
    
      14
      Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment shall be granted if the record shows that ""there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.""    It is clear that the party moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact.    Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d 292, 296 (7th Cir.1983);  Rose v. Bridgeport Brass Co., 487 F.2d 804 (7th Cir.1973).  ""For the purpose of determining whether any material fact remains disputed 'the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts ... must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.' ""    Fitzsimmons v. Best, 528 F.2d 692, 694 (7th Cir.1976) (quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962)).  These inferences must, however, be reasonably drawn.    Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d 102, 104 (7th Cir.1983).
    
    
      15
      ""To create a question of fact, an adverse party responding to a properly made and supported summary judgment motion must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial....  A party may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleadings;  similarly, a bare contention that an issue of fact exists is insufficient to raise a factual issue.""
    
    
      16
      Id. at 105 (citations omitted).  The existence of a factual dispute does not necessarily preclude summary judgment unless ""the disputed fact is outcome determinative under the governing law.""    Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d at 296.  ""A material issue of fact is one that affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth.""    Admiralty Fund v. Hugh Johnson  Co., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir.1982).  It is against this procedural background regarding the propriety of summary judgment that we must examine Dr. Korf's claims concerning the existence of material issues of fact relevant to his constitutional claims.
    
    III.
    A. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS
    
      17
      Dr. Korf argues that the record contains issues of material fact as to ""whether he could have had adequate notice"" of Ball State's ""asserted prohibition of consensual sexual relations between faculty members and students.""    Dr. Korf does not contend he was unaware of the University's proscription of unethical faculty conduct;  rather, he argues that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics could not be reasonably interpreted to include what he labels ""consensual sexual relationships"" with students but which the Hearing Committee expressly found to be ""unethical behavior of exploiting students for his private advantage.""
    
    
      18
      In support of his opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion, Dr. Korf failed to allege any specific facts which would tend to create a genuine issue challenging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics, paragraph 2, by his faculty peers on the Hearing Committee.  While Dr. Korf argues that he was not ""adequately put on notice"" because he was the first Ball State University faculty member ever disciplined for conduct such as his or, for that matter, any unethical conduct, the only logical basis for this argument is that if another professor had previously been dismissed for conduct similar to his, Dr. Korf would have definitely known that his conduct would warrant discipline.  The plaintiff-appellant has failed to cite any caselaw setting forth a constitutional requirement that such notice be provided to would-be offenders.  Common sense, reason and good judgment should have made him cognizant of the fact that his conduct could and would be cause for termination.  One cannot be heard to complain that it is somehow unfair to be the first one disciplined under a particular law, rule or regulation since if that were the case, no new law, rule or regulation could ever be enforced.
    
    
      19
      Dr. Korf also alleges that other ""private and consensual"" faculty/student sexual relationships had occurred and were presently occurring at Ball State University and that no steps had ever been taken against the faculty members allegedly involved.  This argument also misses the mark.  First, despite Dr. Korf's repeated characterization of his conduct as ""private and consensual,"" the faculty Hearing Committee found that he engaged in unethical behavior by ""exploiting students for his private advantage.""    Therefore, ""consensual"" sexual activity is not at issue as it does not concern a fact which is ""outcome determinative under the governing law.""    Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d at 296.  In any event, while there is no evidence that the young student Dr. Korf admitted having a sexual relationship with did not consent to engage in sexual activity with him, Dr. Korf's conduct is not to be viewed in the same context as would conduct of an ordinary ""person on the street.""    Rather, it must be judged in the context of the relationship existing between a professor and his students within an academic environment.  University professors occupy an important place in our society and have concommitant ethical obligations.  The AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics makes this clear:
    
    
      20
      ""1.) The professor, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognizes the special responsibilities placed upon him....
    
    
      21
      ""2.) ... He demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor....""
    
    
      22
      Ball State University Faculty Handbook at II-7.  Furthermore, the Committee heard evidence of Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards seven students who refused his advances.  One student recounted how he had to be ""very assertive to get away from Dr. Korf's amorous advances.""    Such conduct certainly cannot be characterized as consensual sexual activity.  Second, even if such alleged relationships between other faculty and students were relevant, all Dr. Korf has done is make bare assertions of faculty-student sexual relationships without any detailed information, much less supporting affidavits or proof.  He must set forth specific facts in order to create a genuine issue of fact.    Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d at 105.
    
    
      23
      Dr. Korf further argues that it is significant that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics relied upon by the Board of Trustees as the basis for his termination does not make any reference to sexual conduct.  While his observation that the statement does not specifically mention sexual conduct is correct, his conclusion regarding the omission's significance is misplaced and is contrary to reason and common sense.  As is the case with other laws, codes and regulations governing conduct, it is unreasonable to assume that the drafters of the Statement on Professional Ethics could and must specifically delineate each and every type of conduct (including deviant conduct) constituting a violation.  Nor have we been cited any case reciting that the language of the Constitution requires such precision.
    
    
      24
      ""[I]t is not feasible or necessary ... to spell out in detail all that conduct which will result in retaliation.  The most conscientious of codes that define prohibited conduct of employees include 'catchall' clauses prohibiting employee 'misconduct,' 'immorality,' or 'conduct unbecoming.' ""
    
    
      25
      Meehan v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822, 835 (D.C.Cir.1968);  modified, 425 F.2d 469 (D.C.Cir.1969);  aff'd en banc, 425 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1969).    See also Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 158-162, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 1646-1648, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974) (statute authorizing removal or suspension of federal employees ""for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service"" is not vague or overbroad).  The lack of specific reference to sexual conduct in the Statement on Professional Ethics does not bar its application to Dr. Korf's conduct.
    
    
      26
      The Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees relied upon that portion of the AAUP Statement warning against ""any exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" in reaching their decision to terminate Dr. Korf.  Dr. Korf argues that this portion of the statement only prohibits the use of student research or assistance in an improper manner because this portion of the statement ends by stating ""and acknowledges significant academic assistance from them.""    Construing ""exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" to include Dr. Korf's conduct was entirely reasonable.  The narrow construction Dr. Korf asks us to accept is contrary to the express language of the provision as it proscribes ""any exploitation of students"" rather than merely ""academic exploitation of students.""    We agree with his academic peers on the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees in their application of this provision of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics to Dr. Korf's conduct.  They were well-qualified to interpret the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as well as to determine what is and is not acceptable faculty conduct within an academic setting.  Furthermore, while the Hearing Committee based their initial recommendation on the particular portion of the AAUP Statement barring ""exploitation of students ... for private advantage,"" they explained that they changed their recommendation after they undertook a ""close re-examination of the Statement of Ethics in the Faculty Handbook.""    The pertinent paragraph of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics also states that a professor ""demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor.""    It is patently clear that Dr. Korf's conduct was also inconsistent with this provision of the AAUP Statement.
    
    
      27
      In sum, Dr. Korf's arguments merely consist of generalized allegations disparaging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement by the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees.  Our examination of the record reveals no ""genuine issue of material fact"" precluding disposition of his substantive due process claim by summary judgment.  When the record is viewed in the light most favorable to Dr. Korf, his bald allegations do not meet that standard of proof necessary to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he ""had adequate notice of the standard of conduct to which he was being held.""    The facts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that he should have understood both the standards to which he was being held and the consequences of his conduct.  Dr. Korf merely asserts that he was not afforded notice and thereby contends that an issue of fact exists.  This assertion alone is ""insufficient to raise a factual issue.""    Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d at 105.  Because of Dr. Korf's failure to allege any specific facts in support of his alleged lack of notice his substantive due process claim was ripe for summary judgment since ""there [was] no genuine issue as to any material fact ....""  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).
    
    
      28
      We also agree with the conclusions of law reached by the district court regarding the substantive due process issue and the court's express finding that ""it cannot be seriously maintained that Dr. Korf's conduct was not clearly proscribed by University Regulations.""
    
    
      29
      ""The claim that a person is entitled to 'substantive due process' means, as we understand the concept, that state action which deprives him of life, liberty, or property must have a rational basis--that is to say, the reason for the deprivation may not be so inadequate that the judiciary will characterize it as 'arbitrary.' ""
    
    
      30
      Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, 492 F.2d 1, 3-4 (7th Cir.1974).  We have no difficulty whatsoever concluding that Dr. Korf's termination was not ""arbitrary"" since the reasons for his termination were adequate.  The University's interpretation of the AAUP Statement was entirely reasonable and rationally related to the duty of the University to provide a proper academic environment.
    
    
      31
      ""[A] University has a right, and indeed a duty, to take all reasonable and lawful measures to prevent activities which adversely intrude into the teaching process or which might adversely affect the University's image and reputation.  It has a right to expect and demand the highest standards of personal behavior and teaching performance from its teachers and professors.  It does not have to settle for less.""
    
    
      32
      Naragon v. Wharton, 572 F.Supp. 1117, 1121 (M.D.La.1983).  (A university did not violate the constitutional rights of a graduate assistant when it changed her assignment from teaching to research after discovering that she had had a homosexual relationship with a student who was not in her classes.)    We hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Dr. Korf's substantive due process claim.
    
    B. EQUAL PROTECTION
    
      33
      Dr. Korf's allegations contending that disputed issues of material fact exist which should have precluded summary judgment on his equal protection claim suffer the same infirmities as his allegations regarding his substantive due process claim.  Simply put, his allegations when viewed in a light most favorable to him, do not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the University selectively enforced its regulations against him.  Dr. Korf again incorrectly premises his arguments on involvement in ""consensual sexual relations"" and merely alleges selective enforcement without providing us with any specific facts to support that claim.
    
    
      34
      We do not agree with Dr. Korf's argument that he was terminated for his untraditional sexual preferences, since he was in fact terminated for his unethical conduct in violation of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as a result of sexual advances toward his students.  The record fails to even suggest that the University would hesitate to discharge a professor who acted in a manner similar to Dr. Korf but directed his or her advances towards students of the opposite sex rather than the same sex.  Since Dr. Korf,
    
    
      35
      ""neither asserted nor established the existence of any suspect classification or the deprivation of any fundamental constitutional right ... the only inquiry is whether the State's [action] is 'rationally related to the State's objective.' ""
    
    
      36
      Harrah Independent School Dist. v. Martin, 440 U.S. 194, 199, 99 S.Ct. 1062, 1064, 59 L.Ed.2d 248 (1979) (citation omitted, quoting Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 315, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2568, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976)).  Clearly, Ball State University's action in this instance was rationally related to its responsibility to establish and maintain high ethical standards within the University in order to maintain a proper academic environment.  In this case we do not see any evidence of the ""intentional invidious discrimination by the state against persons similarly situated"" which the Equal Protection Clause exists to protect.    Ciechon v. City of Chicago, 686 F.2d 511, 522-23 (7th Cir.1982).  We hold that Dr. Korf's equal protection claim has no legal or factual basis and that the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on this claim.
    
    IV.
    
      37
      Finally, Dr. Korf maintains that even if he did not present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to his equal protection claim, the district court abused its discretion in denying his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) motion for further discovery before responding to the University's motion for summary judgment.   Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure envisions a situation such as this where summary judgment is sought prior to the initiation of discovery.
    
    
      38

      41
      ""Rule 56(f) is not a shield that can be raised to block a motion for summary judgment without even the slightest showing by the opposing party that his opposition is meritorious.  A party invoking its protections must do so in good faith by affirmatively demonstrating why he cannot respond to a movant's affidavits ... and how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.""

      In his affidavit to the district court, Dr. Korf alleged that due to his lack of time to conduct discovery he was unable to set forth any specific facts to demonstrate that genuine issues for trial existed.  He sought to commence discovery concerning:
    
    
      44
      (1) ""[R]elevant University policy and practice with respect to the proper scope of University inquiry into the private sexual relationships of faculty members.
    
    
      45
      (2) ""[W]hether the University has singled out plaintiff, charged with engaging in private and consensual homosexual relationships with University students, for harsher treatment than faculty members who have engaged in heterosexual relationships with University students.""
    
    
      46
      These foregoing reasons for which Dr. Korf sought discovery are insufficient to warrant the provision of additional time to conduct discovery before responding to the University's summary judgment motion.  If his allegations were true he certainly had ample time to allege sufficient specific facts and/or conduct.  He failed to provide an adequate explanation to the court as to ""why he [could not] respond to [the University's] affidavits ....""  Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, 582 F.2d at 1071.  Furthermore, both of the reasons he sets forth in seeking discovery related to ""private sexual relationships.""    Since the discharge of Dr. Korf was not predicated upon his engaging in ""private sexual relationships,"" but unethical conduct by exploiting students for his private advantage, such discovery is completely irrelevant to his equal protection claim and would amount to no more than a fishing expedition.  The information sought by Dr. Korf would be of no value to him in rebutting the strong showing made by Ball State University that Dr. Korf was properly terminated from his tenured professor position at the University.  The Supreme Court has recently reiterated that unnecessary, broad-ranging discovery is disruptive and that as a consequence insubstantial claims should be resolved by summary judgment.    Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817-18, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738-39, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  This language clearly applies to this appeal and we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dr. Korf's motion to conduct additional discovery.
    
    
      47
      The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.

MUNCIE, Ind. --  A Ball State University instructor accused by a woman student of making sexual advances was found dead in his car, an apparent suicide.
 The instructor, Sheldon H. Gurney, 46, apparently used a jar with cyanide and hydrochloric acid from his biology laboratory to turn his car into a gas chamber Thursday, investigators said. Emergency crew used protective equipment to guard themselves from the fumes when they took him from his car parked behind his house.

An autopsy was planned Friday to determine the exact cause and approximate time of death, Delaware County Coroner Jack Stonebraker Jr. said.
 Gurney's death came just three days after one of the chief reporters for the student-written Ball State Daily News, Rebecca Ward of DeMotte, wrote a bylined article telling how an instructor had helpfully rubbed her back and then moved from helpfulness to sexual fondling.
 She did not name Gurney in the Monday article but did file a protective order for herself against him Oct. 2 in Delaware Superior Court. 
 Ward was unavailable for comment after Gurney's death. She left town Thursday for her northern Indiana home, campus friends said.

 University police were continuing a criminal investigation of allegations that Gurney had committed sexual battery, Ball State University Capt. Robert Fey said.
 Ward did not allege she was raped. She wrote that her instructor had massaged her back and then moved his hands to her breasts. She said she froze, not knowing what to do. She had respected the man as a professor and did not want to anger him but found an excuse to flee the room.
 Her article generated letters to editor in the student newspaper about sexual harassment for several days afterward.
 'As a consequence of the article that appeared in the student newspaper on Monday, at least four other students came forward and charged that they were victims of similar behavior,' Jeffrey Alford, executive director of communications and publications for the university, said Friday.

https://casetext.com/case/webb-v-board-of-trustees-of-ball-state-university,"  JOHN DANIEL TINDER, U.S. District Judge   On August 4, 1997, the Plaintiffs, Gary L. Webb, Susan L. Sayles and Melissa L. Wisner, commenced this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Complaint alleged that Plaintiffs were subjected to sexual discrimination, harassment and retaliation, as well as violations of their Fourteenth Amendment and First Amendment rights. The Complaint also alleged that Defendants conspired to deny Plaintiffs' civil rights. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction which was denied by the court and affirmed on appeal. On January 5, 2000, the court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment in favor of all Defendants and against all Plaintiffs on all claims. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment in all respects. Thus, Defendants are prevailing parties in this litigation.   On January 31, 2000, Defendants filed their Petition For Attorneys' Fees And Motion For Sanctions, and on June 23, 2000, they filed their Verified And Amended Petition for Attorneys' Fees And Motion For Sanctions. Defendants seek an award of $103,629.33 in attorneys' fees or sanctions or some combination thereof against Plaintiffs Gary Webb and Melissa Wisner and their counsel, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and 28 U.S.C. § 1927.     Defendants originally sought attorney's fees against Plaintiff Susan Sayles, but have withdrawn their fee petition as against her and have reduced their original fee petition request of $155,444.00 by one-third, which they generously attribute to the defense of Plaintiff Sayles' claims. Because there was substantial overlap in the defense of the claims of the other Plaintiffs, however, less than one-third of the time expended was dedicated solely to Sayles' claims. Nevertheless, Defendants believed that the fairest approach was to reduce their fee petition by one-third.   Originally Defendants sought sanctions against counsel under Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but they have withdrawn that request.   I. Discussion A. Legal Standards In Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978), the Supreme Court held that under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k)  ""a district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case upon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith."" Id. at 421; see also Monroe v. Children's Home Ass'n, 128 F.3d 591, 594 (7th Cir. 1997) (defendants in Title VII action can recover attorney's fees if plaintiff's claim is frivolous). If a district court finds that a plaintiff brought or continued to litigate a Title VII claim in bad faith, ""there will be an even stronger basis for charging him with the attorney's fees incurred by the defense."" Id. at 422. A decision to award attorney's fees under Section 2000e-5(k) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Connolly v. Nat'l Sch. Bus Serv., Inc., 177 F.3d 593, 596-97.   In Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5 (1980), the Supreme Court adopted the Christianburg standard for imposition of attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, which allows the court in its discretion to award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party. Id. at 14-15. Prevailing plaintiffs are awarded attorney's fees as a matter of course, but prevailing defendants are to be awarded attorney's fees only if the plaintiff's claim was ""frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless."" Id. (quoting Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 422); see also Khan v. Gallitano, 180 F.3d 829, 837 (7th Cir. 1999). A showing of bad faith is not a prerequisite to an award of attorney's fees under § 1988. Munson v. Milwaukee Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 969 F.2d 266, 269 (7th Cir. 1992). Rather, ""the defendant must demonstrate that the plaintiff's action is `meritless in the sense that it is groundless or without foundation.'"" Id. (quoting Hughes, 449 U.S. at 14). ""[W]hen a civil rights suit is lacking in any legal or factual basis . . ., an award of fees to the defendant is clearly appropriate to deter frivolous filings and to ensure that the ability of the courts to remedy civil rights violations is not restricted by dockets crowded with baseless litigation."" Id. (quotation omitted). The court may consider a plaintiff's ability to pay when deciding whether to award attorneys fees under § 1988. Munson v. Friske, 754 F.2d 683, 697 (7th Cir. 1985). Like a fee award under § 2000e-5(k), an award of fees under § 1988 to a prevailing defendant is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and, therefore, is upheld unless ""no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court."" Id. (quotation omitted).    Section 1988 provides in relevant part: ""(b) In any action or proceeding to enforce . . . [ 42 U.S.C. § 1983] . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . ., a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."" 42 U.S.C. § 1988.   28 U.S.C. § 1927  authorizes the imposition of attorney's fees, costs and expenses against counsel who ""multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously."" Fin. Inv. Co. (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Geberit AG, 165 F.3d 526, 533 (7th Cir. 1998); see Kotsilieris v. Chalmers, 966 F.2d 1181, 1184 (7th Cir. 1992). Counsel acts unreasonably ""by engaging in a serious and studied disregard for the orderly process of justice,"" Walter v. Fiorenzo, 840 F.2d 427, 433 (7th Cir. 1988) (quotation omitted), or where a ""claim [is] without a plausible legal or factual basis and lacking in justification."" Id. (quotation omitted) (emphasis in Walter). ""In determining whether an attorney's actions were objectively unreasonable a court may infer intent from a total lack of factual or legal basis for a suit."" Id. ""`Vexatious' conduct involves either subjective or objective bad faith."" Pac. Dunlop Holdings, Inc. v. Barosh, 22 F.3d 113, 120 (7th Cir. 1994) (citing Kotsilieris, 966 F.2d at 1184). Extremely negligent conduct, like reckless and indifferent conduct satisfies the bad faith requirement. Id. (citing Kotsilieris, 966 F.2d at 1185). Pursing a path ""that a reasonably careful attorney would have known, after appropriate inquiry, to be unsound"" is objectively unreasonable and vexatious. Walter, 840 F.2d at 433-44. A district court may consider counsel's ability to pay when imposing § 1927 sanctions, but is not required to do so. See Fox Valley Const. Workers Fringe Ben. Funds v. Pride of Fox Masonry Expert Restorations, 140 F.3d 661, 667 (7th Cir. 1998). A decision to grant sanctions under § 1927 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Fin. Inv. Co., 165 F.3d at 530.     The statute provides that: ""Any attorney . . . who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct. Id.   The Walter court upheld a sanctions award for filing meritless claims against a defendant stating, ""Where a party files a baseless claim, which cannot be supported after four years of discovery and which previously has been identified as baseless as against three other defendants, sanctions are indeed appropriate."" Id. at 436.   B. Background  The Complaint names the Board of Trustees of Ball State University and 49 individuals as Defendants individually and in their official capacities as employees or agents of Ball State University. Members of the Board were Frank A. Bracken, Mary Lou Conrad, Chad A. Davis, Jeffrey H. Smulyan, Krishna A. Thomas, Thomas L. DeWeese, Hollis E. Hughes, Jr., Richard L. Moake, James W. Parks, Gregory A. Schenkel and Pennie M. Thomas. John Worthen was President of Ball State University, Warren Vander Hill was Provost and Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Ronald Johnstone was Dean of the College of Sciences and Humanities (the ""College""), Donald Van Meter and William Eidson were Associate Deans of the College, and Jon Moll was legal counsel to the Board and its agents. Wynola Richards was the Director of Affirmative Action and Assistant Provost until July 1, 1995. Chris Airriess was a faculty member and chair of the Academic Freedom and Ethics Committee (""AFE Committee""). Tom Lowe, Ramon A. Avila, Carla Earhart, Robert Hayes, Ann Henderson, Kyama Kabadaki, Tim Lyon, Donald Merten, Leslie Milner, Jerome Ulman, Arthur Wilson, and Judy Yardon were faculty members or employees of the University and members of the AFE Committee.   Sali Falling was the BSU Director of Affirmative Action beginning with the 1995-96 academic year. Paul Parkison was a member of the faculty and chair of the  hoc committee appointed by President Worthen to address Plaintiff Webb's complaints. Other members of the  hoc committee were Kay E. Hodson, Sue H. Whitaker, and R. Thomas Wright. James Hendricks was a faculty member and chair of the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology (the ""Department""). Jean Comley, Bryan Byers, Taiping Ho, and Michael F. Brown were faculty members of the Department. Norman Beck was the BSU Executive Director of Human Resources, Beverly Pitts was the Associate Provost, Joseph Wehner was the Director or Public Safety, and William McCune was the BSU controller. Alice Bennett was a faculty member and chair of the College's Promotion and Tenure Appeals Committee, Robert South was a faculty member and chair of the University Promotion and Tenure Committee. Terrance Aldridge was a BSU student and reporter for the BSU Daily News. Mike McCAuley was the BSU Director of Academic Systems.   Count I alleges Plaintiff Webb's cause of action for sexual harassment under Title VII against the Board. Count II alleges Webb's cause of action for retaliation under Title VII against the Board. Count III alleges Webb's Section 1983 claim premised upon violations of the Fourteenth and First Amendments against the Board and all individual Defendants with the exception of Defendant South. Count IV alleges a conspiracy to deny Webb's civil rights in violation of Section 1983 against all Defendants, again with the exception of Defendant South.   Count IX alleges Plaintiff Wisner's cause of action for sexual discrimination under Title VII against the Board. Count X alleges Wisner's cause of action for retaliation under Title VII against the Board. Count XI alleges her cause of action for denial of civil rights under Section 1983 against the Defendant Board and Defendants Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, Thomas, Worthen, Vander Hill, Johnstone, Moll, Falling, Hendricks, Comley, Byers, Ho, Brown, Beck, Wehner, and McCauley. Count XII alleges a conspiracy to violate Wisner's civil rights against these same Defendants.   C. Application  In general response to Defendants' petition for attorneys' fees, Plaintiffs argue that before filing the Complaint in this case, Plaintiffs' counsel heard Plaintiffs' recitation of the facts relating to their claims and was provided with voluminous records upon which to base their claims, all of which established that ""allegations of bad faith were reasonably made and that the complaint was not groundless in law or fact."" (Pls.' Resp. Defs.' Pet. Fees at 8.) But improper motive, if an element of Plaintiffs' claims, is only one element. A pre-filing inquiry which causes counsel to conclude that Plaintiffs have evidentiary support for only a single element of a claim or claims is not enough to warrant assertion of those claims in a legal action. A reasonable inquiry requires counsel to consider all elements of all claims and then determine that there likely is evidentiary support for all elements. Interestingly, though, Plaintiffs do not argue that counsel concluded that allegations respecting other elements of the claims asserted were reasonably made and grounded in fact. Furthermore, the representation that counsel based the allegations of the Complaint upon Plaintiffs' recitation of ""facts"" and voluminous records provided by them fails to reflect that counsel engaged in an adequate prefiling investigation into the applicable law.   Plaintiffs claim that they did not have the benefit of discovery and argue that Defendants would have resisted any efforts to be subjected to discovery since they asserted a qualified immunity defense. The latter is speculative. As to the former, though Plaintiffs may not have engaged in formal discovery recognized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, they did have the benefit of discovery through the preliminary injunction hearing, and Plaintiffs' were allowed to supplement their responses to Defendants' dispositive motions following the conclusion of that hearing. Plaintiffs assert they assumed they were unable to take discovery before the May 4, 1998, decision in Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598 (1998) (dicta suggesting that courts in their discretion may permit discovery against official asserting qualified immunity defense), and by that time the district court had ordered a stay of the proceedings. Plaintiffs fail to acknowledge that the stay was entered upon Plaintiffs' motion seeking a stay of the proceedings pending disposition of their appeal of the court's ruling on their motion for preliminary injunction. In addition, the court stayed all proceedings except for pleadings seeking a dissolution of the stay. (Entry Granting Pls.' Mot. Stay Proceedings, 2/11/98 at 1.) Plaintiffs did not seek any relief from the stay during the pendency of their appeal; rather, they waited until the court of appeals affirmed this court's ruling and then waited over six months after that before moving to lift the stay.   Plaintiff Webb, along with Susan Sayles, filed their first suit against Ball State in 1997. Ball State removed the case to federal court where it was assigned Cause No. IP 97-0221-C-M/S. Plaintiffs moved to remand, Judge McKinney concluded that he likely had subject matter jurisdiction because the case raised a federal question, and Plaintiffs dismissed the case. Approximately six months later, Plaintiffs filed this action. Defendants argue that given Mr. Dowling's comments at the remand hearing to Judge McKinney that ""I have no interest in being in this Court. I don't want to be in this Court. I didn't ask for this Court because I want the state law to give me a remedy in this case"" (Defs.' App. Evid. Mats., Ex. B, Tr. at 25), the filing of this action later that same year arguably might have been a vexatious multiplication of proceedings. Defendants, however, cite no authority to support their argument. The court declines to sanction Plaintiffs for bringing a subsequent action after expressing a preference for a state forum for similar if not identical claims and issues.   1. Title VII Claims  Defendants contend the Title VII claims were inconsistent with the EEOC charges upon which they were based or lacking in any evidentiary support. Long before the Complaint was filed it was well-settled that a plaintiff could not bring Title VII claims not included in his or her EEOC Charge. See Cheek v. W. S. Life Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1994); Rush v. McDonald's Corp., 966 F.2d 1104, 1110 (7th Cir. 1992); Babrocky v. Jewel Food Co., 773 F.2d 857, 863 (7th Cir. 1985). Count I, ""Plaintiff Webb's Cause of Action for Sexual Harassment,"" asserted that Webb was subjected to sexual harassment. The sex discrimination box is checked on Webb's first EEOC charge, but the body of the charge contains no allegations pertaining to a sex discrimination or harassment claim. The Seventh Circuit has not addressed whether merely checking the box on the charge form without making particular allegations in the body of the charge suffices to include a claim within the scope of the EEOC charge. The court concluded that checking the box for ""sex"" discrimination alone does not suffice to bring a sexual harassment claim within the scope of the EEOC charge. However, given the absence of controlling precedent, the court finds that Webb's assertion of a sexual harassment claim is not sanctionable. Defendants also urge that Webb's sexual harassment claim ignored clear precedent that such a claim cannot be based upon an allegation arising from the ending of a consensual relationship, citing Huebschen v. Dep't of Health Soc. Servs., 716 F.2d 1167 (7th Cir. 1983). That decision, however was decided under the Equal Protection clause and therefore was not clearly binding precedent as the Defendants urge. The court does not find that the bringing of Webb's sexual harassment claim warrants sanctions.   Wisner's sex discrimination claim under Title VII is well beyond the scope of her EEOC charges, however. Plaintiffs argue that EEOC intake officers rather than they drafted the EEOC charges, implying that this should entitle them to an exception to the rule regarding the scope of an EEOC charge. No authority is offered to support this argument, which is nothing other than an attempt to shift the blame to the EEOC and will not be condoned. Given that Webb is highly educated with a Ph.D. and accumulated several credits in law school and Wisner has a college degree, as well as the fact that all Plaintiffs assisted each other in preparing their EEOC charges, the argument is frivolous and patently unreasonable given the Plaintiffs' high levels of education and coordinated efforts in preparing their EEOC charges. Therefore, Wisner's sex discrimination claim ignores the well-settled scope of the charge doctrine. It therefore is sanctionable under § 2000e-5(k).   Wisner's sex discrimination claim against the Board is subject to sanctions for another fundamental reason. The Complaint alleges that various Defendants took certain actions against her and the Board ""had knowledge of the facts alleged and acquiesced in the conduct of its employees and agents as described above."" (Id. ¶ 52.) ""A complaint which consists of conclusory allegations unsupported by factual assertions fails even the liberal standard of Rule 12(b)(6)."" Palda v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 47 F.3d 872, 875 (7th Cir. 1995); see Cushing v. City of Chicago, 3 F.3d 1156, 1167 (7th Cir. 1993). This allegation against the Board is vague, conclusory and unsupported by factual assertions. Wisner therefore fails to state a Title VII sex discrimination claim in the Complaint against the Board and, moreover, the bringing of this frivolous claim is sanctionable under § 2000e-5(k).   With respect to Webb's Title VII retaliation claim, Defendants argue that Webb ignored clear Seventh Circuit precedent that defined an adverse action ""as something substantially more than anything he claimed."" (Mem. Supp. Defs.' Pet. at 18.) Webb argued, however, that even if each alleged act on its own did not constitute an adverse action, all of the acts ""taken as a whole"" constituted an adverse action against him. The court concluded that even when taken as a whole, the acts about which Webb complained were not materially adverse actions. Nevertheless, his argument reasonably could be considered a nonfrivolous argument for the extension or a modification of the law.   Defendants argue that Webb's retaliation claim is sanctionable because it was clear he could not establish the necessary causal link between protected activity and the allegedly adverse employment actions. The claimed protected activity was the filing of an EEOC charge on September 21, 1995. (Compl., Ex. 2 at 1-2.) Webb's only ""evidence"" and argument for the causal link was the time period between the filing of the charge and the alleged retaliatory acts. (Pls.' Resp. Defs.' Mots. Dismiss Summ. J. at 39.) The earliest alleged adverse action occurred in December 1996; the others occurred even more remote in time. The passage of time between this earliest action-coming more than 14 months after the protected activity-was far greater than periods of time which the Seventh Circuit has held insufficient evidence of a causal link. See, e.g., Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7th Cir. 1992) (4 months insufficient); Juarez v. Ameritech Mobile Comm., Inc., 957 F.2d 317, 321 (7th Cir. 1992) (6 months insufficient). Plaintiffs did not provide any arguments as to why a much lengthier time period should be able to raise an inference of a causal link, rather than serve as counter-evidence of causation. Had they and counsel done their homework before filing suit, they would have known that the remoteness of the alleged adverse acts to the protected activity alone could not support the causation element of a retaliation claim. Further, once this was brought to their attention through Defendants' dispositive motions, Plaintiffs should have conceded the lack of a plausible legal basis for Webb's retaliation claim and dismissed it. They did not do so, forcing the court to address the claim in its entry and thus justifying imposition of sanctions under § 2000e-5(k).   As for Wisner's retaliation claim, the court concluded that a retaliation claim stemming from her transfer was within the scope of her third EEOC charge and that her transfer was arguably an adverse action. The court ultimately concluded that Plaintiffs failed to come forward with sufficient evidence that she suffered a materially adverse employment action because they failed to prove that her transfer was something other than a lateral transfer and that she had the same level of material responsibility. But Plaintiffs offered evidence that in her new position Wisner lacked a supervisory position over students which she had in her administrative position in the Department. Thus, it cannot be said that Wisner's retaliation claim based on her transfer was frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation even though Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on that claim.    Defendants contend Plaintiffs should be sanctioned for naming 49 Defendants in their individual capacity without alleging or offering any facts to support individual capacity claims. Defendants also contend that most of the Defendants, though they do not specifically identify them by name, never took any action against Plaintiffs but rather served on committees or boards that did not do what Plaintiffs wanted. Suit against public officials in their individual capacities ""can be abusive, in some cases, and, where appropriate, [can] subject plaintiffs and their counsel to sanctions . . . especially where such defendants are forced to hire separate counsel in their individual capacity or are subjected, as individuals, to vexatious litigation."" Scott v. Flowers, 910 F.2d 201, 213 n. 25 (5th Cir. 1990); see also Latimore v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 151 F.3d 712, 716 (7th Cir. 1998) (warning that ""this court does not look with favor on the promiscuous joinder of minor employees as defendants in cases against their employers.""); Anderson v. County of Montgomery, 111 F.3d 494, 502 (7th Cir. 1997) (affirming sanctions for dragging a number of defendants into suit without legal or factual merit), overruled on other grounds by DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d 607 (7th Cir. 2000). But none of the defendants sued in their individual capacities, save Richards, hired separate counsel to defend against the individual capacity claims, which may weigh against finding that the claims against them in their individual capacities was abusive, see, Scott, 910 F.2d at 213 n. 25.    Defendants would have better assisted the court in considering their petition had they named those Defendants.   Defendants argue that the naming as Defendants the members of the AFE Committee (Defendants Airriess, Loew, Avila, Earhart, Hayes, Henderson, Kabadaki, Lyon, Merten, Milner, Ulman, Wilson and Yardon), the  hoc committee (Defendants Parkison, Hodson, Whitaker and Wright), University Controller McCune, campus police chief Wehner, and University attorney Moll was purely to harass and intimidate the Ball State administration. The only actions the AFE Committee took against Webb was to investigate Cotlar's complaint against him, find in Cotlar's favor and recommend that Webb be reprimanded. The Provost, however overruled that recommendation and Webb was not reprimanded. Thus, Webb failed to allege or prove the denial of any property interest by the AFE Committee. As for the  hoc committee, which President Worthen appointed to investigate the concerns raised in Webb's manifesto, that committee interviewed Webb and other witnesses and then issued a report containing three possible solutions, including Webb's removal as Department Chair. Webb did not lose his position as Chair as a result of the  hoc committee's recommendations. Thus, Webb failed to allege or prove the denial of any property interest by the  hoc committee. The court concludes that Webb's § 1983 claims against the AFE Committee and the  hoc committee premised upon an alleged denial of a due process property right warrant sanctions under § 1988 because they are frivolous, unreasonable and lacking in any legal or factual basis.   Plaintiffs did move to dismiss Defendant McCune after the filing of Defendants' motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment, as they should have. (Pls.' Suppl. Resp. Defs.' Mots. Dismiss Summ. J. Mem. Supp. at 14.) In light of this, the court declines to sanction them for bringing claims against McCune.   As for Defendant Wehner, Webb alleged that he received parking tickets from campus police officers ""supervised by defendant WEHNER"" ""for parking in a parking lot . . . at which [he] had authorization to park."" (Compl. ¶ 35(F).) He also alleged that Wisner contacted agents of Wehner, explained the facts and was told that the tickets were removed (id.), and that ""Defendant WEHNER, with knowledge of these facts, intentionally and in bad faith refused to remedy the situation, causing plaintiff to be financially liable without just cause and without due process[.]"" (Id.) Similarly, Wisner alleged that she received unjustified parking tickets from the BSU Department of Public Safety ""under the supervision of defendant WEHNER"" for parking in a lot for which she had a permit, which was ""on information and belief, known to and acquiesced in, by defendant WEHNER."" Compl. ¶ 49(G)(1).) These allegations, though Minimal, are sufficient to state a claim against Wehner in his individual capacity by claiming that the ""conduct causing the [alleged] constitutional deprivation occur[ed] . . . with [his] knowledge and consent."" McPhaul v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 226 F.3d 558, 566 (7th Cir. 2000), petition for cert. filed, No. 00-1144 (U.S. Jan. 16, 2001); see Gentry v. Duckworth, 65 F.3d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1995). It is true, however, that Plaintiffs never offered any evidence that the issuance of the parking tickets or refusal to remove them was done with Wehner's knowledge and consent. Nor did they offer any other evidence upon which Wehner otherwise could be held individually liable for the alleged constitutional deprivation related to the parking tickets, i.e., that Wehner acted or failed to act with a deliberate or reckless disregard of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, or that the conduct causing the constitutional deprivation occurred at his direction, see, e.g., McPhaul, 226 F.3d at 566; Gentry, 65 F.3d at 561. Thus, the continued prosecution of the claims against Defendant Wehner justifies the imposition of sanctions under § 1988.   Webb alleged that Attorney Moll authored or reviewed for content the reports of the  hoc committee and the AFE Committee. (Compl. ¶ 32, 34(C)(6).) These allegations are sufficient to allege Moll's personal responsibility for the alleged constitutional deprivation related to these reports. However, Plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that either report resulted in any action being taken against Webb. Again, the prosecution of these claims against Moll warrants the imposition of sanctions under § 1988.   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to allege or prove any facts suggesting the Board Trustees acted in bad faith or with conscious disregard of established constitutional rights and moreover, that there was no allegation or evidence that any Trustee took any action at all against Plaintiffs. Thus, Defendants argue the individual capacity claims against the Trustees were an attempt to harass and intimidate them. However, the Complaint does contain allegations that, when read liberally in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, state a claim against the Trustees individually. As for Webb, the Complaint alleges that the Board of Trustees ""is . . . empowered to determine their [BSU employees'] compensation and conditions of employment,"" (Compl. ¶ 4); after Webb filed appeals of the AFE Committee's decision, the Board refused ""to remedy the situation,"" (id. ¶ 33); that during the appeals process Webb received a pay raise ""that was below average and the lowest of all BSU department chairs,"" (id. ¶ 34(A)); the Board failed to respond to Webb's appeals, with the exception of a letter referring his complaint to President Worthen, (id. ¶ 35); the Board refused to give Webb a copy of Defendant Ho's complaint against Webb, (id. ¶ 35(D)); and the Board ""had knowledge of the facts surrounding plaintiff's refusal to restore said relationship [with Richards] and failed to remedy and prevent the injuries, losses, and deprivations suffered by the plaintiff as a result thereof."" (Compl. ¶ 42.) When the Complaint's allegations are read in their entirety and construed generously in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, with these allegations Webb has stated a claim that the ""conduct causing the [alleged] constitutional deprivation[s] occur[ed] . . . with [the Trustees'] knowledge and consent."" McPhaul, 226 F.3d at 566; see Gentry v. Duckworth, 65 F.3d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1995). The allegations also allege that the Trustees took actions (or failed to act) against Webb.   As for Wisner, however, the Complaint wholly fails to make any allegation against the individual Trustees which would support an individual capacity claim against them. There is no allegation that any conduct causing an alleged constitutional deprivation to Wisner occurred with a Trustee's knowledge and consent. Nor is there any allegation that any Trustee took any action or failed to take an action against her. Therefore, the bringing of the Section 1983 individual capacity claims against the Trustees individually by Wisner is subject to sanctions under § 1988.   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims are sanctionable because Plaintiffs failed to plead any facts to suggest an agreement among Defendants to violate Plaintiffs' rights and Plaintiffs never offered any evidence of such an agreement. ""At a minimum, a complaint must contain facts sufficient to state a claim as a matter of law, and mere conclusory allegations of a conspiracy are insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss."" Fries v. Helsper, 146 F.3d 452, 457 (7th Cir. 1998) (citing House v. Belford, 956 F.2d 711, 721 (7th Cir. 1992)).   Webb brought his § 1983 conspiracy claim against all Defendants with the exception of South. Wisner alleged a § 1983 conspiracy against the Defendants Board, Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, K. Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, P. Thomas, Worthen, Vander Hill, Johnstone, Moll, Falling, Hendricks, Comley, Byers, Ho, Brown, Beck, Wehner, and McCauley. The Complaint lacks any factual allegation of a conspiracy or agreement between Defendants to violate Plaintiffs' rights. The Complaint then alleges in conclusory fashion that ""defendants . . . committed the foregoing acts and omissions in concert and as part of a conspiracy to deprive Plaintiff WEBB of his rights . . . in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983"" (Compl. ¶ 40) and ""defendants . . . committed the foregoing acts and omissions in concert and as part of a conspiracy to deprive Plaintiff WISNER of her rights . . . in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983."" (Id. ¶ 51.) Even when Plaintiffs are given the benefit of the doubt of their conclusory allegations, the Complaint nevertheless fails to make a specific allegation that the following Defendants entered into an agreement or conspiracy against Webb: the Board, Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, K. Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, P. Thomas, Van Meter, Eidson, Avila, Earhart, Hayes, Henderson, Kabadaki, Lyon, Merten, Milner, Ulman, Wilson, Yardon, Falling, Parkison, Hoson, Whitaker, Wright, Hendricks, Comley, Byers, Ho, Brown, Pitts, Wehner, McCune and Aldridge; or that the following Defendants entered into a conspiracy or agreement against Wisner: Board, Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, K. Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, P. Thomas, Moll, Falling, Wehner, and McCauley. Thus, the conspiracy claims against said Defendants by Webb and Wisner are sanctionable under § 1988.    For Webb's conspiracy claim, the Complaint alleges that Cotlar conspired with Bennett to file a false complaint against Webb with the AFE Committee (Compl. ¶ 30); that Moll conspired with Johnstone, Vander Hill, Richards, Airriess and Lowe to draft the AFE Committee decision against Webb (id. ¶ 32); that Vander Hill, Richards, Johnstone and Moll conspired to draft or modify the  hoc committee's decision (id. ¶ 34(C); that Beck, Vander Hill conspired to disrupt the Department and make it difficult for Webb to perform his duties as chairperson (id. ¶ 35(E)); and that Johnstone and McCauley conspired to deny Webb computer access, (id. ¶ 35(G)). For Wisner's conspiracy claim, the Complaint alleges that Ho, Hendricks, Brown, Byers, Comley, Beck, Worthen, Vander Hill and Johnstone in concert had a series of interactions with Department personnel resulting in unjustified written criticisms of Wisner and other retaliatory acts (Compl. ¶ 49); and Beck conspired with Vander Hill to transfer Wisner to a new job, (id. ¶ 49(E)).   Furthermore, the only evidence offered to support the conspiracy claim in response to Defendants' dispositive motion was a paragraph in Webb's affidavit that: ""The behavior of Jim Hendricks, Bryan Byers, Michael Brown, Jean Comley, and Taiping Ho during the fall semester of 1996, made it very clear that they had met with Provost Vander Hill or his subordinate, Dean Johnstone."" (Webb Aff. 12/24/97 ¶ 30.) This statement is conclusory and fails to provide specific facts to establish an agreement or conspiracy among Defendants, let alone a conspiracy to violate Plaintiffs' rights. As the court observed previously, at best this statement would support a finding that certain Defendants met with Vander Hill or Johnstone; it does not address the purpose or outcome of any such meetings. (See Entry Regarding Pending Mots. at 23-24 n. 7.)   Plaintiffs respond that testimony was presented at the preliminary injunction hearing of meetings Johnstone and Vander Hill had with some of Webb's adversaries in the Department, citing Tr. Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 211-17 (Vander Hill testified he met in February 1995 with Richards and Meagher regarding the Meagher matter; he met with Steve about Webb; he met with Byers about studying in Oxford; he met with Cotlar; he met with Michael Brown regarding his teaching, a teaching loan, some concerns he had over research and concerns he had about the department unrelated to Webb), 480-81 (Johnstone testified that he was contacted by Drs. Ho, Byers and Hendricks in the fall of 1996 regarding Webb and the mistreatment of Dr. Ho), such that the conspiracy allegations were not totally groundless. Plaintiffs further argue discovery was necessary to determine the exact nature of the meetings and their relationship to the events which followed them. Even if Vander Hill's testimony arguably supported a conspiracy claim against some Defendants, the only Defendants about which Vander Hill testified he met on any matter were Johnstone, Byers, Cotlar, Brown, Ho and Hendricks. Absolutely no evidence was presented to support a conspiracy claim against other Defendants; thus, such claims have no basis in fact.    This individual is not identified by last name or position.   Defendants next argue that many of them were sued under § 1983 despite that the facts pled alleged conduct clearly outside the limitations period. Bringing and pursuing claims that are clearly foreclosed by precedent such as a statute of limitations can be sanctionable conduct. See Fred A. Smith Lumber Co. v. Edidin, 845 F.2d 750, 752-54 (7th Cir. 1988) (counsel pretended potentially dispositive authority did not exist; persisted in putting forth claims despite fact that statute of limitations clearly barred claims; and acted in bad faith in filing a fraud claim in hopes that future discovery would lead to sufficient facts to support such a claim); Hamilton v. Daley, 777 F.2d 1207, 1212-13 (7th Cir. 1985). It is well-established that in § 1983 civil rights actions the applicable limitations period is borrowed from state tort law, Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261 (1984); Venters v. City of Delphi, 123 F.3d 956, 967 (7th Cir. 1997), which in Indiana is two years, see Venters, 123 F.3d at 967. The Complaint was filed on August 4, 1997. Plaintiffs sued the following individual Defendants, alleging only acts or omissions against them that occurred before August 4, 1995: Airriess, Lowe, Alvila, Earhart, Hayes, Henderson, Kabadaki, Lyon, Merten, Milner, Ulman, Wilson, Yardon, Van Meter, Eidson and McCune.    Given Defendants' reliance on § 1983 case law, the court understands them to be directing this stale claim argument to the § 1983 claims against the individual Defendants.   Plaintiffs respond that they were entitled to allege that the acts of Defendants were continuing violations. Courts have been reluctant to apply the continuing violation theory outside the Title VII context. See Tolbert v. Oh. Dep't of Transp., 172 F.3d 934 (6th Cir. 1999); McGregor v. La. State Univ. Bd. of Supervisors, 3 F.3d 850 (5th Cir. 1993). One Seventh Circuit case has applied the theory in the § 1983 context, see Palmer v. Bd. of Educ., 46 F.3d 682 (7th Cir. 1995), though in a drastically different factual situation. That case considered whether an allegedly racially discriminatory school closing plan constituted a continuing violation. The school district had two high schools: one was predominantly African-American, the other was predominantly Caucasian. The district closed the former and bussed the students to the latter. Parents of an African-American student sued three years later, and Defendants argued the suit was untimely. Id. at 683. In holding that the claim was not time-barred, the court reasoned that each year the school board decided which school to use and which children were assigned to which school. The court continued: ""each year's decision to leave the building shuttered is a new violation. . . ."" Id. at 686.   One district court has held the theory applicable in a § 1983 action where the plaintiff, a prison physician, sued three corrections officials alleging that they engaged in a conspiracy to retaliate against him for exercising his First Amendment rights. See Allen v. Iranon, 99 F. Supp.2d 1216, 1239 (D.Hawaii 1999). The court found that the defendants had a mutual understanding to harass the plaintiff in retaliation for his exercise of his free speech rights and that all allegations against the defendants were sufficiently related to constitute a continuing violation. Id.; but see DeGrassi v. City of Glendora, 207 F.3d 636, 644-45 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding former city council member's § 1983 claim based upon alleged continuing campaign to interfere with her First Amendment rights and destroy her political reputation and career was not saved by continuing violation theory where plaintiff alleged ""a long-standing state of animosity and hostility, marked by incidents of personal conflict between her and other City officials"" but did not show a series of related wrongful acts). Neither the Seventh Circuit nor the Supreme Court has addressed whether the continuing violation theory is applicable in a § 1983 claim alleging a series of related wrongful acts. Because this area of the law is not settled and there is at least some support in the Allen case for Plaintiffs' position, Plaintiffs' § 1983 claims (including the conspiracy claims) are not sanctionable due to staleness, see Vandenplas v. City of Muskego, 797 F.2d 425, 430-31 (7th Cir. 1986) (claims are not likely to be frivolous if the state of the applicable law is unclear or in flux).   Defendants contend that Webb sued student newspaper reporter Terrance Aldridge alleging an article he wrote was defamatory and a constitutional tort even though the claim was foreclosed by Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693 (1976). Defendants maintain that counsel should have know the claim was foreclosed before filing suit and, then when confronted with Defendants' motion to dismiss, should have dismissed the claim. They argue that by failing to dismiss the claim, Plaintiffs unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings. In response, Plaintiffs argue that Webb's affidavit of January 22, 1998, contained evidence that Aldridge had met with certain university administrators, suggesting his involvement in the conspiracy and that the newspaper article was defamatory because it alleged immoral conduct. Plaintiffs once again miss the point and ignore controlling precedent.   In Paul v. Davis, the Supreme Court held that one's reputation alone, apart from a tangible interest such as employment, is not a property or liberty interest entitled to due process protection. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701 (1976). The Complaint alleged that Defendant Aldridge deprived Webb of property and liberty in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the First Amendment. (Compl., Count III ¶ 39 and Count IV ¶ 39.) Under the well-settled precedent of Paul, the allegations against Aldridge failed to state a claim for a deprivation of due process: The Complaint merely alleged that Aldridge defamed Webb and that Webb suffered an injury to his reputation and mental distress (id.); the Complaint did not allege that the injury to Webb's reputation accompanied a deprivation of any tangible interest such as employment. Because the Complaint failed to allege that Aldridge deprived Webb of a federally protected interested, it failed to state a § 1983 claim against Aldridge, see Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 393 (1989). Since an actual deprivation of federally protected rights is an essential element of a § 1983 civil conspiracy claim, see Scherer v. Balkema, 840 F.2d 437, 442 (7th Cir. 1988), the Complaint failed to state a § 1983 conspiracy claim against Aldridge, even if Plaintiffs' had some evidence that Aldridge met with certain university administrators.   Had Plaintiffs' counsel undertaken a reasonable investigation into the law, they would have discovered this fact before filing suit. The § 1983 claim and § 1983 conspiracy claim against Defendant Aldridge are frivolous, unreasonable and without legal foundation. The filing of these claims is therefore sanctionable under § 1988. Further, Plaintiffs' counsel's refusal to concede that these claims were without legal foundation and to dismiss them once it became clear that no claim was stated against Defendant Aldridge, needlessly required the court to rule on the frivolous claims, was without any plausible legal basis or justification for such refusal, and reflects at a minimum recklessness and indifference. By not dismissing the claim against Aldridge Plaintiffs' counsel pursued a course ""that a reasonably careful attorney would have known, after appropriate inquiry, to be unsound"". See Walter v. Fiorenzo, 840 F.2d 427, 433-34 (7th Cir. 1988). The refusal to dismiss the § 1983 claims against Defendant Aldridge was unreasonable and vexatious and, therefore, sanctionable under § 1927.   It is claimed by Defendants that Plaintiffs and their counsel alleged Defendants violated well-established constitutional law (Compl. ¶ 24), but Plaintiffs and their counsel failed to research the law before filing their allegations and failed to acknowledge controlling legal precedent when brought to their attention. This claim appears to be sound. For example, Count I of the Complaint alleges that Webb was denied ""substantive and procedural due process under BSU regulations"" by the AFE Committee. (Id. ¶ 31.) Yet, at the time the Complaint was filed it had been well-established that a procedural due process claim premised upon the failure to follow procedures provided under state law or regulations was frivolous as a matter of law. See Swartz v. Scruton, 964 F.2d 607, 610 (7th Cir. 1992) (""Procedural interests under state law are not themselves property rights that will be enforced in the name of the Constitution.""); Greening v. Moran, 953 F.2d 301, 304 (7th Cir. 1992) (stating claim that the state failed to follow its own procedural rules in violation of due process is frivolous) (citing Szabo Food Serv., Inc. v. Canteen Corp., 823 F.2d 1073, 1080 (7th Cir. 1987); cf. Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 541-43 (1981) (holding due process not violated by random, unauthorized act by state employee where state cannot predict or realistically prevent deprivation and state provides a meaningful post-deprivation remedy); Hudson v. Palmer 468 U.S. 517, 532-33 (1984) (extending Parratt to intentional deprivations of property). This frivolous procedural due process claim warrants the imposition of § 1988 sanctions.    This is in addition to those against Defendant Aldridge.   To state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) he or she had a protected life, liberty or property interest; and (2) he or she was deprived of that interest without due process of law. See Parratt, 451 U.S. at 531-35. The Plaintiffs alleged deprivations of both property and liberty interests. They argued that because Webb had a property interest in his continued employment as a tenured professor, if ""the defendants attempt to terminate him without just cause, he would be entitled to raise a claim of deprivation of that property interest without due process under the Fourteenth Amendment."" (Pls.' Suppl. Resp. Defs.' Mots. Dismiss Summ. J. Mem. Supp. at 3.) Plaintiffs, however, neither claimed nor offered evidence that any Defendant attempted to terminate Webb's employment. Thus, Webb's due process claim to the extent it was based on an alleged deprivation of his property right to his continued employment was frivolous and without any plausible factual foundation. The making of such a claim is therefore sanctionable under § 1988.   Plaintiffs also claimed Webb suffered deprivation of property interests involving a pay raise and his removal from the Department's Chair position. They did not allege or offer any evidence that Webb had a legitimate claim of entitlement to a better raise or the Chair position. It was well-established in 1997, though, that ""[t]o have a property interest in a benefit, a person . . . must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it."" Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). Thus, Webb's due process claims based on alleged deprivation of property interests in his pay raise and Chair position were legally and factually groundless and are sanctionable under § 1988.   As for Wisner, Plaintiffs claimed she was denied a property right, but neither alleged nor proved any facts to support that claim. Nor did they argue in response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the due process claims that Wisner was denied any property right. The total failure to support such a claim with any factual allegations or evidence justifies the imposition of sanctions under § 1988 for bringing a frivolous claim without foundation in fact or law.    As for Wisner, the Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum does not even attempt to argue that she was deprived of a liberty interest. More importantly, the Plaintiffs have not come forward with any evidence which would support such a claim by Wisner.   Plaintiffs also alleged violations of their First Amendment rights. The claimed protected speech included Webb's reporting of allegations of sexual harassment of students by two faculty in the Department (Meagher and Cotlar). Though the court ultimately concluded that Plaintiffs' speech was not protected because they were not speaking on matters of public concern, such complaints could have constituted protected speech under different circumstances. Furthermore, though the Complaint alleged other instances of arguably protected speech, for example, the Plaintiffs' filing of an action in state court (Compl. ¶ 35) and their filing of EEOC Charges of Discrimination (id. ¶¶ 36, 46, 49(G), 51), Plaintiffs did not rely on them in opposing Defendants' dispositive motion.   But a plaintiff asserting a First Amendment retaliation claim must demonstrate ""that the protected speech caused, or at least played a substantial part in"" the decision to take an adverse employment action against the employee. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977). Plaintiffs wholly failed to present any evidence that any of Defendants' actions were motivated by the claimed protected speech. This utter failure warrants sanctions under § 1988 for bringing and prosecuting frivolous claims lacking any factual basis.   3. Preliminary Injunction Request  Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs unreasonably multiplied the proceedings by requesting a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction lasted approximately six days during the holiday season. The immediacy of the injunction, Plaintiffs' claimed, was because of the course scheduling assignments and the impending start of the winter semester. It is uncontradicted that Plaintiff Webb, however, had known of the course assignments since at least early September, but waited until mid-December to seek injunctive relief. From the presentation of evidence at the hearing, Plaintiffs had not spent the intervening three months gathering facts and evidence to support their claims and request for injunctive relief. Rather, it became obvious to the court that they used the preliminary injunction hearing in large part as a discovery tool. This demand of valuable court time as well as the time of opposing counsel and Defendants unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings in this case. Plaintiffs were entitled to seek a preliminary injunction in the broad sense, true enough. But Plaintiffs lack of preparedness and use of the hearing as a discovery tool in great part cannot be condoned. Counsel should be sanctioned under § 1927 for abusing the time and resources of the court and defense counsel.    Thus, Plaintiffs' complaint that no discovery was taken in this case falls on deaf ears. It is noted that Plaintiffs moved for additional discovery, but their motion failed to comply with FED. R. CIV. P. 56(f).   The court takes seriously a request for sanctions and is generally hesitant to impose sanctions but finds them warranted here for the various reasons stated supra. The court further finds that a sanctions award is necessary to deter frivolous filings in cases such as this.   D. Calculation of a Reasonable Attorneys' Fee  Having decided that sanctions are appropriate, the court now turns to the issue of the appropriate amount of an award of attorneys' fees. Determination of a reasonable attorney's fee begins with the lodestar amount which is calculated ""by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate."" Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 888 (1984) (citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424[, 433] (1983)); see Uphoff v. Elegant Bath, Ltd., 176 F.3d 399, 407 (7th Cir. 1999); Leffler v. Meer, 936 F.2d 981, 985 (7th Cir. 1991). The court may reduce or augment the lodestar amount by considering twelve factors, Hensley, 461 U.S. at 430 n. 3, commonly referred to as the Hensley factors. ""The party seeking the fee award bears the burden of proving the reasonableness of the hours worked and the hourly rates claimed."" Spegon v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 175 F.3d 544, 550 (7th Cir. 1999); see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433. The district court must exclude from the lodestar amount any hours that were not reasonably expended. Id. In addition, ""[w]here the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly."" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433; Harper v. City of Chicago Heights, 223 F.3d 593, 605 (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied sub nom., City of Chicago Heights Chicago Heights Election Comm'n v. Harper, 121 S.Ct. 883 (U.S. Jan. 22, 2001) (""when a fee petition is vague or inadequately documented, a district court may either strike the problematic entries or (in recognition of the impracticalities of requiring courts to do an item-by-item accounting) reduce the proposed fee by a reasonable percentage.""). To compensate for the delay in payment of attorney's fees, the court may make an adjustment by calculating the fee using the attorney's current rates. See Smith v. Village of Maywood, 17 F.3d 219, 221 (7th Cir. 1994).    The factors are: ""(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ""undesirability"" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases."" Id.   An attorney's ""reasonable hourly rate"" should be based on the ""market rate"" that lawyers of similar ability and experience in the community charge for the types of services rendered. See Spegon, 175 F.3d at 554-55; People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 90 F.3d 1307, 1310 (7th Cir. 1996). An attorney's billing rate is presumptively the prevailing market rate for the attorney's services. See Spegon, 175 F.3d at 555; People Who Care, 90 F.3d at 1310; Gusman v. Unisys Corp., 986 F.2d 1146, 1150 (7th Cir. 1993). The party seeking fees bears the burden of presenting evidence of the market rate. See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n. 11 (1984); Harper, 223 F.3d at 604; Spegon, 175 F.3d at 554. If the party seeking fees offers evidence of the market rate, then the burden is on the opposing party to show why a lower rate is more appropriate. See Spegon, 175 F.3d at 554-55; People Who Care, 90 F.3d at 1313.   Plaintiffs have not challenged the reasonableness of the attorney's fees requested by Defendants, except for a passing incorporation by reference to Attorney Dowling's broad sweeping and conclusory criticism of the fees. Instead, Plaintiffs seek a hearing on Defendants' petition and an opportunity to be heard and question the reasonableness and calculation of the requested fees. In his separate response limited to sanctions sought against him, Mr. Dowling challenges the overall reasonableness of the fee request (calling the request ""bloated""), but does not challenge the hourly rate claimed by defense counsel. Defendants' fee petition was filed on January 31, 2000, and the verified and amended fee petition was filed on June 23, 2000. Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1, a party opposing a motion has fifteen days after service of the motion to respond thereto. S.D. IND. L.R. 7.1(a). The time for being heard on these matters has long passed. Plaintiffs filed a response to the petition for fees but simply chose not to directly address the reasonableness and calculation of the requested fees. They therefore have waived any right to contest the reasonableness or calculation of the requested fees. Plaintiffs' request for a hearing is DENIED.   Mr. Dowling urges that the ""inflated"" amount of fees requested justifies denial of the request for fees, citing Hamilton v. Daley, 777 F.2d 1207, 1215 n. 7 (7th Cir. 1985) (stating that ""the more time and effort a defendant spends in defending a Section 1983 case, the less likely it is that the case was frivolous and that a fee award is appropriate""); Brown v. Stackler, 612 F.2d 1057, 1059 (7th Cir. 1980) (counsel claimed over 800 hours of billable time in a simple case which would be disposed by a decision in a pending case). Neither case holds that a request for a substantial amount of fees alone justifies denial for the fee request. Hamilton expressly held that an award of attorney's fees was appropriate. Hamilton, 777 F.2d at 1215. The court, however, questioned why defendants spent so much time on the case where the case was frivolous from the filing of the complaint-the claim was barred by absolute prosecutorial immunity. Id. at 1214-15. The court therefore remanded the case for a determination of whether the work performed was appropriate under the circumstances. Id. at 1215-16. The Seventh Circuit in Brown affirmed the district court's denial of § 1988 fees where most of counsel's work consisted of motions for extension of time and the plaintiff's action ""raised an issue which everyone knew would be controlled by the results of litigation pending in other courts."" Brown, 612 F.2d at 1058. The court found counsel's claim of over 800 billable hours ""intolerably inflated"" and ""outrageously unreasonable"" such that it warranted a complete denial of the fee request. Id. at 1059.   Brown is factually distinguishable from the instant case. Plaintiffs' action did not raise issues controlled by pending litigation in other courts and defense counsel did much more than merely file requests for extensions of time. Moreover, the Seventh Circuit has concluded in a case subsequent to Brown that a complete denial of a fee request is not warranted simply because a fee request is ""excessive and unreasonable."" Zabkowicz v. West Bend Co., Div. of Dart Indus., Inc., 789 F.2d 540, 549-50 (7th Cir. 1986).   In an effort to avoid the imposition of sanctions under § 1927 against him, Ralph E. Dowling, Plaintiffs' local counsel attempts to minimize his role as counsel in this action. (See Resp. Pls.' Local Counsel Ralph E. Dowling Sanctions Mot. at 8-9 (arguing he was not retained to advise Plaintiffs as to the advisability of any course of action pursued but rather, inter alia, ""to be available for rapid filings,"" ""to file the complaint and summons,"" and ""to proofread documents for style, form and compliance with local rules.""); R. Dowling Aff. ¶¶ 2(a)-(f), 3-4, 10.) Mr. Dowling claims that he ""questioned no witnesses at the injunction hearing."" (Resp. Pls.' Local Counsel at 9.) The official transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing, however, belies this claim. The transcript indicates that Mr. Dowling questioned Paul Errington, albeit briefly. (Tr. Prelim. Inj. Hrg., Vol. II, at 324-29.) Mr. Dowling urges that the duty of local counsel is reduced, citing Long v. Quantex Resources, Inc., 108 F.R.D. 416, 417 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). But § 1927 makes no differentiation between the liability of local counsel and foreign counsel. And, even in Long local counsel was held accountable for filing papers in violation of Rule 11. See Long, 108 F.R.D. at 417.   Mr. Dowling argues that Defendants have not identified any particular conduct of his that is sanctionable under § 1927. He states that the ""the only things he filed with the Court were those papers necessary to initiate the suit-most notably the Complaint. And, local counsel did not write the Complaint."" (Resp. Pls.' Local Counsel at 9) (citations omitted). Mr. Dowling ignores the fact that the very act of signing or filing, that is ""presenting,"" a complaint may be sanctionable. Cf. Fin. Inv. Co. (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Geberit AG, 165 F.3d 526, 533 (7th Cir. 1998) (applying pre-1993 version of Rule 11 and stating that the signing of the complaint violated Rule 11); FED. R. CIV. P. 11(b) (""By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing . . .) a pleading. . . .); FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments) (""The person signing, [or] filing . . . a document has a nondelegable responsibility to the court, and in most situations is the person to be sanctioned for a violation."") Mr. Dowling offers no legal authority to support his implicit assumption of a requirement that the person presenting the complaint have written the complaint and the court is unaware of any.    Like the pre-1993 version of the rule, the 1993 amendments to the rule applicable here require attorneys to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and law before signing pleadings and prescribes sanctions for a violation of this duty. See FED. R. CIV. P. 11(b)(2) and (3); FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments).   Mr. Dowling also argues that § 1927 authorizes sanctions for conduct that occurs only after a case is commenced, citing MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Moore, 952 F.2d 1120, 1121 (9th Cir. 1991), and Yagman v. Baden, 796 F.2d 1165, 1187 (9th Cir. 1986). That may be the law in the Ninth Circuit. The Seventh Circuit, however, has held that the filing of a complaint can constitute an unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of the proceedings and therefore be sanctionable under § 1927. See Fin. Inv. Co., 165 F.3d at 533 (counsel filed suit in federal district court in Indiana after learning that none of plaintiffs had a colorable claim in litigation in federal district court in Florida). Overnite Transp. Co. v. Chicago Indus. Tire Co., 697 F.2d 789, 794 (7th Cir. 1983), quoted by Mr. Dowling is distinguishable because the claim in that case was one of first impression and, further, the prior action in that case had been filed in state rather than federal court.   Mr. Dowling states that he undertook the equivalent of 3-4 days of legal research into the relevant statutes and case law when Plaintiffs approached him about acting as counsel in the case. Given the fast approaching end of the limitations period, counsel is not expected to have undertaken as complete a prefiling inquiry as he could have had Plaintiffs approached him earlier. See Smith v. Our Lady of the Lake Hosp., Inc., 960 F.2d 439, 444, 447 (5th Cir. 1992); FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments) (explaining that the extent to which one has researched the issues and found some support for the theories through consultation with other counsel should be considered in determining whether paragraph (b)(2) has been violated). Further, Mr. Dowling states that the legal theories of the Complaint seemed consistent with his knowledge of the law as well as the explanation of the law of with lead counsel, Jonah Goldschmidt. The advisory committee's note to Rule 11 states that in determining whether legal claims are warranted by existing law or a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law or establishment of new law, a court should consider ""the extent to which a litigant has researched the issues and found some support for its theories . . . or through consultation with other attorneys. . . ."" FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments). Defendants do not seek sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, but the court believes equity favors consideration of like factors in determining the appropriateness of sanctions under § 1927. The court will take these things into consideration when determining whether § 1927 sanctions against Mr. Dowling are warranted and, if so, in what amount. The court defers decision of these matters for another day, however.    Because the court is unable to determine what portion of Defendants' claimed attorneys' fees and expenses are attributable to sanctionable claims, the court finds supplemental documentation necessary. It would be next to impossible to determine what sanction, if any, is appropriate against Mr. Dowling under § 1927 without the benefit of that supplementation since that statute ""provides only for excess costs caused by the plaintiffs' attorneys' vexatious behavior and consequent multiplication of the proceedings, and not for the total costs of the litigation."" Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 756 n. 3 (1980) (quotation omitted); Pac. Dunlop Holdings, Inc. v. Barosh, 22 F.3d 113, 120 (7th Cir. 1994).   Neither Plaintiffs nor Mr. Dowling on his own behalf have offered any evidence to contradict the hourly rates claimed by Defendants' counsel-$150.00 per hour for partners and $130.00 per hour for senior associates. As the evidence offered by Defendants is unrebutted, the court is required to base the attorney's fee award on the rates claimed by defense counsel, see Pressley v. Haeger, 977 F.2d 295, 299 (7th Cir. 1992) (holding court abused its discretion in reducing attorney's hourly rate used to compute attorney's fees where claimed rate was supported by affidavits of attorneys participating in case and by affidavit of another attorney verifying the market rates).   The court, however, is without sufficient information to determine the appropriate attorneys' fee and sanction award. In support of Defendants' fee petition, Defendants submitted the affidavit of Scott E. Schockley, their attorney, with attached billing statements for the months of August 1997 through December 1999. The court cannot discern from the entries in the billing statements which requested fees were incurred in defending against the sanctionable claims. Though some entries are somewhat specific, as a general rule the entries are lacking in sufficient detail. The entries for September 1, 2 and 3, 1997 are illustrative. They provide as follows:    For example, an entry for September 8, 1997, includes ""research re Title VII retaliation.""     9/01/97 JHM 1.00 Research re defenses to claims 9/02/97 SES 0.50 Research 9/02/97 JHM 0.90 Research law 9/03/97 SES 3.00 Research on Motions    From entries such as these the court cannot determine whether the time expended doing research or other activity is attributable to the sanctionable claims and whether the expenditure of time was reasonable. Therefore, the court directs Defendants to submit revised documentation in support of their fee petition, providing a sufficient explanation of the expenditure of attorney time and expenses to allow the court to ascertain the reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses and to determine the amount of fees and expenses attributable to the sanctionable claims. The supplemental submission should be limited to time expended on matters for which sanctions are being allowed in this entry. The court will assume that the Defendants seek reimbursement for two-thirds of the amount of time expended on those, as reflected above in footnote number two.    A reasonable attorneys' fee includes ""expenses of litigation that are distinct from either statutory costs or the costs of the lawyer's time reflected in his hourly billing rates — expenses for such things as postage, long-distance calls, xeroxing, travel. . . ."" Heiar v. Crawford County, Wis., 746 F.2d 1190, 1203 (7th Cir. 1984).   As for Defendant Wynola Richards, she seeks total attorney fees in the amount of $3,037.50 as stated in the affidavit of her attorney, Roger P. Ralph. Plaintiffs do not challenge Attorney Ralph's request hourly rate of $125, and this rate is identical to the rate awarded earlier in this case for the fees related to the quashing of the subpoena served on Richards. The affidavit, however, fails to provide any information upon which the court could find that all of the 25.7 hours expended (in addition to the 3.6 hours expended in quashing a subpoena served on Richards) in the defense of this action were reasonable and expended in defense of the sanctionable claims. Therefore, the court directs Defendant Richards to submit revised documentation in support of her fee petition, providing a sufficient explanation of the expenditure of attorney time and expenses on the matters with respect to which sanctions are being awarded, only, to allow the court to ascertain the reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses and to determine the amount of fees and expenses attributable to the sanctionable claims.   III. Conclusion  Plaintiffs' request for a hearing on Defendants' petition for fees is DENIED. Defendants' petition for attorneys' fees and motion for sanctions as well as their verified and amended petition for attorneys' fees and motion for sanctions are GRANTED.   Defendants are ORDERED to submit revised documentation supporting their request for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses within fifteen days of the date of this entry to assist the court in determining the appropriate amount of the fee and sanction award.

I was too drunk. It doesn’t excuse anything, but I thought I’d let you know what a loser I am.”Get Breaking News AlertsStay up-to-date with important news developments, delivered right to your inbox.A Globe investigation has uncovered a culture of blatant sexual harassment at Berklee with at least three male professors, including Galindo, allowed to quietly leave since 2008, after students reported being assaulted, groped, or pressured into sex with their teachers, according to court documents and interviews with more than a dozen people. Administrators at the renowned music school tolerated lecherous behavior, former Berklee students and employees said, and often silenced the accusers through financial settlements with gag orders attached.Berklee administrators defended the school’s track record, saying in a statement that Berklee has rigorous policies and procedures to deal with claims of sexual harassment.“Although we do not discuss specific matters publicly out of respect for all involved and limitations on what we are legally permitted to share, we take matters that impede the learning or working environment of our students, faculty, and staff seriously and act promptly to address them,” the school said.The allegations against the Berklee professors come at a time of heightened attention to sexual harassment following revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of groping, raping, and harassing women for decades. Since the scandal became public last month, women have felt empowered to speak up about alleged abuse, especially when they believe their abusers remain free to victimize others.The woman who reported being assaulted by Galindo said that when she initially spoke with Berklee administrators in 2012, they discouraged her from pressing forward with a court case because, she said, they assured her Galindo would never work at another school.Yet Galindo went on to teach at the New England Conservatory in Boston. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears professional reprisals, was horrified to discover in 2016 that Galindo was teaching again and notified the conservatory. His contract there was not renewed, according to the school. But he continued working at the Longy School of Music of Bard College in Cambridge until last week, when the woman found out he was employed there, contacted administrators, and the school severed ties with him. Galindo had worked there since 2009.<div id="""" class=""image | relative margin_bottom_16

He is listed as a part-time faculty member at the Rivers School, a college prep school in Weston. Christine Martin, a Rivers spokeswoman, said Tuesday that Galindo has been affiliated with the school since 2015, and that he arrived with positive references. She was unable to say who had provided those references. On Wednesday, another spokeswoman called the Globe after this story was published online to say that Galindo had been terminated, effective immediately.Berklee, in a statement, said one institution requested a reference regarding Galindo and “we provided the termination letter which included an explicit statement that explained the reasons for his departure from the college.” A Berklee spokesman declined to say when that correspondence happened or which institution requested the information.On Wednesday, within hours of this story going online, a student-led change.org petition had already gathered more than 290 signatures demanding Berklee “properly address” these types of allegations.Galindo did not return calls and text messages from the Globe seeking comment.‘I am not an idiot’But another former Berklee professor accused of sexual misconduct, prominent jazz saxophonist Greg Osby, did speak with the Globe. A woman accused Osby in 2012 of pressuring her to have sex while she was a student at Berklee. The woman, who also asked to remain anonymous, had graduated several years earlier and established a successful music career, but later reported him to Berklee administrators after growing concerned he might still be preying on students.“I could not bear the feeling that I had a responsibility to do something about this,” said the woman about her decision to finally contact Berklee.Osby, in an hourlong interview with the Globe, disputed the woman’s claims. He also said that he received a severance package from Berklee that included a gag order.“Only an idiot would sleep with students, and I am not an idiot,” Osby said. “I would not do that. But after they graduate, it’s open season.”Osby said Berklee did not give him a chance to defend himself against the claims, but he decided not to contest the charges because he was burned out teaching there.“Bottom line is, and this is a bit harsh, if anyone saw my girlfriend at that time and saw [his Berklee accuser] that would probably end the argument,” Osby said. “Why would I jeopardize my career for somebody like that?”The statement issued by Berklee said the school is committed to a “fair and thorough process for both complainant and respondent,” and that not every case leads to a finding.“As evidenced by our past practices, where an investigation reveals a serious violation of our sexual misconduct policy, we act swiftly and decisively to remove the individuals from our community,” Berklee said.Complaint filed with MCADYet a case filed earlier this year with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, or MCAD, raises questions about Berklee’s commitment to address the issue.<div id="""" class=""image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "">Greg Osby at Berklee College of Music in 2010. Chitose Suzuki for The Boston Globe/FileA 2012 Berklee grad who was hired to run the school’s audio production lab accused a male co-worker of predatory behavior, according to a complaint she filed with MCAD in January. She described unwanted sexual advances by her co-worker toward female students in the lab in mid-2015 and then retaliation against her — leaving condoms in the lab and suggesting sexual liaisons — when she reported his behavior to their boss. But Berklee administrators waited weeks to act, and then failed to monitor the co-worker, who repeatedly violated an order they issued for him to stay away from her, the complaint states.The woman also accused Berklee of brushing off her concerns about inappropriate sexual behavior by a professor in the school’s music production department last year.She “continued to observe and experience a pattern, practice, and pervasive culture of tolerance of sexual harassment at Berklee,” according to the MCAD complaint.Berklee settled the case in April, and that settlement is sealed, too. The woman and her attorney, North Reading lawyer John W. Davis, declined to comment.The former student who accused Galindo of assaulting her when she was too drunk to fend him off said she worked up the nerve to report him to Berklee administrators about six months later. He was let go shortly after. There was no notice to students, no apology to the woman, and no financial settlement.The woman, who was receiving a partial scholarship, said she was afraid even to apply for additional financial aid from Berklee after she reported the assault because Galindo accused her of concocting the story to gain more scholarship money.“I wanted to be believed so bad,” the woman said. “I thought if I ever said anything about money, no one would ever believe me.”Instead, she sought and received private therapy, paid for by Berklee, to help her deal with the trauma. She showed the Globe e-mails from Angela F. F. Davis, then Berklee’s associate dean of students, authorizing these payments. Davis, now an executive director in the state’s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, recently led the agency’s initiative to secure funding for preventing violence against women. She declined to comment.One of the student’s former professors, Tom Plsek, now chair emeritus of the brass department at Berklee, also confirms the woman’s story.“She confided first in a female faculty member . . . and then I found out about it from that female faculty member,” Plsek said. Galindo “was made to take his things and go. I don’t know the exact process, but he was gone [from Berklee] in a few days.”Plsek retired as department chair in 2013 but still teaches a few courses.Another accountHis wife, Stephany Tiernan, a professor and chair emerita of the school’s piano department, has also borne witness to sexual harassment allegations. In one case, a freshman alleged her keyboarding professor, Aruan Ortiz, decided she needed more help with her technique and phoned her late one evening in February 2008, asking to come over to her apartment and offer instructions.The woman had a friend staying with her and “therefore felt safe, and otherwise did not wish to refuse assistance from an instructor,” so she agreed, according to a 2009 lawsuit filed in US District Court in Boston.<div id="""" class=""image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "">Aruan Ortiz.Jimmy KatzBut that instruction quickly turned sour, as soon as the woman’s friend left the room, the suit states, with Ortiz licking the woman, grabbing her, and repeatedly attempting to kiss her. The woman freed herself and ran to her friend in the bathroom.Ortiz then acted as if nothing happened but repeated the behavior as the woman walked him to the door and asked him to leave, according to the lawsuit.She went home to Ohio to tell her parents, but came back a week later only to find a voice message from Ortiz asking her if she was free that evening. That’s when the woman reported his behavior to Berklee administrators. They waited two weeks to start investigating — and only after two of the woman’s instructors urged them to act, according to the lawsuit. It took another two months for Berklee to hold a meeting with Ortiz and the student to review the allegations. Tiernan, who attended that meeting, according to the lawsuit, declined to comment for this story.In that meeting, Ortiz admitted to grabbing the woman’s face, attempting to kiss her, and blowing in her ear. He claimed “it was simply part of his [Cuban] culture,” according to the lawsuit.It would take Berklee another two weeks — after classes had ended for the semester — to inform the woman Ortiz would no longer be teaching at Berklee. The lawsuit, which alleged civil rights violations, and assault and battery, was settled in 2010. The woman, citing a gag order on the settlement, declined to comment. So did her Boston attorney, Paul F. Wood.But Woburn attorney David Fried, who initially represented Ortiz in the case, said in a statement to the Globe that a “single clumsy attempt at a kiss, although certainly improper from a teacher to student, was not ‘sexual harassment’ within the meaning of any relevant statute.”Fried said that Ortiz hired him because Berklee’s insurance company initially declined to represent him.“Eventually they stepped up to the plate, probably because they wanted to settle the whole thing, and I withdrew in their favor,” Fried said. The case was then settled, with terms confidential.The woman who reported Galindo’s alleged assault to Berklee said it took her several years to come to terms with what happened. She is now in her late 20s and a full-time musician.“I came to a point where I could let this ruin my career or just move on,” she said.But there is one constant reminder of that dark experience — her school loans for tuition at Berklee.“I got [screwed] in every way and will be paying Berklee for the next seven years,” she said, but Galindo was allowed to walk away.Kay Lazar can be reached at kay.lazar@globe.com Follow her on Twitter @GlobeKayLazar."

Chitose Suzuki for The Boston Globe/FileA 2012 Berklee grad who was hired to run the school’s audio production lab accused a male co-worker of predatory behavior, according to a complaint she filed with MCAD in January. She described unwanted sexual advances by her co-worker toward female students in the lab in mid-2015 and then retaliation against her — leaving condoms in the lab and suggesting sexual liaisons — when she reported his behavior to their boss. But Berklee administrators waited weeks to act, and then failed to monitor the co-worker, who repeatedly violated an order they issued for him to stay away from her, the complaint states.The woman also accused Berklee of brushing off her concerns about inappropriate sexual behavior by a professor in the school’s music production department last year.She “continued to observe and experience a pattern, practice, and pervasive culture of tolerance of sexual harassment at Berklee,” according to the MCAD complaint.Berklee settled the case in April, and that settlement is sealed, too. The woman and her attorney, North Reading lawyer John W. Davis, declined to comment.The former student who accused Galindo of assaulting her when she was too drunk to fend him off said she worked up the nerve to report him to Berklee administrators about six months later. He was let go shortly after. There was no notice to students, no apology to the woman, and no financial settlement.The woman, who was receiving a partial scholarship, said she was afraid even to apply for additional financial aid from Berklee after she reported the assault because Galindo accused her of concocting the story to gain more scholarship money.“I wanted to be believed so bad,” the woman said. “I thought if I ever said anything about money, no one would ever believe me.”Instead, she sought and received private therapy, paid for by Berklee, to help her deal with the trauma. She showed the Globe e-mails from Angela F. F. Davis, then Berklee’s associate dean of students, authorizing these payments. Davis, now an executive director in the state’s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, recently led the agency’s initiative to secure funding for preventing violence against women. She declined to comment.One of the student’s former professors, Tom Plsek, now chair emeritus of the brass department at Berklee, also confirms the woman’s story.“She confided first in a female faculty member . . . and then I found out about it from that female faculty member,” Plsek said. Galindo “was made to take his things and go. I don’t know the exact process, but he was gone [from Berklee] in a few days.”Plsek retired as department chair in 2013 but still teaches a few courses.Another accountHis wife, Stephany Tiernan, a professor and chair emerita of the school’s piano department, has also borne witness to sexual harassment allegations. In one case, a freshman alleged her keyboarding professor, Aruan Ortiz, decided she needed more help with her technique and phoned her late one evening in February 2008, asking to come over to her apartment and offer instructions.The woman had a friend staying with her and “therefore felt safe, and otherwise did not wish to refuse assistance from an instructor,” so she agreed, according to a 2009 lawsuit filed in US District Court in Boston.<div id="""" class=""image | relative margin_bottom_16

The woman freed herself and ran to her friend in the bathroom.Ortiz then acted as if nothing happened but repeated the behavior as the woman walked him to the door and asked him to leave, according to the lawsuit.She went home to Ohio to tell her parents, but came back a week later only to find a voice message from Ortiz asking her if she was free that evening. That’s when the woman reported his behavior to Berklee administrators. They waited two weeks to start investigating — and only after two of the woman’s instructors urged them to act, according to the lawsuit. It took another two months for Berklee to hold a meeting with Ortiz and the student to review the allegations. Tiernan, who attended that meeting, according to the lawsuit, declined to comment for this story.In that meeting, Ortiz admitted to grabbing the woman’s face, attempting to kiss her, and blowing in her ear. He claimed “it was simply part of his [Cuban] culture,” according to the lawsuit.It would take Berklee another two weeks — after classes had ended for the semester — to inform the woman Ortiz would no longer be teaching at Berklee. The lawsuit, which alleged civil rights violations, and assault and battery, was settled in 2010. The woman, citing a gag order on the settlement, declined to comment. So did her Boston attorney, Paul F. Wood.But Woburn attorney David Fried, who initially represented Ortiz in the case, said in a statement to the Globe that a “single clumsy attempt at a kiss, although certainly improper from a teacher to student, was not ‘sexual harassment’ within the meaning of any relevant statute.”Fried said that Ortiz hired him because Berklee’s insurance company initially declined to represent him.“Eventually they stepped up to the plate, probably because they wanted to settle the whole thing, and I withdrew in their favor,” Fried said. The case was then settled, with terms confidential.The woman who reported Galindo’s alleged assault to Berklee said it took her several years to come to terms with what happened. She is now in her late 20s and a full-time musician.“I came to a point where I could let this ruin my career or just move on,” she said.But there is one constant reminder of that dark experience — her school loans for tuition at Berklee.“I got [screwed] in every way and will be paying Berklee for the next seven years,” she said, but Galindo was allowed to walk away.Kay Lazar can be reached at kay.lazar@globe.com Follow her on Twitter @GlobeKayLazar."

              "">“I’m truly sorry for hurting you. I promise I will never again,” Galindo said in texts shared with the Globe by the woman, then a junior and one of the few female students in her department. “By the way, just to let you know, we never [had intercourse],” said another text in the mea culpa. “I never got it up. I was too drunk. It doesn’t excuse anything, but I thought I’d let you know what a loser I am.”Get Breaking News AlertsStay up-to-date with important news developments, delivered right to your inbox.A Globe investigation has uncovered a culture of blatant sexual harassment at Berklee with at least three male professors, including Galindo, allowed to quietly leave since 2008, after students reported being assaulted, groped, or pressured into sex with their teachers, according to court documents and interviews with more than a dozen people. Administrators at the renowned music school tolerated lecherous behavior, former Berklee students and employees said, and often silenced the accusers through financial settlements with gag orders attached.Berklee administrators defended the school’s track record, saying in a statement that Berklee has rigorous policies and procedures to deal with claims of sexual harassment.“Although we do not discuss specific matters publicly out of respect for all involved and limitations on what we are legally permitted to share, we take matters that impede the learning or working environment of our students, faculty, and staff seriously and act promptly to address them,” the school said.The allegations against the Berklee professors come at a time of heightened attention to sexual harassment following revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of groping, raping, and harassing women for decades. Since the scandal became public last month, women have felt empowered to speak up about alleged abuse, especially when they believe their abusers remain free to victimize others.The woman who reported being assaulted by Galindo said that when she initially spoke with Berklee administrators in 2012, they discouraged her from pressing forward with a court case because, she said, they assured her Galindo would never work at another school.Yet Galindo went on to teach at the New England Conservatory in Boston. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears professional reprisals, was horrified to discover in 2016 that Galindo was teaching again and notified the conservatory. His contract there was not renewed, according to the school. But he continued working at the Longy School of Music of Bard College in Cambridge until last week, when the woman found out he was employed there, contacted administrators, and the school severed ties with him. Galindo had worked there since 2009.<div id="""" class=""image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "">Jeff Galindo in 2010.“If I didn’t report him [to other schools], it would be on me if he did this again,” the woman said.Still, Galindo has continued teaching. He is listed as a part-time faculty member at the Rivers School, a college prep school in Weston. Christine Martin, a Rivers spokeswoman, said Tuesday that Galindo has been affiliated with the school since 2015, and that he arrived with positive references. She was unable to say who had provided those references. On Wednesday, another spokeswoman called the Globe after this story was published online to say that Galindo had been terminated, effective immediately.Berklee, in a statement, said one institution requested a reference regarding Galindo and “we provided the termination letter which included an explicit statement that explained the reasons for his departure from the college.” A Berklee spokesman declined to say when that correspondence happened or which institution requested the information.On Wednesday, within hours of this story going online, a student-led change.org petition had already gathered more than 290 signatures demanding Berklee “properly address” these types of allegations.Galindo did not return calls and text messages from the Globe seeking comment.‘I am not an idiot’But another former Berklee professor accused of sexual misconduct, prominent jazz saxophonist Greg Osby, did speak with the Globe. A woman accused Osby in 2012 of pressuring her to have sex while she was a student at Berklee. The woman, who also asked to remain anonymous, had graduated several years earlier and established a successful music career, but later reported him to Berklee administrators after growing concerned he might still be preying on students.“I could not bear the feeling that I had a responsibility to do something about this,” said the woman about her decision to finally contact Berklee.Osby, in an hourlong interview with the Globe, disputed the woman’s claims.

					Berklee president confirms another misconduct case
					

					
	
	Roger Brown, president of the Berklee College of Music.

Roger Brown, president of the Berklee College of Music.
She grew up in Taiwan, where stepping forward to accuse a professor of sexually inappropriate behavior — of forcing her to hug him before each piano lesson, and demanding she remove her jacket so he could scrutinize her dress — was not something young women do.
But after escalating e-mails from her piano teacher, Bruce Thomas, seeking a closer relationship, the Berklee College of Music junior reported him to school officials in the fall of 2015. She brought all of Thomas’s often bizarre late-night messages as evidence.



Still, it would take Berklee officials another year — despite mounting evidence brought to administrators of similar behavior by Thomas toward at least four other Asian students — to fire the 35-year veteran of the school.
Berklee president Roger Brown, in an interview Wednesday, acknowledged that Thomas was one of 11 faculty members terminated since 2004 for sexual misconduct. Brown defended how administrators at the famed music school have handled allegations of sexual impropriety.
Wednesday night, Brown sent a message to thousands of Berklee alumni noting the “impassioned and vigorous dialogue on campus’’ regarding sexual misconduct and predicted “it is likely that more details of abuse will emerge in the media.’’ He encouraged alumni who experienced sexual misconduct while at Berklee, or knew of someone who had, to report it to the college.
Brown and his administration have been under fire since the Globe reported last week that at least three faculty members had been quietly let go after students accused them of assault or harassment.
Hundreds of students walked out of class on Monday and attended a forum, led by Brown, at which he acknowledged that the problem was greater still, involving at least 11 faculty members over the past 13 years.
As the scandal continues to unfold, Brown said Wednesday that the school will seek guidance from a nationally renowned consultant on federal sexual abuse and harassment laws to help Berklee figure out its next steps.



In the interview, Brown declined to disclose the names of the 11 terminated faculty members — one of several demands made by students during Monday’s emotional forum — but acknowledged the three already identified by the Globe in last week’s article. He confirmed that Thomas was also among the 11.
“If we terminate someone and release their name, their impulse is to blame the person’’ who reported them, increasing the chances the student’s name would be revealed, Brown said.
“I don’t defend [Thomas’s] behavior, and I am not trying to say it was appropriate,’’ Brown said. “But the sanctions, as we went through this, seemed right at the time, and when we got enough evidence, we terminated.’’
Thomas did not return phone calls seeking his comment.
“Do we publicly disclose, or do some release saying professor X was terminated on date Y for sexual misconduct?’’ Brown said.
The Globe’s story last week noted that some cases of alleged sexual abuse at Berklee were quietly resolved with financial settlements that included confidentiality agreements, barring all sides from discussing the cases.
Brown said that in the cases of the 11 faculty members fired for sexual misconduct, none received more than the amount promised in their employment contracts, which often ran three or more years.



“In most cases they were paid less, or sometimes a lot less,’’ he said.
Brown declined to elaborate further on the financial settlements offered to the faculty’s victims.
At Berklee, men predominate in sheer numbers, accounting for 68 percent of students and faculty, according to the school. That imbalance was cited during the Monday forum by faculty and students as contributing to a culture that, they said, has long tolerated sexual misconduct.
For the Asian woman who stepped forward to report Thomas’s behavior, the anxiety was as much about her family as it was the overwhelming male presence on campus.
“My family was against me reporting him, because it’s really a cultural thing,’’ said the woman, who graduated in May and asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional repercussions. “They think I have no chance to win this because he is an old American teacher and I am no one, so he can take revenge.’’
In a series of e-mails and Facebook postings to the woman, Thomas wrote of his longing to see her after she stopped taking his classes, and noted that he was searching for her at various local concerts. The woman shared those e-mails and Facebook postings with the Globe.
After the woman reported Thomas in the fall of 2015, the college issued a written warning to him, according to Berklee. He had already received a verbal warning about his behavior toward another women, the college says.
She said she became aware of at least two other Asian women who had fended off similar behavior from the piano teacher. She said that in the spring of 2016, she brought copies to Berklee officials of e-mails he sent to those women. But she said Berklee officials told her they could not take action unless those two other women, who were too fearful to speak out, agreed to step forward.



Then in July 2016, another Asian woman complained to Berklee about Thomas’s aggressive and increasingly strange behavior.
Finally, in November, he was fired, according to the termination letter. In all, Thomas was accused of inappropriate behavior toward six students over nearly 18 months, according to Brown. The president said the six included a woman who had reported Thomas to the school in early 2015.
That was six months before the Taiwanese woman defied her family’s wishes and spoke out.
Brown defended his administrators’ actions, saying the woman must have misunderstood what Berklee officials told her when she brought evidence of Thomas’s misconduct toward two more students in 2016.
“If the message was interpreted that we can’t do anything if they do not come forward, that’s not true,’’ Brown said.
“We said, can you encourage someone to come forward, but we can do investigations whether someone comes forward or not.’’
Berklee enrolls students from 151 countries, according to Brown. After the Globe’s story last week, one faculty member said she had heard from nearly four dozen students about concerns for foreign students.
“My students are telling me the vast majority of students who are preyed upon [by faculty] are international students who are afraid of losing their scholarship and student visas’’ if they speak out, said the faculty member who asked that she not be identified for fear of professional reprisals. “I didn’t hear this from one student, I heard this over, and over, and over, again.’’

Neither Berklee College nor Steve Kirby have responded to requests from CBC News for further information.The University of Manitoba has previously said Kirby, who taught jazz with the university's school of music, retired in late June after being on leave for six months.​'Burden of work' left to complainantsCiting provincial privacy legislation, the University of Manitoba would not tell Berklee College about its sexual harassment investigation involving Kirby, prompting many of his alleged victims to contact Berklee themselves.""Putting the burden of work on victims' shoulders, victims who are sorting through their own trauma, who are dealing with their own situation, their own lives that have been affected by this — putting that burden of work on those students is abominable to me,"" said Nancy.CBC has confirmed at least six of the women involved in a February 2017 complaint against Kirby independently contacted Berklee College, and communicated their concerns and the university investigator's conclusions.Jazz prof Steve Kirby fired from Berklee CollegeFeatured VideoSteve Kirby has been terminated from his job at Berklee College of Music after a number of University of Manitoba students and former students told the Boston-based college they had been harassed by the jazz professor during his time at the U of M.The University of Manitoba's internal reports from last June detailed allegations of inappropriate comments, sexually explicit analogies, unwanted and lingering touching, long unwanted hugs and intimate ear-whispering.  In reports reviewed by CBC, the investigator concluded all of the allegations had merit and that Kirby's alleged behaviour constituted ""sexual harassment"" and would have created an ""intimidating, humiliating or offensive work or learning environment"" for female students.Although repeated attempts by CBC News to reach Kirby have been unsuccessful, in the university's internal investigation report, he ""denies all claims made of any sexual innuendo or outright sexual approaches.""The women at the heart of the internal sexual harassment investigation into Kirby's conduct say the province's flawed privacy laws forced them to contact, and warn, his new employer.The University of Manitoba told CBC it cannot share the details of internal investigations about staff because of provincial legislation. Both the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) and Workplace Health and Safety rules prohibit the university from sharing the information, the university said.""The university is not able to proactively disclose information about investigations to external third parties. This would be a breach of legislation, including privacy and workplace, safety and health,"" the university's executive director of public affairs, John Danakas, said in a statement to CBC in September.FIPPA 'safety clause' allows wiggle roomBut there is some wiggle room within the existing legislation.""Disclosures are permitted under specific circumstances, where disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of any individual or group of individuals,"" said Cathy Cox, the provincial minister responsible for FIPPA, in a statement to CBC.So when Berklee started looking into the matter, why didn't the University of Manitoba enact the ""safety"" clause and share its internal investigation findings with Berklee College?""Most experts will explain that the safety clause requires a high onus to demonstrate 'imminent danger,' as it involves taking away an individual's inherent right to privacy,"" Danakas explained in an email.""Even the police only use those sections on occasion when a person, for example, is released from prison and deemed likely to reoffend.""'They didn't believe that we were in danger'""It shows that they didn't quite take it seriously enough. They didn't believe that we were in danger,"" said a woman CBC is calling Krista, another student who took her concerns both to the university and to Winnipeg police.""Physically, the women were in danger.

That is speaking to the government about provincial laws, writing letters, writing petitions,"" she said.""Put your opinions forward to the university, to the government about the privacy laws.

""And it's a problem when the staff at the university is not trained to know when someone is coming forward speaking to you about abuse that they are experiencing, it is likely the tip of the iceberg.""Nancy believes the university needs to develop better supports for students to guide them through the complaint process and keep them in the loop about the progress being made.""Sharing this kind of information is very distressing for a victim [who] often is in the middle of processing it themselves. So staff at the university needs to be more educated about trauma and this type of abuse.

It described those steps as:   Meetings between senior U of M leadership and the Faculty of Music Students' Association. Constructive, primarily listening opportunities.   Meetings between U of M leadership and the University of Manitoba Student's Union and the Graduate Students' Association. Beginning process of policy review.

Aryeh MOTZKIN, Plaintiff,
v.
TRUSTEES OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY, Defendant.
C.A. No. 95-10450-RCL.
United States District Court, D. Massachusetts.
August 5, 1996.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION REGARDING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (FILED ORIGINALLY AS A MOTION TO DISMISS) 
(DOCKET NO. 6) 
June 4, 1996
KAROL, United States Magistrate Judge.
In 1992, defendants, the Trustees of Boston University (""Trustees"" or ""BU""), entered into a contract with plaintiff, Aryeh Motzkin (""Motzkin""), under which Motzkin would teach three courses per semester in BU's College of Liberal Arts (""CLA"") during the academic years 1993-94, 1994-95, and 1995-96. By letter dated March 31, 1995, effective immediately, Motzkin was notified that the Trustees had voted to accept the recommendation of a specially appointed faculty committee that Motzkin's contract be terminated for cause. The committee's recommendation was based on its finding, following a several-day adjudicatory hearing, that Motzkin had sexually harassed students, sexually assaulted and harassed a faculty colleague, violated BU's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Policy by serving alcohol to underage students, and made false reports to the hearing committee regarding the charges against him. Motzkin denies some of those charges, but he does not dispute that he is unfit to teach. To the contrary, he insists that, because of a psychological disorder from which he suffers that causes ""disinhibition,"" (Am.Compl., docket no. 16, ¶¶ 7-9), he lacks sufficient control, even with counseling and medication, to refrain from engaging in intolerable conduct of the very type in which the faculty hearing committee found he had engaged. Nonetheless, he commenced this lawsuit challenging his termination on grounds ranging from breach of contract to discrimination on the basis of disability. (Compl., docket no. 1) Then, after BU had filed its present motion, Motzkin amended his complaint to include, among other things, a claim that BU defamed him and invaded his right to privacy by filing certain confidential documents and leaking information to the press. (Am. Compl.) For reasons stated below, I recommend that all eight counts of Motzkin's amended complaint be dismissed.[1] 
I. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS
Unless otherwise noted, the facts stated in this section are either undisputed or stated in the light most favorable to Motzkin. See, *986 e.g., Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990). 
A. Motzkin's Special Appointment
Motzkin was initially hired by BU in 1987 or 1988 to teach courses within the CLA's Core Curriculum and Department of Philosophy. (Am.Compl. ¶ 5; Salary History and 1989 Faculty Salary Recommendation Form, attached to Aff. Counsel Regarding Contract Records, docket no. 13, of 5/8/95.) He was given the untenured rank of Associate Professor. (1989 Faculty Salary Form.) The record is unclear whether he was on a tenure track for a period of time prior to 1992, but, in any event, he had not obtained tenure by the end of 1992. Moreover, he had made it clear by his words and conduct that his overriding interest was teaching  not research, writing, or publishing. Accordingly, by letter dated December 4, 1992 (but dated November 7, 1992 on its second page), CLA Dean Dennis D. Berkey (""Berkey"") offered Motzkin a special, three-year teaching appointment as a nontenured Associate Professor of the Humanities and Adjunct Associate Professor of Philosophy. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem.Supp.Mot. Dismiss (""Def.'s Supplem.Mem.""), docket no. 21, Ex. 1.) For each semester through academic year 1995-96, Motzkin was to teach the equivalent of two courses within the Core Curriculum and one philosophy course within the Department of Philosophy. (Id.) As Berkey emphasized in his letter: This appointment is extended in recognition of your strong contributions in teaching to the Core Curriculum. It is a special appointment, with primary emphasis on the teaching role. Therefore, in accepting this appointment you must agree to relinquish any claim for tenure status on the basis of the longevity of your service on the faculty of Boston University.
(See id. ¶ 6 (emphasis added).) Motzkin accepted this ""special appointment"" on December 9, 1992. (Id. at 2.)
Although Berkey did not, in his December 4 letter, specifically alert Motzkin to the fact that his appointment could be terminated early for cause, he referred to the Faculty Handbook (the ""Handbook"") as governing the issue of reappointment and the question whether Motzkin would be eligible for future tenure consideration. (See id. ¶¶ 5, 7.) Both parties attached excerpts of the Handbook to their pleadings in this lawsuit and often referred to it as authoritative with respect to the issues in this case. This is not surprising, since the Handbook, by its terms, provides that the policies set forth in it ""are applicable University-wide to all faculty employed by Boston University"" and that ""[a]n individual's acceptance of employment at Boston University is sufficient to make the terms of the University's policies applicable without further notice or agreement."" (Mem.Supp.Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Compl. (""Def.'s Mem.""), docket no. 8, Ex. C at 44.) On the basis of these statements, BU asserts, and Motzkin agrees, (Tr. of 7/13/95 Hr'g, docket no. 33, at 9, 64), that the policies and procedures set forth in the Handbook, including the ones discussed below dealing with early termination, are incorporated into Motzkin's contract.
The Handbook devotes an entire section to policies and procedures by which faculty members may be suspended or terminated on the basis of ""gross neglect of duty or other applicable cause ... during the term of an appointment."" (Handbook at 67-69.) Those particular policies and procedures were adopted December 4, 1990, which was approximately two years after Motzkin's initial appointment and two years before he accepted the appointment that is the subject of this lawsuit. (Id. at 67 n. *.) The Handbook sets forth an elaborate process that must be followed before a faculty member may be terminated for cause ""during the term of an appointment."" (Id. at 67-69.) The final step in that multi-stage process is described in the Faculty Handbook as follows: 8. Consideration by the Board of Trustees. The Board's review of the case shall be based on the record of the hearing [conducted by special committee of five faculty members appointed for that purpose] and any further briefs presented in *987 writing by the principals and/or their representatives. The decision of the Board of Trustees shall be final.
It was pursuant to this process that the Trustees purported to terminate Motzkin's special appointment effective March 31, 1995. (Def.'s Mem.Ex.H.) 
B. Allegations Against Motzkin
Complaints against Motzkin first surfaced during the 1991-92 academic year, when several female students reported that he was pressuring them to attend a party at his house. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. D: Statement of the Grounds for the Suspension or Termination of the Appointment of Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin (""Statement of Grounds""), dated 1/95, ¶ 4(a).) Because the students were unwilling to file formal charges, the Chairman of the Department of Philosophy, Professor Charles Griswold, raised the subject with Motzkin informally and advised him to be careful regarding his conduct toward students. (Id.)
The following fall, a student in one of Motzkin's classes registered concern to Assistant Dean Brian Jorgensen about an incident in which Motzkin had approached her where she worked and invited her to lunch. (Id. ¶ 4(b).) He addressed the matter with Motzkin, who gave assurances that he would avoid such conduct in the future. (Id.)
Concerns about Motzkin escalated shortly after September 11, 1993. On that date, Motzkin took an underage female student to dinner off campus, ostensibly to discuss the possibility of her doing some translation work for him. (Id. ¶¶ 3(b), 7; Motzkin Aff., docket no. 27, Ex. A: letter from Motzkin to Berkey of 9/28/93, at 2-3.) It is undisputed that, during dinner, in violation of BU's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Policy, Motzkin purchased the student some wine to accompany her meal. (Id. at 2.) According to the student (but denied by Motzkin), he also made suggestive remarks. (Id. at 2-3; Statement of Grounds ¶ 3(b).) This incident prompted Berkey to issue a formal reprimand to Motzkin and a warning that ""a future reoccurrence of this type of situation could result in more severe sanctions."" (Am.Compl. ¶ 11; Statement of Grounds ¶ 4(c) (quoting letter from Berkey to Motzkin of 10/18/93.))
In May 1994, Berkey received a memorandum from a female faculty member in which the faculty member alleged that, beginning in 1991, Motzkin had made repeated, unwanted advances toward her; had sexually assaulted her; and had frequently intimated that, in exchange for her favors, he would be willing to use his purported influence with senior administration officials to help her get tenure. (Def.'s Mem.Ex.D: Statement of Additional Grounds for the Suspension or Termination of the Appointment of Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin (""Statement of Additional Grounds"") ¶¶ 8-15.) The faculty member declined to file a formal complaint at that time, however. (Id. ¶ 16.)
In the summer of 1994, Berkey met with Motzkin and admonished him not to dine alone with female students away from campus. (Statement of Grounds ¶ 4(d).) He also told him that he was in a ""strike-two situation,"" that his current contract would not be renewed, that he should start looking for another position, and that any additional misconduct would result in his termination. (Id.) Despite this explicit warning, Motzkin promptly took another underage student to dinner off campus on September 27, 1994; purchased alcohol for her in violation of BU's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Policy; drove her to a suburban hotel (the circumstances are disputed but the fact that he did so is not); and allegedly engaged in offensive and inappropriate conduct. (Id. ¶¶ 3(c), 7; Motzkin Aff.Ex.A: letter to the Sexual Harassment Committee from Motzkin of 10/27/94 at 1-5.) Around the same time, one of Motzkin's former students came forward with allegations that, in October 1990, Motzkin had invited her to his house under false pretenses and made inappropriate remarks and suggestions of a sexual nature to her while they were there. (Id. at 5-6; Statement of Grounds ¶ 3(a).) 
C. BU's Response to Allegations Against Motzkin
In response to some of the foregoing allegations and pending their resolution, Berkey, by letter dated October 6, 1994, relieved *988 Motzkin of all teaching and other responsibilities. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. A: letter from Berkey to Motzkin of 10/6/94.) The letter referred to and invoked the CLA Policy on Sexual Harassment (the ""CLA Policy""). (Aff.Pl.'s Counsel Verifying Docs. Re: Count VII Relating to Violation of Univ. Policies and Procedures (""Aff.Pl.'s Counsel""), docket no. 29, Ex.B.) It also warned Motzkin that ""[t]he matters are of such gravity that they may provide a basis for seeking the termination of your employment for cause."" (Letter of 10/6/94 at 1.)
It is unclear from the record what precise steps BU took to resolve the complaints against Motzkin under the CLA Policy. That issue is immaterial, however, because BU did not purport to terminate Motzkin pursuant to the CLA Policy. Rather, it purported to do so pursuant to the different set of university-wide policies and procedures set forth in the Handbook and which the Handbook, by its terms, makes applicable to all BU faculty members.[2] Therefore, in the discussion below, consideration will be given only to the investigation and adjudication of the allegations against Motzkin that purportedly took place in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in the Handbook.
As noted, relevant excerpts from the Handbook are included in the record. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. C; Aff.Pl.'s Counsel Ex.C.) In essence, the Handbook lays out a several-step process for the resolution of questions raised regarding ""the fitness of a faculty member ... whose term of appointment has not expired."" (Handbook at 67-69.) First, an attempt is made to resolve the matter informally through discussion at the administrative level. (Id. at 68.) Second, if informal, administrative resolution is not achieved, an  hoc committee of three faculty members is appointed to attempt to mediate a settlement or, if that too is unsuccessful, to recommend to the Provost whether ""formal proceedings should be instituted."" (Id.) Third, formal proceedings are instituted if either the  hoc committee or the Provost determines that it is appropriate to proceed further. (Id.) At that point, the Provost and the committee are required jointly to prepare a detailed statement of the grounds for suspension or termination, or, if they cannot agree on how to proceed, the Provost may prepare such statement unilaterally. (Id.) Then, pursuant to procedures prescribed in the Handbook, a committee of five faculty members is selected to hear the charges and a hearing is conducted. (Id.)
The accused faculty member is assured various rights in connection with the hearing, including the right to respond in writing and orally to the charges against him or her, to be represented by counsel, to call and confront witnesses and introduce evidence, and to demand that certain evidence be produced. (Id. at 68-69.) The Handbook also provides, however, that ""the hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner reasonably calculated to ascertain the truth and shall not be limited by formal rules of evidence or other restrictions usually employed in legal proceedings."" (Id. at 69.) Following the hearing, the committee must make a decision within ten days. (Id.) Specifically, it must make ""explicit findings with respect to each of the charges presented."" (Id.) Further, ""if warranted,"" it shall ""recommend suspension, termination, or other appropriate discipline."" (Id.) Once it has completed its work, it delivers its report to the faculty member, the Provost, and the President. (Id.) The President then ""may either reject the recommendation and terminate the proceedings"" or forward the report to the Trustees, with or without his or her own recommendation.[3] (Id.) The Trustees then make *989 a decision regarding disciplinary action, which decision, as noted, ""shall be final."" (Id.) At that point, restrictions on publicity are lifted and any announcement of the Trustees' decision must ""include a statement of the Hearing Committee's findings."" (Id.)
Various documents included in Exhibit D to the Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint (docket no. 8) reflect BU's compliance with the Handbook's pre-hearing procedural requirements. The earliest document in Exhibit D is a copy of a letter dated December 23, 1994, to the Provost from the three-member  hoc committee appointed to consider the charges then pending against Motzkin. In the letter, the  hoc committee reported its unanimous recommendation that formal proceedings be instituted. The next document in Exhibit D is a copy of a letter dated January 11, 1995, from the Provost to Motzkin in which the Provost advised Motzkin that he had accepted the  hoc committee's recommendation and was enclosing the formal statement of charges that the Provost had formulated, ""in consultation with the committee."" The enclosed statement of charges described in detail most of the allegations set forth above. It omitted, however, any reference to the allegations that were contained in the May 1994 memorandum to Berkey from the faculty member, presumably because the faculty member was still unwilling to press charges. Another document included in Exhibit D is a copy of a letter dated January 25, 1995, from the Provost to Motzkin. The January 25 letter informed Motzkin that the charges against him had been amended to include the allegations of the faculty member who had, until then, ""been unwilling ... to permit her testimony to be used."" A detailed statement of the new charge was included, and Motzkin was given an additional fourteen days to prepare his response.
While BU was considering the charges against Motzkin in the fall of 1994, it received a letter dated November 21, 1994, from the attorney who was then representing Motzkin, Douglas T. Schwarz. (Def.'s Mem.Ex.B.) The letter purported to advise BU of ""new information"" regarding a ""depressive disorder"" from which Motzkin was purportedly suffering that, in combination with the medication he was taking and other factors, might have reduced his inhibitions, impaired his judgment, and caused him to ""[take] a female student to dinner off-campus, inattentive to Dean Berkey's earlier letter about precisely this point."" (Id. at 1-2.) The letter claimed that Motzkin was again under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Johnson (""Johnson""), and that Johnson was hopeful that, with appropriate treatment, including an anti-depressant medication called Zoloft, ""it is extremely unlikely that [Motzkin] will engage in inappropriate behavior in the future."" (Id.) The letter went on to state: Dr. Motzkin's primary depressive disorder is a handicap under both state and federal law. The University's obligation under such circumstances is to accommodate a person with a handicap unless the accommodation required would impose an undue hardship. I believe that the reasonable accommodation requirement here entails the University monitoring Dr. Motzkin's progress using Zoloft under Dr. Johnson's care. If, as Dr. Johnson believes will be the case, the medication continues to substantially improve the situation, there would seem to be no legitimate reason for preventing Dr. Motzkin from returning to teaching. I suggest that if his improvement is enduring, it would be appropriate that he return to teaching as soon as is practically possible.
(Id. at 2.) This was the first communication that BU received from any source notifying it that Motzkin claimed to suffer from a *990 disability or that the erratic behavior in which he allegedly had engaged might be attributable to it.
By mid-January 1995, the five-member faculty committee appointed to hear the charges against Motzkin (the ""Hearing Committee"") had been appointed. (Def.'s Resp., docket no. 34, Ex. 3: Klafter Aff. ¶ 5.) It began conducting hearings on or about February 20, 1995. (Am.Compl. ¶ 16.) Motzkin was given the opportunity to testify, but, on advice of counsel, he chose to remain silent. (Pl. Motzkin's Opp'n Mot. Dismiss or Summ.J. (""Pl.'s Opp'n""), docket no. 11, at 3 n. 5; Def.'s Mem.Ex. E: Report of the Hearing Committee Considering the Proposed Suspension or Termination for Cause of Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin (the ""Report"") at 1.)[4] Over a period of several days, numerous witnesses apparently did testify either in person or by affidavit, including Johnson and BU's own psychiatric expert, Dr. Louis Vachon (""Vachon""). Motzkin was represented throughout by counsel, and he attended all but the last day of hearings. (Report at 1.) During the course of the hearings, the Hearing Committee heard and ruled upon numerous objections and motions, some of which are the subject of this lawsuit and are discussed in more detail below.
On March 21, 1995, the Hearing Committee issued the Report. It ""found the witnesses to be clear, forthright and credible,"" and it found the ""evidence regarding manipulative, deceptive and harassing behavior on the part of Professor Motzkin"" to be ""compelling and believable."" (Id.) Further, although not necessarily dispositive of the issue of discrimination that Motzkin has raised in this court, the Hearing Committee considered and rejected such claim: Professor Motzkin's attorney argued that the University failed to take action to accommodate Professor Motzkin's alleged conditions or facilitate treatment of them. We have not found sufficient evidence to support this conclusion. Professor Motzkin was repeatedly counseled by superiors concerning the unacceptability of his behavior and the potential consequences to his career. Nevertheless, his pattern of manipulation, deceit and harassment continued into the autumn of 1994. During this period, Professor Motzkin neither claimed an impairment nor sought accommodation for it. The Committee is not persuaded that Professor Motzkin's newly claimed impairment can either excuse or provide grounds for the University to condone his continued harmful behavior. Whatever actions he may take in the future to address the source of the behavior do not justify, at this present time, his continuance as a faculty member at the University. No evidence was presented that Professor Motzkin will in the foreseeable future modify his behavior.... Neither has he requested help from the University with the behavior, other than on one occasion when he suggested to a superior that he might be fined each time he did an act that was deemed inappropriate. Although Professor Motzkin appears to be a skilled teacher, on the basis of the evidence presented, he does not meet the standard of interpersonal behavior required of a faculty member at Boston University.
(Id. at 5-6.)
The Hearing Committee concluded that ""the charges of harassment, sexual harassment, sexual assault, violation of the University's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol policy and lying against Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin are true and proven."" (Id. at 6.) It unanimously recommended that he be ""terminated for cause."" (Id.)
In accordance with the rules prescribed in the Handbook, the Hearing Committee transmitted the Report to the President. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. F: letter from John Silber to Board of Trustees of 3/22/95.) By letter to the Trustees dated March 22, 1995, the President notified the Trustees of his concurrence with the Hearing Committee's recommendation *991 that Motzkin's appointment ""be terminated for cause effective upon the vote of the Board."" (Id.) The Trustees accepted this recommendation, and Motzkin was notified by letter dated March 31, 1995, that his appointment had been terminated for cause. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. H: letter from John Silber to Motzkin.) 
D. Court Proceedings
Motzkin commenced the present lawsuit in Massachusetts Superior Court on or about February 17, 1995, or three days before the Hearing Committee began hearing testimony. (Compl.; Am.Compl. ¶ 16.) His original complaint contained four counts, including one count for breach of contract (Count II) and three counts for discrimination in violation, respectively, of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93, § 103 (1994) (Count I), of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189 (1994) (Count III),[5] and of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1994) (Count IV). On or about March 3, 1995, BU removed the case to this court on the ground, among others, that a federal question had been asserted. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441(b) (1994). At the end of March or the beginning of April of 1995, BU filed a motion to dismiss (docket no. 6) and a supporting memorandum (docket no. 8). Although BU had purported to file its motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (1) and (6), it attached a number of exhibits to its memorandum and specifically requested that the court treat the motion as one for summary judgment. (Def.'s Mem. at 1.) On or about May 8, 1995, Motzkin filed a pleading entitled ""Plaintiff Motzkin Opposition to Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment,"" and an amended complaint. (Docket nos. 11 and 16.)
Motzkin's amended complaint sets forth eight counts,[6] preceded by a general section entitled ""Statement of the Facts."" The ""Statement of the Facts"" section alleges that Motzkin ""suffers from mental disorders,"" which disorders were purportedly documented in expert testimony that plaintiff submitted under seal with his amended complaint. (Am.Compl. ¶ 8.) It further alleges that Motzkin's mental disorders (and the medication prescribed to treat them) ""cause disinhibition in certain actions so that an individual may engage in inappropriate conduct that otherwise in a non-disabled state the individual's mind inhibitions would forestop."" (Id. ¶ 9.)
As noted, Motzkin's amended complaint was accompanied by, and specifically alluded to, relied upon, and adopted, expert testimony that Motzkin filed under seal in this proceeding and that had originally been submitted at the hearings conducted by the Hearing Committee. (Mot. Impound Two Docs., docket no. 14, and contents.) The filing that Motzkin made under seal in this case consists of two documents: (1) the Affidavit of Dr. Michael Johnson and (2) excerpts compiled by Motzkin's counsel of testimony by a psychiatric expert  Vachon  whom BU had apparently called as a witness at the termination hearing. In his affidavit, Johnson states his opinion that Motzkin suffers from ""depressive disorders"" and sleep apnea, which, in combination, ""impair the Professor's ability to function and have a marked disinhibitive effect on his conduct."" (Johnson Aff. ¶ 5.) Further, despite the use of medication, ""the disorders remain chronic, at times improving, at times worsening."" (Id. ¶ 6.) Johnson concludes that ""Professor Motzkin suffers from disabilities that continue to impair his ability to function and such disabilities would have impaired his ability to recognize and conform his conduct to the boundaries that would appropriately mark the relationship that should separate a professor and his students."" (Id. ¶ 9.) Along the same lines, Vachon, according to Motzkin's own summary of a portion of the testimony *992 that Motzkin adopted and relied upon in his filings with this court, ""confirmed that there would be impairment in both social and occupational functioning, which would render one disabled from serving as a university professor."" (Pl.'s Submission of Excerpts from the Testimony Under Oath of BU's Psychiatric Expert Dr. Louis Vachon Confirming that Professor Motzkin Suffers from Disabilities at 8.)
As noted, the other pleading that Motzkin filed on May 8, 1995, was his opposition to defendant's motion. In his opposition, Motzkin again referred to and adopted the foregoing psychiatric testimony and opinion. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 3.) He agreed that Count I of his original claim, which had alleged discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of state law, was subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust state administrative remedies.[7] (Id. at 4-5.) With respect to the breach of contract count, Motzkin argued that summary judgment was precluded because of factual disputes regarding the existence of a contract, but he did not explain the basis for his claim that there had been a breach, except to state in conclusory terms that the contract ""was wrongfully terminated."" (Id. at 5.) With respect to the ADA count, he did not address BU's argument that Title I of the ADA, to the exclusion of Title III, concerned employment discrimination, but he did argue that BU was a place of public accommodation. (Id. at 6-7.) Finally, he did not at all address BU's arguments that, because, inter alia, he had admitted in his complaint that he was not ""otherwise qualified"" to perform the essential functions of a university professor, Motzkin had failed to state a claim under the Rehabilitation Act.
On or about June 16, 1995, BU filed Defendant's Supplementary Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss. (Docket no. 21.) This supplementary memorandum addressed some of the points Motzkin had raised in his opposition to BU's original motion, as well as the new counts that were included for the first time in Motzkin's amended complaint. Oral argument on BU's motion was heard on July 13, 1995. (Tr.) At the argument, after confirming that counsel had no objection, the court stated that it would treat BU's motion as one for summary judgment. (Id. at 4.) This was confirmed in a Scheduling and Procedural Order entered that date, (docket no. 22), which order also gave Motzkin until August 4, 1995, to file additional evidentiary material and, if he wished to do so, a motion for discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). Motzkin took full advantage of this opportunity to make these supplemental filings. (Docket nos. 24 and 26-30.) He also filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, (docket no. 25), which motion is the subject of a separate memorandum and order entered this date. The voluminous filings concerning the present motion were finally completed in September 1995, upon the filing by BU of its response to Motzkin's supplemental filings, (docket no. 34), and a motion to impound certain documents that Motzkin had filed. (Docket no. 31.) 
II. ANALYSIS 
A. Procedural Considerations
Where, as here, materials ""outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,"" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) authorizes the court to convert a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim into a motion for summary judgment, provided that all parties are given notice and the opportunity to present opposing materials. See Whiting v. Maiolini, 921 F.2d 5, 6-8 (1st Cir.1990). These requirements were satisfied here. The court will thus treat BU's motion as one for summary judgment.
The standard for summary judgment is familiar. Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). At the outset, the moving party must aver that there is ""`an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's'"" position. Garside, 895 F.2d  at 48 (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). *993 To avoid summary judgment, the opposing party must produce affirmative evidence demonstrating a genuine issue for trial. See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S. Ct. 2965, 119 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1992). ""[T]he nonmovant may not rest upon mere allegations, but must adduce specific, provable facts demonstrating that there is a triable issue."" Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888 F.2d 189, 191 (1st Cir.1989). While ""`summary judgment ... should be used sparingly ... where motive and intent play leading roles,'"" Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 895 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S. Ct. 486, 491, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962)), it is nevertheless available where, on the basis of undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law regardless of motive. See, e.g., August v. Offices Unlimited, Inc., 981 F.2d 576, 581-82, 584 (1st Cir.1992) (holding summary judgment for employer proper because employee had conceded he was ""totally disabled"" and thus could not establish prima facie case under state civil rights statute similar to Title I of ADA and section 504 of Rehabilitation Act). In reviewing the nonmovant's case, ""the court must look at the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and must indulge all inferences favorable to that party."" See Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1983) (citation omitted). This court must therefore review the record in the light most favorable to Motzkin to determine whether he has adduced sufficient admissible evidence to raise a triable issue with respect to any of the eight counts of his amended complaint. 
B. Application of Summary Judgment Standard 
Count I
Motzkin asserts in Count I of his amended complaint that his termination violated Title I of the ADA. (Am.Compl. ¶ 26.) Title I prohibits employment discrimination ""against a qualified individual with a disability,"" defined as a person who can perform the ""essential functions"" of his or her job, with or without reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8), 12112; see also Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406-07, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979).[8] In response, BU argues, inter alia, that Motzkin was hired to be a teacher, but, by his own admission, he is not qualified to teach. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem. at 3-4; Def.'s Mem. at 12-16.) It further notes that Motzkin's own expert has opined that Motzkin has an impaired ""ability to recognize and conform his conduct to the boundaries that would appropriately mark the relationship that should separate a professor and his students."" (Def.'s Resp. at 6.) It also points out that Motzkin himself, by quoting Vachon's testimony, supports BU's argument that no genuine issue exists concerning whether Motzkin can perform the responsibilities of his former job. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem. at 4.) BU argues that, under these circumstances, Motzkin is clearly not qualified to teach, and teaching is without doubt an essential  indeed, the defining  function of the appointment that is the subject of this lawsuit. (Def.'s Mem. at 13-14; Def.'s Resp. at 6-7.) Thus, even assuming, arguendo, that Motzkin is an individual with a ""disability"" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) and that, contrary to the evidence, he was discharged not for his offensive conduct but ""because of the disability,"" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), he is still not entitled to relief under Title I of the ADA.
The court was (and still is) unable to locate within any of Motzkin's many filings even a purported response to this seemingly irrefutable argument. For that reason, the court inquired pointedly at the oral argument whether it is Motzkin's position that ""he is presently qualified as a result of the treatment *994 he is now receiving,"" to which his counsel responded, ""No."" (Tr. at 50.) The court then asked whether Motzkin agrees that ""he is not presently qualified [i.e., even with the treatment he is receiving] to be placed in a classroom teaching University students,"" to which his counsel responded, ""Yes, but that is not the full range of the definition of a professor."" (Id.) In an attempt to understand this last response, the court inquired whether it was Motzkin's position that, even if he was hired to teach, BU had an ""obligation to accommodate [him] by putting him in a nonteaching position."" (Id. at 51.) His counsel responded, ""It's not my position."" (Id.) When pressed to explain her position, however, counsel noted that professors do other things besides teaching, including research and writing, curriculum development, and grading examinations. (Id. at 53.) Motzkin's position thus seems to be that BU has an obligation to create a ""teaching"" position for Motzkin in which he would have all the responsibilities that other teachers have, with the notable exception of teaching.
Motzkin's argument must be rejected. Whatever incidental, non-teaching responsibilities other professors at BU might have, it is undisputed that Motzkin, consistent with his own preference, was given a special teaching appointment that required him to teach three courses per semester in the Core Curriculum and Department of Philosophy.[9] If he is unable to teach the courses that he was hired to teach, someone else will presumably have to teach them. Conversely, he was not hired to do research, or design curricula, or grade examinations, and BU certainly would not have given him the special appointment it did if that were all he was qualified to do. In light of Berkey's December 4, 1992, letter offering Motzkin a ""special appointment, with primary emphasis on the teaching role,"" it simply cannot be disputed that teaching is an essential function of Motzkin's job.
Moreover, even if teaching were not an essential function of Motzkin's special appointment, there is no more reason to believe that Motzkin can be trusted to work in proximity to female colleagues  whether in the library, or on committees, or in other locations or capacities  than to teach female students. Whether or not Motzkin did the things he was accused of doing, there is no place in a university community for someone who is as incapable of controlling his impulses as Motzkin insists he is. See Mazzarella v. United States Postal Serv., 849 F. Supp. 89, 96 (D.Mass.1994) (""Finally, and most importantly, the record demonstrates that no amount of accommodation by [the Postal Service] would necessarily protect its employees and its property from the plaintiff's potential fits."") Therefore, even if teaching were not an essential function of Motzkin's particular appointment, his proposal that he merely be removed from the classroom as a form of ""reasonable accommodation"" would be unacceptable.
Because Motzkin is incapable, with or without accommodation, of performing the essential functions of his job, there is no need to consider BU's other arguments regarding flaws in Motzkin's claim under Title I of the ADA. It should be noted, however, that case law supports a number of BU's alternative arguments. See Little v. FBI, 1 F.3d 255, 259 (4th Cir.1993) (employer subject to Rehabilitation Act must be allowed to terminate employee for ""egregious misconduct"" regardless of whether employee has a disability); Mazzarella, 849 F. Supp.  at 97 (termination of an employee for improper conduct does not constitute discrimination because of a disability pursuant to Rehabilitation Act, even if the improper conduct is attributable to a disability); August, 981 F.2d  at 580-81  n. 4 (an employer has no obligation to offer another job to employee who, because of a disability, is unable to do the job he or she was hired to perform); Taub v. Frank, 957 F.2d 8, 11-12 (1st Cir.1992) (no liability under Rehabilitation Act for employer's failure to identify and offer treatment for an undisclosed disability that contributes to behavior that constitutes grounds for termination).
For all the foregoing reasons, I recommend that Count I of the amended complaint be dismissed. 

*995 Count II

Count II of the amended complaint states a claim similar to Count I, except that it is brought under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 rather than the ADA. (Am.Compl. ¶ 27.) I recommend dismissal of Count II for the same reason I recommend dismissal of Count I. By his own admission, Motzkin is unfit to teach; therefore, he is not an ""otherwise qualified individual with a disability,"" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). 
Count III
Count III of the amended complaint purports to state a claim under Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189. (Am. Compl. ¶ 28.) Title III addresses, among other things, discrimination on the basis of disability by places of public accommodation. Specifically, Title III proscribes discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to ""the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation."" See id. § 12182(a).
The parties' memoranda are somewhat confusing because they tend to deal with two separate issues without clearly distinguishing between them.[10] The first issue is whether Title III covers only physical access to the structures in which businesses that otherwise would be places of public accommodation are located. Some courts have answered this question in the affirmative, see, e.g., Parker v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 875 F. Supp. 1321, 1327-28 (W.D.Tenn.1995) (""Title III only addresses discrimination based on a disabled person's physical abilities to make use of the goods and services of a place of public accommodation""), but the First Circuit has read Title III more broadly. See Carparts Distribution Ctr., Inc. v. Automotive Wholesalers Ass'n of New England, Inc., 37 F.3d 12, 18-20 (1st Cir.1994). The Title III question in Carparts was whether a business could be a place of public accommodation notwithstanding that members of the public did not physically have to go to it in order to purchase goods or services, see id. at 18, which question is not presented here. Nevertheless, in holding that a business could be a place of public accommodation under these circumstances, the court necessarily discussed the closely related question whether Title III deals only with physical access to places of public accommodation. See id. at 18-20. Again, the court read Title III broadly: Neither Title III nor its implementing regulations make any mention of physical boundaries or physical entry. Many goods and services are sold over the telephone or by mail with customers never physically entering the premises of a commercial entity to purchase the goods or services. To exclude this broad category of businesses from the reach of Title III and limit the application of Title III to physical structures which persons must enter to obtain goods and services would run afoul of the purposes of the ADA and would severely frustrate Congress's intent that individuals with disabilities fully enjoy the goods, services, privileges and advantages, available indiscriminately to other members of the general public.
Id. at 20.
Despite this language, BU argues that, as a matter of law, Title III applies only ""to issues of physical access to places of public accommodations."" (Def.'s Mem. at 11.) Carparts clearly rejects this argument. On the other hand, Motzkin also clearly misses the mark when he construes the quoted passage as dispositive of the separate and more relevant of the two issues that BU raises: does Title III deal at all with employment discrimination, or is employment discrimination the exclusive domain of Title I? Since Carparts does not address this question, other sources must be considered.
I first consider the statutory language. Title III proscribes discrimination ""in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation."" See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). While it *996 could be argued that the terms ""privileges"" and ""advantages,"" in the abstract, are general enough to encompass employment opportunities, one does not ordinarily think of jobs as being among the ""privileges"" and ""advantages"" offered to members of the public by places of public accommodation. Title I, on the other hand, is entitled ""Employment,"" and, by its terms, it clearly applies to virtually all aspects of the employment relationship, See id. § 12112 (proscribing discrimination in regard to ""job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment""). Indeed, even with respect to physical (and other) accessibility issues within the employment context, it is Title I, not Title III, that directly addresses the area. Specifically, Title I provides that an employer's duty to make reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities may include ""making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities."" See id. § 12111(9) (A).[11] The legislative intent is so clear from the language of Titles I and III that one need not go beyond that language to conclude that employment discrimination is the exclusive province of Title I.
I proceed, nevertheless, to consider precedent. At least one case is squarely on point, and that case holds that ""Title III does not govern employment practices."" See Parker, 875 F. Supp.  at 1328. In reaching its conclusion, the Parker court cited the following instructive excerpt from the legislative history of the ADA: ""Title III is not intended to govern any terms or conditions of employment by providers of public accommodations ... employment practices are governed by title I of this legislation."" Id. (citing S.Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 58 (1989)).
Finally, as a matter of policy, it would make no sense to construe Title III as including employment practices within its scope. Indeed, to do so might wreak havoc with the careful balance that Congress attempted to strike in Title I between the rights of employers and the rights of workers with disabilities. For example, the term ""qualified individual with a disability"" appears in Title I, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8), 12112, but is absent from Title III. As a result, if Title III were construed to apply to employment practices, an employer would be within its rights under Title I, but might be liable under Title III, if it denied employment to an individual who, because of a disability, was incapable of performing the essential functions of the job.
I conclude that Title III does not apply to employment discrimination. For this reason, and because Motzkin does not otherwise allege a violation of Title III, I recommend that Count III of the amended complaint be dismissed. 
Count IV
Count IV of the amended complaint, a barebones claim for breach of contract, states, in its entirety, ""The University's termination of Professor Motzkin['s] employment contract constitutes a breach of the mutual rights and obligations of the employment contract."" (Am.Compl. ¶ 29.) Nowhere within the amended complaint or Motzkin's other filings does Motzkin state any particular respect in which BU allegedly failed to honor any promise it made to him, other than to claim that BU terminated his contract prematurely and improperly. (Id. ¶ 1.) For this reason, the court specifically asked Motzkin's counsel at oral argument to identify the alleged breaches. (Tr. at 63.) Counsel identified three: a contract right not to be terminated in violation of the ADA; a contract right not to have the charges against him amended in violation of the procedures set forth in the Handbook; and a contract right that he not be terminated without an impartial termination hearing, or, more specifically, a hearing in which the clerk appointed by the Hearing Committee is not ""an arm of the prosecutor."" (Id. at 63-66.)
*997 It is important to note that Motzkin does not dispute that his contract may be terminated early for cause or that cause would include conduct of the type in which the Hearing Committee found he had engaged. These implicit concessions, in conjunction with Motzkin's admission that he suffers from a disinhibitory disorder that renders him unfit to teach and prone to engage in offensive behavior of the same type that he was charged with, would appear to be dispositive of all his contract claims. Thus, as noted, there can be no violation of the ADA, and, therefore, no breach of contract pursuant to Motzkin's theory that the contract incorporates the ADA, if Motzkin is incapable of performing the essential functions of his job.[12] Similarly, BU's alleged failure to observe certain procedural formalities prescribed by the Handbook would appear to be immaterial, since the outcome of a hearing conducted in a manner that Motzkin would deem ""procedurally proper"" would be the same, given Motzkin's concession that BU has the right to terminate his contract for cause and his admission that disinhibitory disorders render him unfit to teach.
Thus there is no need, in light of Motzkin's concessions and admissions, to consider Motzkin's two contract claims relating to procedures. In the interest of thoroughness, however, I will briefly review them to demonstrate that neither has merit.
First, Motzkin complains about an allegedly improper amendment of the charges against him to include the complaints documented by the faculty member in her May 1994 memorandum to Berkey. (Am.Compl. ¶ 33; Aff.Pl.'s Counsel ¶¶ 1-4, 6.) The gravamen of Motzkin's complaint is that it was a violation of BU's policies and procedures, and, thus, a breach of his contract, to allow the Hearing Committee to consider this particular charge before it had been considered by the Sexual Harassment Committee. (Id. ¶¶ 1-4, 6, Ex. D: Professor Motzkin's Mot. Limit Matters Before Faculty Committee Hearing.)
The first problem with this complaint is that it confuses the CLA Policy, which includes as one step in its process a hearing before a three-person  hoc subcommittee of the CLA's Sexual Harassment Committee, (CLA Policy at 7), with the separate procedures prescribed in the Handbook. (Handbook at 67-69.) Neither the CLA Sexual Harassment Committee nor the three-person  hoc subcommittee of the CLA Sexual Harassment Committee plays any role in disciplinary proceedings commenced pursuant to the Handbook, except that one option available to the CLA  hoc subcommittee is to recommend that the dean initiate action to discipline or terminate the accused pursuant to university procedures. (CLA Policy at 8.) Under the Handbook procedures, the first step in the disciplinary process, if the matter cannot be resolved informally, is to refer the matter to an  hoc committee of three faculty members, which committee is distinct from the CLA  hoc subcommittee. (Handbook at 68.) If the  hoc committee is unable to settle the charges, it makes ""a recommendation as to whether formal proceedings should be instituted."" (Id.) Significantly, however, the Provost may decide that formal proceedings be commenced even if the  hoc committee had recommended otherwise. (Id.)
Given this structure, it is difficult to see how Motzkin could have suffered any prejudice as a result of the failure of the  hoc committee to consider the faculty member's charges. The  hoc committee considered all the other charges and recommended that formal proceedings be commenced as to those. It is inconceivable that, if the faculty member's additional charges had also been considered, the  hoc committee would not have recommended formal proceedings as to the charges that it did consider. Although it is possible that the  hoc committee would not have recommended that the formal proceedings include the faculty member's charges, the Provost would still have had the authority, pursuant to the Handbook, to make a unilateral decision to include them *998 anyway. (Id.) Under these circumstances, where it was the Provost who notified Motzkin of the decision to amend the charges to include the faculty member's complaint, no purpose would have been served to reconvene the  hoc committee solely to have it consider the faculty member's complaint.[13]
Motzkin's second complaint regarding the hearing procedures is that the clerk to the Hearing Committee, Craig Klafter (""Klafter""), an Assistant to the Provost, allegedly worked actively with the BU prosecuting attorney and participated in the Hearing Committee's decision-making. (Am.Compl. ¶¶ 20, 32; Particularized Req. Disc. Under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(f) Re Count VII, docket no. 28, at 2.) Motzkin's claim is apparently that Klafter's role detracted from the impartiality of the proceedings. Again, there are several problems with this theory.
First, there is no evidence that Klafter participated in the Hearing Committee's decision-making. To the contrary, each member of the Hearing Committee, and Klafter himself, has submitted an affidavit confirming that his duties were purely administrative.[14] (Def.'s Resp.Exs. 1, 3, 4.) The Hearing Committee made all the decisions and Klafter merely reduced them to writing after the committee had communicated them to him and reported them to the parties and their counsel. (E.g., id. Ex. 1: Garland Aff. ¶¶ 7, 12.)
Second, Motzkin seems to assume that, if Klafter or the Provost for whom he was an assistant had any role in investigating the underlying charges or recommending that they proceed to formal adjudication, Klafter would be disqualified from participating in the subsequent adjudication. But courts have repeatedly held in the administrative law context that it is not a violation of due process when persons much more involved in the investigative phase of a case than either Klafter or the Provost was participate directly in the adjudicative phase. See, e.g., Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 46-55, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 1464-68, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975); Blinder, Robinson  Co. v. SEC, 837 F.2d 1099, 1104-08 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 869, 109 S. Ct. 177, 102 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1988). In the complete absence of any evidence of bias or partiality by Klafter, there is no reason to assume that Klafter's position as Assistant to the Provost, per se, would have rendered the proceedings unfair, even if Klafter, contrary to the evidence, had participated in decision-making. See Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 997-98 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 912, 111 S. Ct. 1122, 113 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1991); Greenberg v. Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 968 F.2d 164, 167-68 (2d Cir.1992) (although law clerk of administrative law judge had previously participated in investigation of case, judge not disqualified because law clerk played only ministerial role in adjudicatory process).[15]
There is a third problem with Motzkin's theory, but it relates only to one specific charge by Motzkin regarding Klafter's role. As he states in his affidavit, Klafter was dispatched by the Chairman of the Hearing Committee to interview a potential thirdparty *999 witness to determine whether the potential witness had any information that might be relevant to the pending charges. (Klafter Aff. ¶ 8.) Klafter, accompanied by an attorney from BU's Office of General Counsel and a student complainant, interviewed the witness for this purpose and tape-recorded the interview, without an expectation that the witness would be unavailable to attend the hearing. (Id.) As it turned out, the witness was on a work release program from a Massachusetts correctional institution. (Id.) By the time he was to testify, his work release status had been revoked, and he had been reincarcerated in the correctional institution. (Id.) Thus, he could not attend the hearing. (Garland Aff. ¶ 11.) The Hearing Committee offered Motzkin the option of convening the hearing at the correctional institution so that the witness's live testimony could be obtained, but Motzkin declined this offer. (Id.; Def.'s Resp.Ex. 2 at 2-3.) Consequently, the Hearing Committee decided to admit the tape-recorded interview, pursuant to clear Handbook authority. (Id.) Particularly where this decision was made only after Motzkin had declined an offer that would have enabled the witness to give live testimony and that would have fully preserved Motzkin's right of cross-examination, there was no deprivation of ""basic fairness."" See Cloud v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 720 F.2d 721, 725 (1st Cir.1983).
To summarize, because Motzkin concedes that he can be terminated for cause and is unfit to do the job he was hired to perform, his complaints about procedural unfairness of the process by which BU determined that cause for termination existed are immaterial. Even if his charges were material, there was no breach of contract because BU's procedures were fundamentally fair and in substantial compliance with those prescribed in the Handbook. For these reasons, I recommend that Count IV be dismissed. 
Count V
Count V of the amended complaint, entitled ""Wrongful Termination,"" consists of the following sentence: ""The University has wrongfully terminated the employment of Professor Motzkin."" (Am.Compl. ¶ 30.) Motzkin does not elaborate on or even mention this claim in any of his filings. BU reasonably assumes in its supplementary memorandum that this count purports to state a claim under cases such as Fortune v. National Cash Register Co., 373 Mass. 96, 364 N.E.2d 1251 (1977) and Gram v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 384 Mass. 659, 429 N.E.2d 21 (1981), which deal with the rights of at-will employees. As BU points out, however, Motzkin was not an at-will employee; he was an employee for a term of years who was terminated for cause. Moreover, there is no allegation that his termination was in violation of any public policy or in bad faith for the purpose of depriving him of compensation he had already earned. Therefore, the Fortune line of cases would seem to have no application here. Because there appears to be no other basis for a claim for ""wrongful termination,"" and because Motzkin has shed no light on the subject, I recommend dismissal of Count V. 
Count VI
Count VI of the amended complaint is entitled ""Estoppel"" and appears to assert that BU is estopped to terminate Motzkin because, among other reasons, it did not promptly commence disciplinary hearings at the first sign of a problem. (Am.Comp. ¶ 31.) This claim is clearly without merit. In order for there to be an estoppel, there must be some promise or representation by the party against whom the estoppel is asserted which induced reasonable, detrimental reliance by the person asserting the estoppel. Cadrin v. New England Tel.  Tel. Co., 828 F. Supp. 120, 122-23 (D.Mass.1993) (citations omitted); O'Blenes v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 397 Mass. 555, 492 N.E.2d 354, 356 (1986). Motzkin has neither pled any of these elements nor produced any evidence that BU made any promise or representation that Motzkin would not be held accountable for his alleged offensive behavior. To the contrary, on each occasion that BU became aware of a problem, it raised the matter with Motzkin and urged him to act appropriately. The fact that it did not bring formal charges against or formally reprimand him prior to 1993 is attributable to the unwillingness of any complainant to press formal charges until that time. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem. at 9.) *1000 Further, Motzkin cannot allege in good faith that he continued to engage in offensive conduct in reliance on the belief that BU had promised him or otherwise represented to him that he was free to do so. Finally, any reliance by Motzkin on such purported promise or representation that he could, with impunity, sexually harass students or sexually assault or harass faculty members would clearly be unreasonable as a matter of law. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994); Lipsett, 864 F.2d  at 896-901.
I therefore recommend that Count VI be dismissed. 
Count VII
Count VII, entitled ""Violation of Fair Process Rights in the Internal Hearing,"" (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 32-33), merely restates the complaints regarding alleged procedural flaws that were addressed above in the discussion of the breach of contract count, Count IV. For the reasons stated in the above section, those allegations are meritless. I therefore recommend that Count VII be dismissed. 
Count VIII
Count VIII is entitled ""Defamation,"" and consists solely of this sentence: ""The University defamed Plaintiff Motzkin and sought to cast him in a false light by filing as a public record in the Court confidential materials not subject to impoundment and by leaking distorted information to the press  all causing great harm to the reputation and privacy of Professor Motzkin.""[16] (Id. ¶ 34.)
To the extent that Motzkin seeks to allege a cause of action for defamation based upon BU's public filings with this court, such claim is barred by the absolute privilege applicable to statements made in the course of litigation, as long as the statements, as they do here, pertain to that litigation. E.g., Correllas v. Viveiros, 410 Mass. 314, 572 N.E.2d 7, 10 (1991) (""Statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding which pertain to that proceeding are, of course, absolutely privileged and cannot support a claim of defamation, even if uttered with malice or in bad faith"").[17] With respect to the ""false light"" claim, Massachusetts has declined repeated invitations to recognize this tort. See, e.g., ELM Medical Lab., Inc. v. RKO Gen., Inc., 403 Mass. 779, 532 N.E.2d 675, 681 (1989), modified by United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 406 Mass. 811, 551 N.E.2d 20, 23 (1990). Even if it were now inclined to do so, the tort of invasion of privacy by casting someone in a false light would no doubt be subject to the absolute privilege applicable to statements made in the course of judicial proceedings that pertain to that proceeding. See Correllas, 572 N.E.2d  at 13 (claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress must fail if based on absolutely privileged statements, because ""[a] privilege which protected an individual from liability for defamation would be of little value if the individual were subject to liability under a different theory of tort"").
I therefore recommend that Count VIII be dismissed. 
III. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
For all the foregoing reasons, I recommend that summary judgment be granted to *1001 BU on all eight counts of the amended complaint. 
IV. IMPORTANT NOTICE OF RIGHT TO OBJECT AND WAIVER OF RIGHT TO APPEAL FOR FAILURE TO DO SO WITHIN TEN DAYS
The parties are hereby advised that under the provisions of Rule 3(b) of the Rules for United States Magistrates in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, any party who objects to these proposed findings and recommendations must file a written objection thereto with the Clerk of this Court WITHIN 10 DAYS of the party's receipt of this Report and Recommendation. The written objections must specifically identify the portion of the proposed findings, recommendations, or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The parties are further advised that the United States Court of Appeals for this Circuit has indicated that failure to comply with this rule shall preclude further appellate review by the Court of Appeals of the District Court's order entered pursuant to this Report and Recommendation. See United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.1986); Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603 (1st Cir.1980); United States v. Vega, 678 F.2d 376 (1st Cir.1982); Scott v. Schweiker, 702 F.2d 13 (1st Cir.1983); see also Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985).
NOTES
[1]  For reasons stated in a separate Memorandum and Order issued this date, Motzkin's related (but non-dispositive) motions for discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) and for leave to file a second amended complaint are denied.
[2]  By their terms, the CLA Policy and the Handbook policies and procedures are not mutually exclusive, and there is nothing in the record that suggests that they are. Therefore, BU could presumably have proceeded against Motzkin directly under the Handbook procedures, bypassing the CLA Policy entirely.
[3]  The Handbook neither states nor implies that the President has the right to substitute his or her findings for those of the committee or to recommend to the Trustees that a faculty member be disciplined in a case in which the committee, for whatever reason, did not make such recommendation. Further, it would not make sense in the context of the elaborate hearing structure mandated by the Handbook to find such right by implication. It thus appears that the President and, ultimately, the Trustees act in effect as a board of clemency, with power to reject the committee's recommendation, if any, that the faculty member be disciplined, but without independent authority to impose discipline if the committee has not made such recommendation. Although, for reasons discussed below, I need not reach the question in this case of the weight to be given to the committee's findings or the Trustees' decision, it should be noted that these procedures differ in material respects from those involved in McConnell v. Howard Univ., 818 F.2d 58, 62, 67-70 (D.C.Cir.1987) (because university board of trustees was not bound by decision of faculty hearing committee in favor of tenured faculty member, court declined to give any effect either to findings of hearing committee or to decision by board of trustees to overrule those findings and impose discipline).
[4]  In her opposition to the present motion, Motzkin's counsel states, ""Professor Motzkin, on advice of counsel, could not testify to define the factual disputes  leaving his factual story to be told in this lawsuit."" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 3 n. 5. (emphasis added).) No explanation is given and there appears to be no basis for the assertion that Motzkin ""could"" not testify. As discussed below, however, all this is immaterial in light of Motzkin's concession that he is unfit to teach.
[5]  Title III of the ADA deals with discrimination with respect to public accommodations. The original complaint did not include a claim under Title I, which deals with employment discrimination.
[6]  The eight counts were as follows: discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of Title I of the ADA (Count I), of the Rehabilitation Act (Count II), and of Title III of the ADA (Count III); breach of contract (Count IV); wrongful termination (Count V); estoppel (Count VI); violation of fair process rights in the internal termination hearing (Count VII); and defamation (Count VIII).
[7]  Motzkin's amended complaint does not include a claim under state law for discrimination on the basis of disability.
[8]  Because the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act contain similar language, courts have applied decisions based on the Rehabilitation Act to interpret the ADA. Larkins v. CIBA Vision Corp., 858 F. Supp. 1572, 1583 n. 4 (N.D.Ga.1994); see also Parker v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 875 F. Supp. 1321, 1325 (W.D.Tenn.1995) (ADA case noting that analysis under prior Rehabilitation Act case is instructive because ADA provisions are to be construed consistently with similar Rehabilitation Act requirements).
[9]  The court expresses no opinion about whether teaching is an ""essential function"" of even non-specially appointed faculty members, other than to say that it would be surprising if it were not.
[10]  Motzkin contends, and BU does not deny, that BU is a place of public accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7) (J) (including undergraduate and postgraduate schools and other places of education as public accommodations, provided that their operations affect commerce).
[11]  In addition, the Regulations to Implement the Equal Employment Provisions of the ADA specifically state that their purpose is ""to implement title I of the [ADA], requiring equal employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities,"" and several other ADA sections, none of which sections is located in Title III. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.1(a).
[12]  In fact, Motzkin concedes, as he must, that his incorporation claim must fail if his ADA claims lack merit. (Tr. at 64-65.) Since I have concluded for reasons already stated that Motzkin's ADA claims lack merit, I will give no further consideration to this aspect of Motzkin's breach of contract claim.
[13]  As noted, the Provost gave Motzkin an additional fourteen days to respond to the faculty member's complaint, and Motzkin does not contend that this was inadequate. Nor does Motzkin suggest that the  hoc committee's failure to consider the faculty member's complaint deprived him of an opportunity to settle it before the Hearing Committee considered it. Indeed, Motzkin could have attempted to settle that complaint in the additional fourteen days afforded to him for preparation.
[14]  One of Motzkin's motions for discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) sought discovery regarding Klafter's role. (Docket no. 28.) For reasons set forth in a separate Memorandum and Order issued this date, this motion is denied.
[15]  As BU has pointed out, all the faculty members on the Hearing Committee were themselves employees of BU, and, in that sense, they would all equally be vulnerable to the charge that they might be subject to undue influence. In the absence of any evidence that BU might have attempted to exert undue influence or that any member of the Hearing Committee might have succumbed to it or was otherwise biased, the faculty members' employee status, per se, would surely not be a basis for disqualification. See Greenberg, 968 F.2d  at 167 (fact that administrative law judges are employees of agency whose actions they review is not a basis for disqualification). If it were, a procedure that was clearly designed to protect the accused faculty member by inserting a committee of his or her peers as a buffer between him or her and the administration could never serve its beneficial purpose.
[16]  Count VIII is the subject of Motzkin's motion to amend. By separate Memorandum and Order entered this date, Motzkin's motion is denied.
[17]  Motzkin did not move to place the allegedly offending materials under seal. Had he done so, it is unlikely that the court would have granted such motion, assuming that it even would have had any discretion in the matter. See Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1986) (suggesting that there may be a ""right of public access to documents considered in rulings on dispositive pretrial motions,"" and citing Second and Seventh Circuit decisions recognizing such right). In any event, despite Motzkin's unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, the information was surely not confidential, since (1) the Handbook expressly provides that ""[a]nnouncement of the Trustees' final decision shall include a statement of the Hearing Committee's findings, if this has not previously been made known"" (Handbook at 69), and (2) this Report and Recommendation, which necessarily includes a statement of the reasons for my recommendation, is and must be a public document. In addition, before BU filed the allegedly offending materials, one of the complaining students disclosed detailed information to the press, (Klafter Aff. ¶¶ 14-16), and Motzkin himself gave a detailed account of the situation from his perspective to an Israeli news reporter for publication in an Israeli news magazine. (Def.'s Resp.Ex. 5: Elswit Aff. ¶¶ 7-8 and attached article dated 4/2/95, the title of which was translated as ""I Kept My Hands to Myself."")


					"
https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/20/boston-u-moves-terminate-professor-after-investigation-sexual-harassment-claims,"Boston University said Friday that it found evidence of harassment in a case involving David Marchant, a well-known geologist -- enough to initiate termination proceedings against him.
Marchant, who was until recently chair of the department of earth and environment at Boston, remains a professor but is now on paid administrative leave, Provost Jean Morrison said in a statement. The university’s 13-month investigation was prompted by claims of harassment by one of Marchant’s former graduate students but involved interviews and statements from more than 30 witnesses and some 1,000 pages of records.
Many details of the case have since become public, due to media coverage. The matter is also the subject of a separate investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology.
Marchant’s primary accuser is Jane Willenbring, now an associate professor of geology at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. She says that Marchant harassed her during a 1999 research trip to Antarctica, when he was still an assistant professor at Boston. Marchant allegedly pressured Willenbring to have sex with his brother, who was also on the trip, and called her a ""slut"" and a ""whore."" Willenbring also says Marchant pelted her with rocks while she was urinating outside and purposely blew volcanic ash into her eyes as she was recovering from a condition known as ice blindness.
Other witnesses have publicly corroborated some of Willenbring’s account and, in two cases, reported similar experiences during field research with Marchant.
Boston investigators concluded that Marchant engaged in sexual harassment in violation of the university’s policies on sexual harassment and equal opportunity. Specifically, investigators found, “by a preponderance of the evidence, that Marchant directed derogatory sex-based slurs and sexual comments at Willenbring during the 1999-2000 field expedition to Antarctica,” Morrison said. Investigators did not find credible evidence to support Willenbring’s remaining allegations of “direct physical attacks and other types of psychological and physical abuse,” however, she said.
Over all, Boston found the sexual harassment “was sufficiently severe and pervasive so as to create a hostile learning and living environment for Willenbring” in Antarctica.
“We take all complaints of sexual harassment very seriously and will always be vigilant in conducting a thorough, fair and effective investigation,” Morrison said. “We are committed to creating an environment for all members of the university community that is free from sexual harassment.”
Marchant, who has not commented publicly on the case and did not respond to a request from Inside Higher Ed about the university’s findings, has been notified of his right to appeal. Science reported that he denied the allegations against him during the university's investigation.
Willenbring has said that she waited until she gained tenure to report Marchant, for fear of possible professional retribution. Hers is among a group of recent harassment claims against professors involving older incidents -- some inspired by the allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and others not. Boston’s response is significant in that it signals professors will still be held accountable for misconduct, regardless of timeline. The case also highlights the particular challenges faced by those who experience harassment or assault at scientific field sites, which are often geographically remote and lack clear standards of conduct and reporting procedures.
Willenbring said Saturday that she was “pleased that the truth of many women’s experiences was heard and believed.” Even though the university didn’t find credible evidence of physical misconduct, she added, it’s “clear from the report that he still discriminates based on gender and sexually harasses some women.”
Boston’s investigation under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, prohibiting gender discrimination in education, indicates Boston’s “future commitment to students’ well-being,” she said. “Common sense prevailed in their determination that he sexually harassed me.”

        A practice room in the Boston University School of Music. A second Boston University student anonymously revealed to The Daily Free Press evidence of inappropriate messaging on a dating app from College of Fine Arts professor Eric Ruske. SHANNON DAMIANO/ DAILY FREE PRESS STAFF
A current student at Boston University who asked to remain anonymous said College of Fine Arts professor of music and horn performance Eric Ruske engaged in a conversation with them on the dating app Tinder in early May.
The student said they found Ruske on the app in May after raising their preferred age range to above 50 as a joke, similar to another student who interacted with the professor on the dating app Bumble.
Screenshots obtained by The Daily Free Press show Ruske’s and the student’s verified Tinder profiles, as well as their conversation within the app dated May 5.
In contrast to the previous instance, Ruske’s Tinder profile does not identify himself as a BU professor — only several photos, his first name, his age listed as 58, physical distance from the student and sexual orientation. The student’s profile displays they are 19 and that they’re at BU. 
The student said they were not initially aware Ruske was a CFA professor, but figured it out after conducting a Google search. 
The student said the fact that Ruske is pursuing 19-year-old students who attend the University he works at is “highly inappropriate.”
“He’s teaching undergraduate students and he knowingly messaged me with Boston University being in my bio,” they said, “so it wasn’t like it was a big secret that I’m an undergraduate at BU.”
Ruske did not respond to request for comment. BU spokesperson Colin Riley declined to comment.
Screenshots of the conversation show Ruske wrote he does not do pick-up lines in response to the student’s bio, which asks for good pick up lines.
“We boys just aren’t terribly f—— creative, are we?” his message reads with a grinning face with smiling eyes emoji, according to the screenshot. “Too easily distracted by shiny things…and big boobs.”
CFA students shared mixed opinions on the professor. Some said Ruske has never made them uncomfortable, while others noted the interactions form a concerning pattern.
Jessica Young, a CFA doctoral student studying French horn, said Ruske has never made inappropriate comments or made her feel uncomfortable in the five years she has been his student.
“He’s one of the only people I’ve ever studied with, and I’ve taken many trial lessons, who has never discredited the fact that I was a woman,” Young said. “I came here because he has the same high standards for every single person in the studio, and that’s what keeps us getting better.”
Young added many horn students choose BU because they have studied with one of Ruske’s past students. 
She said she was present at the University during part of the sexual misconduct trial between Ruske and his former students, adding that while reports and articles about the trial gave her some pause, her experience with him has been largely positive.
“It was just annoying to see people just deciding to attack him for never seeing him, never meeting him, never standing in the same room with him,” Young said. “It seems so simple in these articles that this guy is a bad guy and he’s only here to f— all the women, but honestly he’s there to teach us how to be better horn players.” 
Young said she believes Ruske’s interactions with the BU student on Bumble were consensual, given “it is a dating app.”
“It’s just frustrating that one thing that has potentially nothing to do with even a CFA student … is bringing him back into potentially getting fired,” she said. “There is no part of me that can go to this school without him.”
Reyna Flores, a senior in CFA and the College of Arts and Sciences, called Ruske’s interactions with students through dating apps “extemely concerning” and said she found them to constitute sexual harassment.
“If he’s your professor, it’s extremely unprofessional and so inappropriate to be pursuing your students at the school that you work at,” Flores said.
As a violin performance major in the School of Music, Flores said she doesn’t see much of Ruske save in hallways and streets, but said one of her closest friends, a French horn major and student of Ruske, has shared her experiences. 
“She describes them in a casual way and brushing them off, but to me it’s pretty alarming to hear,” Flores said. “I remember being really shocked when my friend told me that he made some crude gestures toward her and insinuated that she had large boobs.”
CAS senior Ilana Balog said having taken a class with Ruske her freshman year, Ruske never made her uncomfortable, and that she generally does not hold a bad opinion of him.
“I think that these [incidents] are definitely something that needs to be taken in consideration with regard to my opinion of him,” she said, “but I wouldn’t say he was overly making everybody uncomfortable.”
During that studio horn class she took freshman year, Balog said, Ruske had a “very intense” energy in the classroom and would often speak with “no filter,” making some students a bit uncomfortable.
She said she thinks the University has taken little disciplinary action toward Ruske because of his skill as a musician and professor.
“I think that the school is overlooking everything because they feel like he’s so valuable,” Balog said, “because he’s so talented and such a good professor and produces really good students.”
CFA Dean Harvey Young and Associate Dean Ruthie Jean did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Flores said she hopes disciplinary action is taken toward Ruske, adding the current situation is not “something you can just brush under the rug.” 
“Especially for my colleagues, I hope that something happens,” Flores said. “I hope that it’s not just a slap on the wrist, and I definitely hope that he’s punished for his actions because it makes it a toxic learning environment.”

https://www.eastidahonews.com/2017/07/woman-suing-byu-idaho-widow-alleged-sexual-assault-now-deceased-professor/," REXBURG — A former Brigham Young University-Idaho student claims she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a now-deceased professor between 2014 and 2016.  The female student, whom EastIdahoNews.com has chosen not to identify, filed a Title IX lawsuit against BYU-Idaho in federal court. Title IX bars sexual discrimination on campus and ensures that every university and college receiving money from the federal government investigates and resolves complaints of sexual violence. In the 27-page lawsuit, the woman, who is disabled, alleges that Stephen Stokes, a sociology professor, intentionally targeted her as a “vulnerable person whom he could groom for a sexual relationship.” Stokes is accused of using “his knowledge of (the woman’s) disabilities to coerce (her) into an unwelcomed and unwanted sexual relationship.” The lawsuit asserts at least five school officials were aware of the abuse, but it was not reported to the Title IX coordinator for investigation.  The university and Stokes’ wife, Susan, are listed as defendants in the case. They adamantly deny the allegations.  Both sides are demanding a jury trial to state their arguments.  This case was filed amidst changes to the Title IX policies at BYU-Idaho and other educational facilities owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The changes aims to “encourage the reporting of sexual misconduct” by giving victims or witnesses of sexual assault guarantees of confidentiality, amnesty and leniency.    Stephen Stokes was never accused or charged of any sex crime in Idaho during his life. He died in July 2016 due to complications from heart surgery. Stokes was a “beloved professor” who was missed by faculty and students, according to the BYU-Idaho Scroll. The lawsuit was filed five months after his death and amended in March. THE ALLEGATIONS In the complaint, the woman is described as being disabled due to a number of mental illnesses, including post traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, severe anxiety, panic disorder, anorexia and Stockholm syndrome. Her disabilities allowed her to obtain disability accommodations from the school. Court records indicate the woman met Stokes in 2014 at BYU-Idaho. The two developed a friendship after she discovered Stokes had known her deceased father.  Stokes is said to have encouraged her to join the social work program and promised he would become her faculty advisor. Stokes allegedly took a heightened interest in her and when she joined the program, she told him about her mental issues.   The woman also confided to Stokes that she was experiencing financial problems as a single mother. Stokes arranged for her to get food from the food bank and advocated on her behalf at BYU-Idaho.  The woman asserts her contact with Stokes became more frequent and he confessed to her that he was experiencing marital problems.  He is said to have mentioned that God brought the two of them together. “Stokes told her that Heavenly Father placed her in his life for a reason and that (Stokes was) supposed to show her what it feels like to be cared for … and that God had revealed her goodness to him and that he had been given the sacred privilege to help her,” court documents state.  The woman claims the relationship escalated to hugging in his office and then to physical massage or “spinal touch” sessions to help her relieve severe anxiety. In court documents, she alleges the touching made her anxiousness worse.   In the fall of 2014, court documents state one of the spinal touch sessions ended with sexual activity. Afterward she said it became a regular part of their interaction, and Stokes used God and religion on multiple occasions to justify sexual advances.  In January 2015, the woman took a job as his teaching assistant and she claims Stokes indicated he wanted a more permanent relationship.  “During her employment, (Stokes) continued to insist on providing ‘therapeutic’ rubbing and touching to ‘assist’ (her) in managing her anxiety,” court documents show. “To the contrary, her anxiety became unmanageable at this time.” She saw doctors 14 times between January 2015 and July 2016 to get medication for anxiety or panic attacks exacerbated “by Stokes’ aggressive harassment, stalking and sexual assault and battery,” according to court documents.  Between April 2015 to July 2016, she says, that sexual contact occurred at least three times per week in BYU-Idaho parking lots, classrooms, a campus greenhouse and at her home.  She began to skip school to avoid Stokes, but she said he would show up at her house, at church and at family events. He is said to have told her that “he was her loving husband sent by God.” “(She) wanted to end this harmful relationship, but felt trapped. Stokes had been so kind to (her) as a father figure when they first met, but she wanted nothing to do with his sexual advances and obsession with her as his ‘wife,'” documents show. “She came to believe if she ended the relationship Stokes would retaliate against her and ensure she could not complete her degree.” The woman told a friend and fellow social work student about the relationship. The friend advised that she report Stokes to university officials. The friend also told a school counselor at the BYU-Idaho Counseling Center about the relationship and said she was going to report Stokes.  The plaintiff claims Stokes found out about the friend. He threatened to cancel the friend’s internship if she “continued to meddle in their relationship,” the plaintiff said. Stokes came up with a plan to tell administrators about the relationship, “but to explain their relationship in a way that would not point to any misconduct on Stokes’ part,” the plaintiff said. The woman and the friend spoke with department administrators, according to court documents. The woman initially disclosed that she was in a relationship with Stokes that involved “kissing and leg rubbing,” but was not sexual. She is said to have also told administrators that Stokes had “taken over her life.”  Department leaders met with Stokes to discuss the allegations. “After a matter of minutes Stokes exited the room smiling triumphantly and reported to (the woman) that everything was fine and thanked her for ‘saving him,'” court documents state.  The next day Stokes received a letter of reprimand from the department chair for having an inappropriate relationship with a student and he was advised to stop to avoid further disciplinary action, according to the lawsuit. No other action was taken.  The woman claims even after the reprimand, Stokes “continued to regularly sexually assault and batter (her) on the BYU-Idaho campus and in her home.” Stokes is said to have called and texted the woman up to the time he died on July 1, 2016.    Later, the woman was put on academic suspension for poor grades. She said it was due to missed classes from trying to avoid Stokes and from anxiety that came with the relationship.  She also said due to the lawsuit, she was denied an ecclesiastical endorsement, which is needed to attend BYU-Idaho. Stephen Stokes | BYU-Idaho Scroll  BACKGROUND This federal lawsuit against BYU-Idaho is not the first legal action taken by the female plaintiff against the Stokes estate. In October 2016, the woman filed a claim in Madison County against the estate of Stephen Stokes in excess of $1 million. She was claiming damages for sexual assault, sexual battery, and infliction of negligent and intentional emotional stress. Her attorney said that the case is still active and is pending the results of the federal case.  CLAIM FOR DAMAGES The woman is being represented by Holden, Kidwell Hahn  Crapo in Idaho Falls. When asked about their client, the law firm issued the following statement:  “In spite of the tragic events (the plaintiff) endured from a trusted professor, she is, and intends to remain, a faithful member of the Mormon church. Unfortunately, (her) disabilities make her extremely vulnerable to manipulation and abuse, which she was not prepared to encounter on the campus of BYU-Idaho.”  The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages from BYU-Idaho and the Stokes estate on seven counts:   That BYU-Idaho was a hostile work environment where the plaintiff was sexually harassed and that although the harassment was reported to administrators, no one took corrective measures on her behalf or reported the conduct to the Title IX coordinator as per BYU-Idaho’s Sexual Misconduct Policy. The plaintiff was subjected to teacher-on-student sexual harassment based on the fact Stokes had the power to harm the plaintiff’s ability to complete her education. Also that BYU-Idaho acted with indifference to the abuse and discrimination and as a result the woman continues to suffer emotional distress and humiliation. That the school violated the Americans with Disabilities Act because Stokes knew about her disabilities and proceeded to take advantage of her with unwanted sexual advances. That BYU-Idaho violated the Human Rights Act because Stokes, her superior when she was his teaching assistant, discriminated against her based on gender. The plaintiff claims that Susan Stokes, a representative of her husband’s estate, is liable for the intentional infliction of emotional distress and for Stephen Stokes’ treatment of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims Susan Stokes is also liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress because Stephen Stokes was aware he was in breach of a standard of conduct.  That Stephen Stokes did sexually assault and batter the woman despite her repeated protests and that he used her vulnerabilities to force her into a sexual relationship.  BYU-IDAHO’S RESPONSE With few exceptions, BYU-Idaho and Susan Stokes adamantly deny the allegations made against them by the plaintiff. They imply her story of a sexual relationship with Stokes was made up only after his death.  BYU-Idaho spokesman Brett Crandall issued the following statement about the case: “Brigham Young University-Idaho is committed to promoting and maintaining a safe and respectful environment for the campus community. It is the university’s policy to take immediate and appropriate steps to stop sexual harassment, prevent any recurrence and address its effects. BYU-Idaho confirms it has reviewed allegations of sexual harassment concerning a former employee who passed away in July 2016. The university was unaware of these allegations prior to the employee’s death and is confident it has acted appropriately. Moreover, the university is not aware of any violations of state or federal law. In its court submissions, BYU-Idaho has responded to the lawsuit’s specific allegations and is confident the legal system will determine the truth of this case and will act accordingly.” BYU-Idaho and Susan Stokes are being represented by Boise law firm Andersen, Schwartzman, Woodard and Brailsford. In its rebuttal to the lawsuit, the university denies discriminating against the plaintiff. BYU-Idaho also says administrators had no knowledge of any harassment or abuse.  “When plaintiff met with BYU-I before Stokes’ death, she did not reveal a physical or romantic relationship. Contrary to (her complaint), she did not mention any harassment or abuse,” according to a university statement in court records. Instead, BYU-Idaho claims Stokes’ interactions with the plaintiff were limited to emotional and financial support. “It was not until after Stokes’ death that plaintiff indicated she had a consensual romantic relationship with Stokes. Then months after Stokes’ death and after hiring an attorney and demanding significant sums of money, plaintiff changed her story to claim harassment and abuse,” the statement reads.   The university admits Stokes did help the plaintiff pay for groceries, medication and helped her in a legal matter. But it denies the woman ever told any administrator that there was a physical or romantic relationship with Stokes. BYU-Idaho also asserts the plaintiff’s friend denied knowing anything about a physical relationship between her and Stokes.  EastIdahoNews.com reached out to the friend for comment but has not received a response.  The university said it sent a letter to Stokes directing him to cease all non-academic interactions with the plaintiff. However, nothing reported to BYU-Idaho at the time required a Title IX investigation because all involved said there had been no discrimination or harassment, according to the university.  BYU-Idaho said the plaintiff told several individuals about a consensual romantic relationship after Stokes’ death. Upon hearing those rumors, the Title IX coordinator reached out to the plaintiff multiple times, but she did not meet with him.  BYU-Idaho claims it exercised reasonable care to protect the plaintiff and that it did not know about Stokes’ alleged conduct. The university denies it discriminated against her based on her gender or disability or that she suffered any damages as a result of its actions. The lawsuit is currently in the discovery phase. No trial date has been set.  "
http://nypost.com/2007/02/07/pervy-prof-is-busted/,"
							 A hands-on biology professor has been busted for giving personal anatomy lessons to two female students, police sources said yesterday. 
  Sikdar Masood, 49, fondled the women while teaching at Brooklyn College and the Franklin Career Institute, a Brooklyn trade school, the sources said. 
  “He grabbed my left breast with his right hand. I didn’t know what to do. I left the class crying,” the Franklin Institute victim told The Post. 
  The Brooklyn College victim said, “He was very practiced and slick.” 
  Police sources said the frisky-fingered prof was demonstrating anatomy by pointing to parts of the body of a 25-year-old female student. 
  When the class ended, he told the student to go into the office, where – to her shock – he began fondling her breasts, the sources said. 
  Then he touched her waist and buttocks and told her, “You are so pretty. You don’t have to worry about [passing] this class.” 
  A friend encouraged the young woman to call cops and Masood was busted that night on sexual-abuse and harassment charges. 
  “I’m sure a lot of girls have given him leeway for an easy ‘A,’ ” his victim said. “I don’t think he should be teaching at any college. He should definitely go to jail.” 
  The Post is withholding the victims’ names due to the nature of the alleged crimes. 
  Masood’s wife, Laila, 35, rejected the charges, saying the two women were trying to harass her husband for being too tough a teacher. 
  “I know my husband. He’s strict, but he’s honest,” she said at their Jamaica home. 
  Masood, who trained as a doctor in his native Bangladesh, was fired from Brooklyn College and no longer works at the Franklin Career Institute. 
  The latest incident occurred after a Brooklyn College anatomy class on Sept. 25. 
  Masood was fired on Oct. 11 after an internal investigation, a college spokesman said. 
  The Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office subsequently ran a background check and found a letter from a former student in Masood’s Franklin Career Institute file. 
  The student, also a 25-year-old woman, claimed that on Nov. 1, 2005, after a class on taking a patient’s blood, the pervy prof had students fill out some papers. 
  When the woman handed hers in, Masood squeezed her breast and whispered, “Good job,” the sources said.

http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/social-affairs/20170606/cabrillo-professor-sued-for-sexual-assault-college-sued-for-title-ix-violations,"APTOS  A former student and teacher’s aide has filed a lawsuit against Cabrillo College and a member of its faculty, alleging the professor repeatedly sexually harassed her and committed sexual assault and sexual battery in May 2016.
The professor, Alex Taurke, has taught math at Cabrillo College since 1994. During that time, Taurke only received one training session related to sexual harassment awareness and prevention, according to the May 18, 2017 complaint
At the time of the alleged incidents, the student was an undergraduate math major and enrolled in Taurke’s calculus class. Under the professor’s guidance, she worked as a tutor in the Math Learning Center, eventually becoming his aide.
The complaint alleges Taurke sexually harassed the student throughout the spring semester, including closing blinds to “ensure privacy” during office meetings; moving his chair close to the student’s chair; placing his knees around hers so their knees and thighs would touch; and caressing and stroking the side of the student’s face, head and legs.
Many of the student’s colleagues and friends witnessed the interactions, causing further humiliation, according to the complaint.
When the student filed a grievance with Cabrillo College, she found the proper reporting procedure unclear and the necessary documents inaccessible to students, the complaint reads.				
In addition, the complaint alleges that Cabrillo College has never complied with its Title IX obligations nor employed a permanent and designated Title IX coordinator.
By failing to provide sufficient sexual harassment faculty and staff training management, Cabrillo College failed to protect the student, according to the complaint.				
After being unable to contact the Title IX coordinator at Cabrillo College, the student was directed to a male athletic coach with whom the student felt uncomfortable speaking. As a result, the student submitted a grievance against Cabrillo College with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights on May 25, 2016. 
In the course of the ensuing investigation, the Office for Civil Rights determined that Cabrillo College “did not and never had” a permanent and designated Title IX coordinator. 
During the interview, Taurke admitted to the Office for Civil Rights that he had made the statements to the student and realized the statements constituted sexual harassment, according to the complaint.
In addition, Cabrillo College officials admitted to inadequacies in its Title IX policy obligations as well as Title IX notification, reporting, monitoring and training requirements, according to the complaint.
Cabrillo College spokeswoman Kristin Fabos confirmed that the Office for Civil Rights complaint had been filed and investigated. 
A Dec. 21, 2016 resolution agreement posted on the Office for Civil Rights website contains an extensive list of required revisions to Cabrillo College’s Title IX procedures and policies. It includes mandatory staff and student trainings as well as remedies to its reporting process.
Fabos also confirmed that the student had filed the lawsuit.
“It is now a legal matter as well as a personnel matter,” said Fabos.
Although Fabos went on to confirm that Taurke remains employed by Cabrillo College, she said the college would not comment further on the lawsuit at this time. He is also listed as scheduled to teach multiple courses in Fall 2017.
The student is represented by John Kristensen of Kristensen Weisberg LLP, a Los Angeles-based law firm, who won a $1.15 million sexual assault settlement from the University of California Regents in January. That claim centered on allegations that a UC Santa Cruz student was sexually assaulted on June 13, 2015 by one of her professors.
Kristensen is in trial this week and unavailable to comment on the more recent Cabrillo College case, according to a representative of his law firm.
Prior to the start of the Fall 2016 academic semester, the student quit her job with Taurke as a teacher’s aide because the potential of seeing or interacting with Taurke made her feel “anxious, nervous and uneasy.”
"
https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2018/03/06/cabrillo-settles-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-for-350000/,"APTOS  A sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Cabrillo College and one of its instructors ended with the college agreeing to pay a former student $350,000.
Approval of the settlement was announced Monday night by the Cabrillo Governing Board, according to Cabrillo College President Matt Wetstein. 
“This brings to a closure all litigation surrounding a claim of sexual harassment that was filed by a former student,” Wetstein said in a statement to the Sentinel.
The college agreed to pay $115,000 to the former student out of its own coffers, with the remainder of the $350,000 stemming from insurance funds, according to Wetstein. The settlement, Wetstein emphasized, is not an admission of liability. 
A female former student and teachers aide filed the suit in May, alleging the math instructor Alex Taurke repeatedly harassed, sexually assaulted and sexually battered her in May 2016. The woman was enrolled in Taurke’s calculus class and also served as his teacher’s aide during the time of the alleged incidents.
The suit accused Cabrillo of failing to comply with Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. The complaint alleged Cabrillo failed to provide Taurke with adequate sexual harassment training and did not have a clear pathway to report harassment. The former student claimed she repeatedly tried to report the alleged harassment but was so stymied she eventually turned to the federal Office of Civil Rights. That office began its own investigation, which concluded in January 2017 that Cabrillo had violated Title IX with respect to its “notice, policies and procedures” and that the student was subjected to “unwanted touching and comments by a faculty member, which created a hostile environment on the basis of sex.” 				
As a result, Cabrillo agreed to overhaul its harassment policies and procedures to include annual training and clear reporting mechanisms, and has since hired a full-time Title IX coordinator and compliance officer. 
A federal judge granted Cabrillo’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit in September, but gave the student leave to amend the complaint and re-file, which she did on Oct. 20.				
Due to the “nature of the settlement and the personnel issues involved,” Wetstein said he was unable to provide further comment about the cause.
“However, I can say that we have strengthened our processes around Title IX and sexual harassment training and as an institution of higher education we take responsibility for ensuring that our learning and working environments are safe, free of harassment, and open to all who can benefit from educational advancement,” he said.”
Cabrillo spokeswoman Kristin Fabos declined to comment on any internal discipline proceedings and Taurke’s continued role in the college, calling the matter an “ongoing personnel issue.”
The law firm representing the former student, Kristensen Weisberg LLP, won a $1.15 million settlement from UC Santa Cruz in 2017, alleging sexual assault by a UCSC professor who is now terminated.
Attorneys representing the former student did not respond to requests for comment by press time, nor did attorneys representing Taurke or Taurke himself.

	Cal Poly professor accused of looking up professor’s dress
	June 18, 2018  
	
Jason Alan Williams

A Cal Poly psychology professor whose research field includes covert communication allegedly used his phone to look up a female professor’s dress. [KSBY]
The incident occurred on May 2 in a faculty office building, university officials say. Cal Poly police arrested Jason Alan Williams, 52, shortly after the incident.
Last week, San Luis Obispo County prosecutors charged Williams with a misdemeanor count of peeping with a concealed device with intent to arouse. Williams faces up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
Williams is an associate professor in the psychology and child development, according to the Cal Poly website. He has taught at Cal Poly since 2008, according to his resume.
Courses Williams has taught at the university include general psychology, research methods and memory and cognition.
Williams’ research interests include nonverbal and covert communication, including eye movements and the role of emotion in these processes. He is also interested in researching the role of emotion on electronic communication, according to the university website.
University officials say Williams was not teaching at Cal Poly during the spring quarter. Officials have not said whether the university is taking administrative action against the professor.

Cal Poly psychology and child development professor Jason Williams was sentenced to five years of probation and fined $221 for using his cell phone to take photos up a colleague’s skirt in May 2018.



Court documents show officials have the right to search through the defendant’s electronic devices and his residence. He was also served a protective order mandating that he cannot be within 50 yards of Cal Poly lecturer Kendra Williams. Jason and Kendra are not related. 



The defendant pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge, according to court documents.



The sentencing was postponed four times since the complaint against Jason was filed. Kendra gave an impact statement in court Monday morning, saying the current Title IX policies and procedures are “not enough.”




When Kendra returned as a lecturer the following academic year after the incident, she was reportedly told by Cal Poly not to speak about the incident.



During times when she would need to appear in court for multiple days throughout the quarter or when she would feel triggered during lectures about sexual relationships, she said she would have to tell her students it was “a personal matter.”



“[Cal Poly was] using Title IX to limit my speech and save face,” Kendra Williams said during her impact statement.




The licensed marriage and family therapist also addressed President Jeffrey Armstrong in her impact statement about the alleged mishandling of her investigation, which she said limited the charges the San Luis Obispo County District Attorney could bring against the perpetrator.



“Cal Poly is aware of Jason Williams’ plea agreement reached today,” University SPokesperson Matt Lazier wrote in an email to Mustang News. “The university issued a notice of discipline to Mr. Williams on May 8 of this year. He is currently suspended pending outcome of the disciplinary process, and we have no additional details to provide at this time.” 



Lazier declined to answer whether or not Williams is receiving pay while on suspension. He also did not provide any addition information about the disciplinary process when asked. 




According to Transparent California databases, Jason made more than $85,000 in the 2018 academic year. Data for the 2019 academic year is not yet included in the database. 



Kendra said she hopes the defendant loses his position as a tenured Cal Poly professor.



Days before her appearance in court Monday, Kendra said she invited Armstrong to the sentencing via email. Instead, he sent a representative on his behalf.



Kendra said her husband, two children, friends and department staff supported her throughout the course of the Title IX investigation.

The incident reportedly occurred around 10 a.m. May 2, 2018.



Kendra said Jason stood behind her in the department mailroom and initiated small talk with her.



She had her back to him as she checked her mail, when she said she felt something touch the inside of her right leg.



Upon looking down, Kendra said she saw Jason pointing his cell phone up her skirt and taking photos of her body with the flash on.



She said she confronted her colleague after seeing him upskirting her.



“You didn’t expect to have a woman, who you thought of as only an object, turn back into a woman and challenge you,” Kendra said to Jason in court.



She said this incident was not his first attempt, nor was she his only victim. The names of other potential victims that Kendra referred to are unknown.



Kendra said the defendant pretended to tie his shoes at the time of his prior attempt.



After the sexual harassment was reported, Kendra was placed on medical leave and Jason was booked into San Luis Obispo County Jail, according to an article from The Tribune. He was released from custody that same day, according to the article.



Kendra said she experienced symptoms of acute stress disorder for weeks following the incident, including feeling startled when her husband would enter the same room as her or being triggered when she would lecture about topics relating to sexual relationships.



“I did have times where I would have to skip through a couple of slides in a lecture and just take some time to breathe to get back in a position where I could keep teaching,” Kendra said in an interview with Mustang News.



Advocating for survivors of sexual assault and harassment



Kendra said she respects sexual assault survivors who choose not to be outspoken about their experiences, but is sharing her story to incite change and inspire other survivors to come forward.



“By not putting my voice and my story and my face out there, that allows [Jason] to stay more protected instead of protecting me,” Kendra said.



The total number of sexual assaults at Cal Poly jumped by 50 percent between the years 2015 and 2017, according to previous Mustang News coverage.



According to the Rape, Abuse  Incest National Network (RAINN), only 23 percent of sexual assaults are reported to the police.



Mustang News reached out to the current Title IX Coordinator for Cal Poly. She was not available for comment.

The San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office charged former bioresource and agricultural engineering (BRAE) professor Shaun Kelly with a misdemeanor of indecent exposure. The San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office charged former bioresource and agricultural engineering (BRAE) professor Shaun Kelly with a misdemeanor of indecent exposure.

news@mustangdaily.net



The San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office charged former bioresource and agricultural engineering (BRAE) professor Shaun Kelly with a misdemeanor of indecent exposure after witnesses claimed he flashed his genitals in the library this past year.



On May 27, 2012,the University Police Department (UPD) was called to the Robert E. Kennedy Library, UPD Chief George Hughes said.



The officers arrived on the scene and immediately began interviewing potential witnesses and victims, Hughes said. From the information gathered they were able to identify Kelly as a potential suspect, he said.




“We interviewed Mr. Kelly and at that time we didn’t have enough probable cause to make a physical arrest,” he said.



The case was then forwarded from the UPD to the District Attorney’s Office. Once the office reviewed the case, it filed charges on Kelly, Hughes said. The DA was not available for comment.



Cal Poly legal counsel Carlos Cordova wrote in an email to Mustang Daily that UPD informed Kelly he should not return to campus.




Cal Poly immediately investigated the circumstances surrounding the allegation and served Kelly with a Notice of Pending Disciplinary Action-Dismissal on June 14, 2012, Cordova wrote.



“This is the quickest I have seen a discipline served on a faculty member in the 24 years I have worked for CSU,” he wrote.



Kelly’s teaching assignments were covered by other faculty members and the proposed date for his dismissal was Sept. 10, 2012.




However, a collective bargaining agreement provision between CSU and the California Faculty Association prohibited Cal Poly from imposing the disciplinary sanction until the arbitrator heard the case. The hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, but was cancelled when Kelly submitted a letter to Cal Poly stating he was resigning his employment and withdrawing his request for an arbitration hearing.



Kelly further stated that his resignation was not admittance to the disciplinary allegations held against him.



Head Librarian Anna Gold said the alleged incident had no observable effect on the atmosphere of the library, nor are there any concerns regarding the safety of the library. The use continues to climb and since it is busy, it is very safe, Gold said.

LONG BEACH, Calif. --  A college professor suspended for dating students and offering course credit for homosexual and extramarital sex abruptly resigned his teaching post, university officials said Thursday.
Professor Barry Singer, 39, sent a postcard informing Cal State Long Beach officials of his resignation last Friday, two days after he was suspended for 30 days without pay.

University spokesman Dr. Robert Breunig said officials received the written notice Wednesday, followed by a letter of confirmation, and immediately accepted the resignation.
'He did not indicate at all why he resigned,' Breunig said.
Singer, a tenured psychology professor, came under fire from Christian groups and university officials last month after it was reported that he offered credit in his 'Psychology of Sex' course for homosexual, group and extramarital sex.
Chancellor Glenn Dumke, head of the 19-campus Cal State system, recommended last Wednesday that Singer be suspended for his 'reprehensible' behavior after the professor disclosed he had dated several students.
Singer, who could not be reached for comment, said last week he was surprised by the public outcry over his teaching methods and said he had received several death threats.
'I've pretty much sunk to the basement level,' he said. 'I've got 40 million people out there who are ready to kill me. Some of my colleagues are put out with me, and campus administrators are upset too.'

After his course came under scrutiny by a faculty review committee, Singer agreed to drop credit for the sexual activities, but still gave credit for field trips to gay bars, dressing in drag and visiting nudist colonies.
'It can be a very powerful growth and learning experience,' Singer said of the homework assignments. 'The idea is not to go out and do some kinky things just to see what they're like, but to see change in your behavior and your feelings.'
In a series of subsequent interviews, Singer revealed that he attended risque student parties where nudity and sex occurred and had been 'romantically involved' with several students.
He also released a letter he wrote two years ago outlining the benefits of intimate relations with students, noting it gave the professor experience that could improve his teaching.
Breunig said Singer made an appointment to meet this week with the vice president for academic affairs, but failed to show for the meeting.
He said the university had received about 60 letters and telephone calls from people describing themselves as taxpayers and citizens who were outraged by Singer's teaching methods.
The 'Psychology of Sex' class, which Singer taught for 8 years, will be offered next year under stricter guidelines, Breunig said.

'Dr. Glendon Drake, vice president for academic affairs, has directed the Department of Psychology to establish guidelines for this course, consistent with those established by the American Psychological Association's ethical principals for psychologists,' Breunig said.
Singer, who earned between $30,276 and $36,540 as a tenured professor, will be eligible for retirement benefits.

							     [Civ. No. 23481. Court of Appeals of California, Third Appellate District.  April 16, 1985.]  ORIE ALFRED BROWN, Plaintiff and Appellant, v. STATE PERSONNEL BOARD, Defendant and Respondent; TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGES, Real Party in Interest and Respondent.  (Opinion by Blease, J., with Puglia, P. J., and Carr, J., concurring.) [166 Cal. App. 3d 1152]  COUNSEL  Colley, Lindsey  Colley and Nathaniel S. Colley, Sr., for Plaintiff and Appellant.  No appearance for Defendant and Respondent.  John K. Van de Kamp, Attorney General, N. Eugene Hill, Assistant Attorney General, Charles C. Kobayashi, and Susan P. Underwood, Deputy Attorneys General, for Real Party in Interest and Respondent.  OPINION  BLEASE, J.  Four years after discovery of allegations that associate professor Orie Brown made amorous overtures to two adult female students, [166 Cal. App. 3d 1155] officials of California State University at Sacramento (CSUS) filed charges of misconduct. They charged these acts (and three others), as ""a series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students,"" were cause for dismissal and Brown was fired. The two remote acts and one other occurring in 1979 were upheld as justifying dismissal by the State Personnel Board (board). Brown appeals from a judgment denying him relief by way of a writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5). We conclude that the extreme delay in filing these charges precludes their use as grounds of discipline and that the remaining ground of discipline is insufficient to sustain the charge made. We will reverse the judgment and direct Brown's reinstatement.  Facts  The basis for the dismissal is unprofessional conduct and failure to perform the duties of his office, charged as ""a series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students."" The events sustaining the cause were alleged to be five in number, three of which it was alleged were accompanied by threats of retaliation or retaliation. CSUS admits that it ""does not now, and never has had any rule, regulation, law or policy against faculty and students dating each other, or even living together or marrying one another."" Thus, the claim of misconduct is not premised on the fact of the sexual overtures alone. Rather, it is the extensiveness of the conduct which impairs the teacher student relationship by threats of retaliation which is viewed by CSUS as rendering the matter actionable.  Brown was charged in 1981 with five instances of sexual harassment of his female students, in violation of Education Code section 89535, subdivisions (a), (b) and (f). The board found that allegations of two of the instances were baseless. Allegations that Brown had linked his conduct with retaliation or threats of retaliation were found not to be true. Of the remaining charges two of the instances were in 1975 and the remaining instance in 1979. The board did find that these three charges had merit, albeit in two cases only partial merit. This was found to be cause for dismissal as both unprofessional conduct and a failure to carry out the duties of his position. (Respectively subds. (b) and (f) of Ed. Code, § 89535.)  fn. 1  At the outset of the board hearing Brown argued that two of the three incidents which form the basis of his dismissal should not be considered because the events in 1975 are too remote to serve as grounds of discipline. The board hearing officer rejected the contention that delay in prosecution of the charges could bar their use as a basis of dismissal. He said that if the [166 Cal. App. 3d 1156] evidence showed inability to defend as a result of the delay he would consider the claim. In his proposed decision the hearing officer reiterated the conclusion that no statute of limitation was applicable to failure to prosecute a misconduct claim against a CSUS employee. The hearing officer found the passage of time had prejudiced Brown with respect to defense of the two charges found not sustained but that there was no such prejudice regarding the 1975 incidents. A general description of the charges found substantiated by the board will suffice to set the analytical stage.  Brown taught courses in criminal law at CSUS in the spring of 1975. One of Brown's female students, Ms. H., accompanied him to his office after they had been drinking beer in the school cafeteria. Brown made a pass at her, embracing her and attempting to kiss her. She rejected his advances. Another female student, Ms. N., was discussing an extra credit paper with Brown in his office when he made comments on her attractive physical appearance. He made a pass at her, embracing her and attempting to kiss her. She pushed him away and left his office.  Neither student complained to school authorities concerning these incidents until a year later, in the spring of 1976, when Brown was being considered for promotion and tenure. Then the complaints came to the attention of Professor Melnicoe, the chairman of Brown's department. Melnicoe testified that, although he believed the complaints were relevant to Brown's fitness to teach, they were not mentioned in the promotion and tenure proceedings. He said that the charges were not pursued as disciplinary matters because of the reluctance of the complainants. Melnicoe did bring them to the attention of his administrative superiors but was instructed ""not to go forward [with] anything because the complainants were unwilling to take any action at that time.""  Brown testified that Melnicoe brought up the accusations prior to the award of promotion and tenure. He also testified that the school's rules provided that charges of misconduct were germane to the decision to grant or deny tenure and promotion. He testified that he was summoned before the faculty committee considering his application for tenure and promotion and questioned concerning the charges of Ms. N. and Ms. H. Thereafter, the committee recommended that he receive tenure and be promoted. The CSUS president accepted the recommendation. The board found that the Ms. H. and Ms. N. incidents had been ""discussed by the faculty of the department at a meeting where [Brown's] promotion was being considered.""  The final alleged incident of sexual harassment sustained by the board hearing officer occurred four years later. It concerned Ms. B. She was a [166 Cal. App. 3d 1157] student in two of Brown's courses in the fall of 1979. She had sought Brown out on two occasions to discuss with him personal problems unrelated to her coursework. Later, on October 15, 1979, she went to his office to discuss her difficulties in studying for midterm examinations. While she was there Brown asked when his ""date"" was. Ms. B. said there was no date and noted Brown was a married man and a parent. As she was leaving Brown stated he would ""sure like to make love to [her]."" Ms. B. took this to be a proposition and was offended. She complained to another university professor who took her to Melnicoe.  Melnicoe took no immediate action. In January 1980 Ms. B. filed a title 9 complaint with CSUS. An investigation was commenced by university authorities in March 1980. A protracted review procedure culminated in the issuance of the notice of dismissal in June of 1981. The notice included Ms. B's charges as one of the alleged ""series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students."" The notice is the administrative pleading upon which the dismissal action which we review was predicated.  Discussion  I  Brown challenges the five-year delay in the bringing of charges based upon the 1975 events on grounds it violates the statute of limitations in Government Code section 19635 and, failing that, constitutes laches. Only the latter claim has merit.  Brown implicitly relies upon the statute of limitations applicable to state civil service employees, Government Code section 19635. It provides: ""No punitive action shall be valid against any state employee for any cause for discipline based on any civil service law of this State, unless notice of such punitive action is served within three years after the cause for discipline, upon which such notice is based, first arose. Punitive action based on fraud, embezzlement, or the falsification of records shall be valid, if notice of such action is served within three years after the discovery of such fraud, embezzlement, or falsification."" [1] This section would be dispositive of the 1975 charges if it governed state university disciplinary proceedings. It does not. Although Brown is a state employee, the cause of discipline (Ed. Code, § 89535) is not ""based on any civil service law ...."" fn. 2 [166 Cal. App. 3d 1158]  Brown then suggests that the provisions of Government Code section 19635 have been incorporated into the board's hearing procedures which are made applicable to him by Education Code section 89539. That is not the case. Section 89539 provides that when, as here, a university employee elects to have his case heard before the board, the board ""shall hold a hearing, following the same procedure as in state civil service proceedings ...."" That direction addresses only the civil service hearing procedures before the board. It refers to Government Code section 19578 which requires that the ""hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 11513 of the Government Code ...."" The latter section specifies the evidentiary and other rules for the conduct of the hearing. It does not encompass pleadings, notices and other matters ancillary to the hearing such as matters pertaining to the limitation of actions (Gov. Code, § 19630 et seq.) of which Government Code section 19635 is a part.  Thus, Government Code section 19635 does not directly govern the period within which CSUS must file charges, nor does it do so via Education Code section 89539. These conclusions, however, do not mean that section 19635 has no application to Brown's case.  II  [2] In civil actions laches is a bar to equitable relief. (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Equity § 14, pp. 5239-5240; Stevenson v. Boyd (1908) 153 Cal. 630, 636 [96 P. 284].) It has been made applicable to quasi adjudicative proceedings as a common law policy pursuant to the ""inherent power [of courts] independent of statutory provisions to dismiss an action on motion of the defendant where it is not diligently prosecuted."" (Steen v. City of Los Angeles (1948) 31 Cal. 2d 542, 546 [190 P.2d 937]; cf. Gates v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1979) 94 Cal. App. 3d 921, 924-925 [156 Cal. Rptr. 791]; see generally Cal. Administrative Hearing Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1984) Proceedings Before Hearing, § 2.21.) ""The policy to expedite justice underlying the rule, exists where the proceeding is before a local administrative agency exercising quasi judicial functions such as the board in the instant case. By analogy a proceeding before such a board should be dismissed where an unreasonable time has elapsed--where the proceeding is not diligently prosecuted."" (Steen, supra, at pp. 546-547.) In such cases"" the appointing power is analogous to what in a civil action would be the plaintiff, and the employee the defendant."" (Id, at p. 547.) [166 Cal. App. 3d 1159] Thus the administrative agency must diligently pursue the disciplinary action as if it were seeking equitable relief. In measuring diligence the courts will apply notions of laches borrowed from the civil law.  [3] In civil actions the ""defense of laches requires unreasonable delay plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay."" (Conti v. Board of Civil Service Commissioners (1969) 1 Cal. 3d 351, 359 [82 Cal. Rptr. 337, 461 P.2d 617], fns. omitted.) Ordinarily delay alone does not constitute laches because ""[t]he policy of this state with respect to lapse of time is [separately] embodied in statutes [of limitation] ...."" (McGuire v. Hibernia S.  L. Soc. (1944) 23 Cal. 2d 719, 736 [146 Cal. Rptr. 673, 151 A.L.R. 1062].) For this reason the courts ""have consistently rejected the concept that lapse of time less than the period of limitations in itself constitutes a defense."" (Conti, supra, at p. 359, fn. omitted.) Thus ""[d]elay is not a bar unless it works to the disadvantage or prejudice of other parties."" (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra, Equity, § 15, p. 5240; see also 2 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed. 1941) pp. 177-179.)  It is said that ""[t]here is no fixed rule as to the circumstances that must exist or as to the period of time which must elapse before the doctrine of laches can be appropriately applied."" (Brown v. State Personnel Board (1941) 43 Cal. App. 2d 70, 78 [110 P.2d 497].) That is so because what generally makes delay unreasonable is that it results in prejudice. ""These two factors are interrelated ...."" (In re Marriage of Modnick (1983) 33 Cal. 3d 897, 908 [191 Cal. Rptr. 629, 663 P.2d 187].) ""'It is not so much a question of the lapse of time as it is to determine whether prejudice has resulted. If the delay has caused no material change in statu quo, ante, i.e., no detriment suffered by the party pleading the laches, his plea is in vain.'"" (Conti, supra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 360, quoting from Brown, supra, at p. 79.) Because of the relationship between prejudice and delay the circumstances which give rise to laches vary widely depending upon their interplay in the specific case.  [4] However, there is one circumstance in which unreasonable delay could be found as a matter of law. At the common law, in cases in which equity was not strictly bound by the statute of limitations applicable to actions at law, the courts sometimes adopted for purposes of laches ""a period within which its aid must be sought, similar to that prescribed in analogous cases at law."" (1 Wood on Limitations (4th ed. 1916) p. 276; cf. Holmberg v. Armbrecht (1945) 327 U.S. 392, 396 [90 L. Ed. 743, 747 [66 S. Ct. 582, 162 A.L.R. 719].) In such cases the burden was placed on the plaintiff to show a reasonable excuse for the delay. (Wood, supra, at p. 277, fn. 64.) A similar rule has been adopted in California. In cases in which no statute [166 Cal. App. 3d 1160] of limitations directly applies but there is a statute of limitations governing an analogous action at law, the period may be borrowed as a measure of the outer limit of reasonable delay in determining laches. (SeeIn re Marriage of Modnick, supra, 33 Cal.3d at p. 909;Vai v. Bank of America (1961) 56 Cal. 2d 329, 343 [15 Cal. Rptr. 71, 364 P.2d 247]; Keys v. Marin County (1871) 42 Cal. 252, 256; Ponce v. Graceous Navigation, Inc. (1981) 126 Cal. App. 3d 823, 829 [179 Cal. Rptr. 164]; Scott v. Municipal Court (1974) 40 Cal. App. 3d 995 [115 Cal. Rptr. 620]; Longfellow v. Presidente Miguel Aleman (1974) 36 Cal. App. 3d 508, 514 [111 Cal. Rptr. 643]; Protopappas v. Protopappas (1963) 213 Cal. App. 2d 659, 665 [28 Cal. Rptr. 884]; Curbelo v. Matson Navigation Co. (1961) 194 Cal. App. 2d 305, 308 [14 Cal. Rptr. 913]; compare Zastrow v. Zastrow (1976) 61 Cal. App. 3d 710, 714-715 [132 Cal. Rptr. 536]; see also Ulakovic v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (1940) 339 Pa. 371 [16 A.2d 41]; 3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1974) § 70.03; cf. Lux v. Haggin (1886) 69 Cal. 255, 269 [10 P. 674]; Civ. Code, § 3511.) Whether or not such a borrowing should occur depends upon the strength of the analogy.  [5] We find a strong analogy in Government Code section 19635. As related, it does not govern this case as a statute of limitations. However the section does reflect a legislative policy judgment that a delay of three years is inherently unreasonable in the prosecution of a disciplinary action against a broad range of public employees. The vast and undifferentiated gamut of state employees which are covered by this provision includes employees whose positions mirror those of CSUS employees. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, § 18597.) Thus, section 19635 provides a compelling indication of the outer limit of delay which is reasonable in the prosecution of a disciplinary action against an employee of the state university system. We borrow this period and hold that unless excused, a delay in the initiation of disciplinary proceedings for more than three years is unreasonable as a matter of law.  The board offers as contrary a line of case law of which Bold v. Board of Medical Examiners (1933) 133 Cal. App. 23 [23 P.2d 826] is the leading case. It asserts that statutes of limitation in the Code of Civil Procedure should not be borrowed and applied to administrative disciplinary proceedings. (Also see, e.g., Bernd v. Eu (1979) 100 Cal. App. 3d 511 [161 Cal. Rptr. 58]; Rudolph v. Athletic Commission (1960) 177 Cal. App. 2d 1, 22 [1 Cal. Rptr. 898]; cf., e.g., In re Lowenthal (1889) 78 Cal. 428 [21 P. 7].) However, this case law is distinguished by two critical considerations. First, the analogies between the claims covered by the civil statutes of limitations and those at issue in the administrative actions were weak. Second, in none of these cases was there a delay by the public agency against whom laches was asserted. By contrast, the analogy between the kind of cases [166 Cal. App. 3d 1161] covered by Government Code section 19635 and Brown's case provides a precise parallel and it is the agency which has delayed.  That leads us to consider the effect of the unreasonable delay. [6] Statutes of limitation and the doctrine of laches share a common policy. ""'Statutes of limitation, like the equitable doctrine of laches, in their conclusive effects are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.'"" (Wood v. Elling Corp. (1977) 20 Cal. 3d 353, 362 [142 Cal. Rptr. 696, 572 P.2d 755], quoting from Telegraphers v. Ry. Express Agency 1944)321 U.S. 342, 348 [88 L. Ed. 788, 792, 64 S. Ct. 582].) The policies also encompass other forms of injury such as those resulting from a change of position during a delay. A statute of limitations effectuates these policies by a fixed rule which, absent tolling, bars the proceeding without proof of prejudice. Laches, on the other hand, requires proof of a delay which results in prejudice or change of position.  However, as applied to laches the ""effect of the violation of [the analogous] statute is to shift the burden to the plaintiff to prove that his delay was excusable and that the defendant was not prejudiced thereby."" (Curbelo, supra, 194 Cal.App.2d at p. 310; see also Ponce, supra, 126 Cal.App.3d at p. 830.) That gives effect to the policies of the statute in the context of laches while removing the rigidity of the statutes of limitation. Conti says that the burden of proof of prejudice ought not to be shifted, at least where the party asserting the defense of laches enjoys better access to the date respecting prejudice. (Conti, supra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 361.) But Conti did not concern the borrowing of an analogous statute of limitations. Rather it operated within a context of a directly governing statute of limitation. In that context, the policy of the statute was effected solely as a statute of limitations. Here, no effect can be given to the policy of the borrowed statute unless it establishes a presumption which shifts the burden of proof. We turn to the issues of excuse and prejudice.  ""In order to excuse delay, [the responsible party] must show exceptional circumstances prevented earlier action."" (Ponce, supra, 126 Cal.App.3d at p. 829, citation omitted.) That might be shown, for example, where the public agency lacks knowledge of the grounds of action. That is not the case here. [7] The only excuse advanced by CSUS is the reluctance of the witnesses to the 1975 events to lodge a formal complaint. This is unpersuasive. If an overt sexual advance to a student while acting as a professor is unprofessional conduct that is so regardless of the subjective response of the student. Whether the student welcomes the advance, declines the [166 Cal. App. 3d 1162] offer, or is deeply affronted, is extraneous. Unprofessional conduct may be a breach of the rights of the particular student or students affected. However, with respect to the dismissal of a professor for cause, the administrative cause of action is not founded upon a private right of a particular student. It is founded on the right and duty of CSUS to deter misconduct with punishment, just as a criminal offense is a matter between the state and the offender, independent of the wishes of the victim of the offense. The disposition of the victim may be of interest in the exercise of discretion to prosecute or not to prosecute. However, when the election is made to forego prosecution the unreasonable delay that attends that election is not excused merely because the authorities have deferred to the wishes of the victim. It is just as unfair to let an employee ""twist slowly in the wind"" regardless of who the employer permits to hold the rope. CSUS attempts to bolster its argument by noting it has a ""practice"" to act only upon written complaint. That is not an excuse. A self-imposed constraint is no more a justification because it is delineated a practice than if it is discretionary. We note that when CSUS made up its mind to act it was able to persuade the formerly reluctant victims to participate.  In sum, we find no cognizable excuse for the delay of four years in initiating the disciplinary action concerning the 1975 events.  [8] That leaves the issue of prejudice. CSUS did attempt to meet this burden. The board said: ""[Brown] made no showing of injury as a result of the delay in the charges, nor could he do so. The only witnesses who testified about each of these incidents were the women involved and appellant. No one else could have testified, since appellant was alone with each woman at the time of the alleged harassment. None of their memories seemed to be dimmed by the passage of time. Thus, there was no injury, and the doctrine of laches does not apply."" The board however did not go far enough. Assuming that we credit its determination of credibility, prejudice may also be established by detrimental reliance by the affected party upon the status quo. (See Vesper v. Forest Lawn Cem. Assn. (1937) 20 Cal. App. 2d 157, 165-166 [67 P.2d 368]; see also e.g., Lux v. Haggin, supra, 69 Cal. at pp. 269-270;Conti v. Board of Civil Service Commissioners, supra, at p. 360 relying upon Brown v. State Personnel Board (1941) 43 Cal. App. 2d 70, 79 [110 P.2d 497]; see also Zakaessian v. Zakaessian (1945) 70 Cal. App. 2d 721, 726-727 [161 P.2d 677].) The record shows such reliance. The tenure committees in 1976 advanced Brown to tenure in the face of the 1975 charges. The board found that the Ms. H. and Ms. N. incidents had been ""discussed by the faculty of the department at a meeting where [Brown's] promotion was being considered."" That is a [166 Cal. App. 3d 1163] circumstance which we must assume, in the absence of contrary proof by CSUS, led Brown to devote his energies to his employment with CSUS and perforce to forgo other employment opportunities. Nothing in the record supports an inference that Brown was without alternative prospects. Professor Melnicoe testified that Brown was a good teacher whose evaluations compared favorably with other faculty members. The loss of four years at the outset of an academic career is a considerable change of position in reliance upon the status quo. That works a sufficient prejudice to transform the unreasonable delay in this case into the bar of laches. Accordingly, the disciplinary action may not be founded upon the 1975 events.  III  [9] That leaves intact the finding of a single sexual advance made in 1979 without threats of academic retaliation and tenders the question whether it alone supports the disciplinary action. We will answer in the negative because it does not support the charges upon which the disciplinary action was taken and they cannot be amended at this late date.  The notice of dismissal, the charging document filed by CSUS, alleged a linked set of events as the singular ground constituting the cause for discipline. It charged that ""[t]he events upon which the ... causes [e.g. unprofessional conduct] are based are a series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students by you, including harassment of: [Ms. N., H. and B. accompanied by threats or retaliation]."" The finding of a single sexual advance to Ms. B., made without threat or retaliation, remaining after elimination of the 1975 charges from consideration, does not support that charge. Manifestly a single instance does not constitute a series or a pattern. Nor was the act accompanied by retaliation as charged. That bears upon the question whether the advance impinged upon Brown's professional duties. We again note that CSUS admits that it ""does not now, and never has had any rule, regulation, law or policy against faculty and students dating each other, or even living together or marrying one another."" Accordingly, there is not substantial evidence to support the charge made. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5; cf. Wheeler v. State Bd. of Forestry (1983) 144 Cal. App. 3d 522, 528 [192 Cal. Rptr. 693].) That conclusion compels Brown's reinstatement. fn. 3 [166 Cal. App. 3d 1164]  [10] The discipline of an employee of the California State University and Colleges must be predicated upon a ""statement of causes [and] the events or transactions upon which the causes are based ...."" (Ed. Code, § 89538.) The causes for discipline are set forth in Education Code section 89535 and include unprofessional conduct. The university initiates the disciplinary proceedings by giving a notice (the charging document) to the employee alleging the causes and events upon which discipline is based and takes the disciplinary ""action"" (Ed. Code, §§ 89538, 89539). The action constitutes the university's judgment that the conduct, i.e., the alleged ""events or transactions,"" meets CSUS's criteria of the alleged cause of discipline, e.g., unprofessional conduct, and that the respondent has engaged in it. Neither section 89539 nor any other provision of law fn. 4 permits the amendment of the charging document after CSUS has taken its disciplinary action. fn. 5  Where, as here, the employee elects an appeal to the State Personnel Board, Education Code section 89539 governs both the grounds of appeal and (necessarily) the grounds upon which the board may act, here ""that the employee did not do the acts or omissions alleged as the events or transactions upon which the causes are based ...."" (Italics added.) This provision limits the board's authority to act (Ed. Code, § 89539) to the allegations [166 Cal. App. 3d 1165] of the charging document. Consequently, the board may not alter the charging document or take action upon a charge not made.  The judgment is reversed. The trial court shall issue a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the reinstatement of Brown and according him any other relief to which he may be entitled as a result of said reinstatement.  Puglia, P. J., and Carr, J., concurred.  FN 1. The board impliedly rejected the charge that the conduct was also immoral conduct. (Ed. Code, § 89535, subd. (a).)  FN 2. Employees of the California State University and Colleges are exempt from the constitutionally mandated civil service system. (Cal. Const., art. VII, § 4, subd. (h).) They are state employees. (Slivkoff v. Board of Trustees (1977) 69 Cal. App. 3d 394, 401 [137 Cal. Rptr. 920].) However, they do not come within Government Code section 19635 because it applies only to a ""cause for discipline based on any civil service law of this State ...."" The cause of discipline in this case stems from Education Code section 89535 which is not a civil service law. (See Gov. Code, § 18526.) That the Legislature has accorded the state universities some attributes of civil service protection, e.g., tenure and the right to a State Personnel Board hearing concerning disciplinary action, does not have the effect of conversion of their status to that of civil service employees. (Cal. State Employees Assn. v. Trustees of Cal. State Colleges (1965) 237 Cal. App. 2d 530, 538-539 [47 Cal. Rptr. 73].) Thus Government Code section 19635 cannot be applied directly as a limitation applicable to Brown's dismissal.  FN 3. It might be argued that the appropriate disposition is to remand the case to the board for a reconsideration of the penalty in the light of the remaining finding. That is sometimes appropriate in cases in which there has been a failure to make a finding necessary to support the charge made. (See American Funeral Concepts v. Board of Funeral Directors  Embalmers (1982) 136 Cal. App. 3d 303, 314 [186 Cal. Rptr. 196]; Robinson v. State Personnel Bd. (1979) 97 Cal. App. 3d 994, 1003-1004 [159 Cal. Rptr. 222].) However, nothing in these cases authorizes an amendment of the charging document or requires a respondent to defend against a charge not made.  FN 4. It is noteworthy that the provisions which govern state civil service proceedings, although not applicable here, provide for amendment of the charging document only prior to the submission of the appeal for decision by the board. In such case, ""[i]f the amended ... notice presents new causes or allegations the employee shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense thereto ...."" (See Gov. Code, § 19575.5, italics added.)  FN 5. In the absence of a procedure which permits a respondent to prepare for and contest an amended charge a serious constitutional problem arises. Due process requires that the respondent be given ""notice ... of the standards by which his conduct is to be measured"" (Wheeler v. Board of Forestry, supra, 144 Cal.App.3d at p. 527) and ""fair notice as to the reach of the [disciplinary] procedure."" (In re Ruffalo (1968) 390 U.S. 544, 552 [20 L. Ed. 2d 117, 123, 88 S. Ct. 1222].) That requires that the respondent be given adequate notice both of the claimed legal standard and the events which are alleged to contravene it and an opportunity to challenge them. Where the cause alleged has potential application to a broad range of conduct, such as unprofessional conduct, the events alleged to contravene the charge do more than allege what must be proved. They also provide criteria by which the charge is narrowed. (Cf. Wheeler, supra, 144 Cal.App.3d at pp. 527-528.) Any significant amendment of the events alleged to constitute the cause alters not only what must be proved but may alter the criteria by which the cause is to be measured. Although Brown was put on notice that the events which constitute the remaining finding were in issue their significance as a singular ground of discipline was not charged or communicated to him. That might have entirely altered the cast of Brown's case. We note that the board expressed equivocation about the viability of the 1979 events as a sole ground of discipline. We imply no opinion on that subject.

In it, Shirley Hoogstra, Calvin's vice president for student life, said the student alleged in May this year she had carried out the relationship with biology professor Steve Matheson.""Calvin has strict policies against sexual harassment and this relationship violated Calvin's policies,"" Hoogstra said in the letter. ""These policies recognize there is a power differential between faculty and students. After being confronted by the college with this report, the professor resigned rather than face termination.""The letter goes on to say Calvin administrators launched an ""extensive internal review and investigation,"" which led to the formation of a task force on the matter.The task force was set up to ""educate and protect our community so we can learn together how to prevent and properly address allegations of sexual harassment,"" according to Hoogstra's letter.The task force's formation delayed the news being brought before students because it only recently began meeting, Hoogstra said in the letter.A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon so students could discuss the matter with Student Senate and school officials.FOX-17 first reported Friday's letter had been sent out.Zane McMillin can be reached through email and Twitter."

On her Skepchick blog, Watson slammed Krauss for not acknowledging his obvious bias — and thus violating a core value of skepticism. “Krauss’ statement is extremely disturbing and makes scientists look like ignorant, biased fools who will twist data to suit their own needs,” she wrote.“I remain skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know,” Krauss responded in the post’s comments. “If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”The dust-up was part of a broader discussion among feminist skeptics about what they saw as the misogyny of some of the old guard. In June 2011, Watson posted a YouTube video mentioning her experiences with men in the movement.In the resulting furor, Watson was publicly mocked by Dawkins and received a torrent of online abuse. Over the next couple of years, she posted a sample of the abusive comments she received on her blog.With these issues dividing skeptics, Hensley, by then executive director of CFI’s Washington DC branch, organized a new conference called “Women in Secularism,” which debuted in May of 2012. It was a space to celebrate the history and accomplishments of secular women, Hensley said, “but also to give a platform so that we could talk about the issues and problems we were facing.” In now-deleted comments on CFI’s blog post announcing the event, some skeptics argued that the movement didn’t have a problem with women, and that the event would amount to “man bashing.”On one panel, Jen McCreight, then a biology PhD student, spoke out about the whisper network. Before going to her first big atheist meeting, she said, “unsolicited I got many emails from different individuals basically warning me which male speakers not to interact with as a young woman.”She didn’t name names. But in August of 2013, with accusations swirling about sexual harassment by several other prominent atheists, McCreight pointed the finger at Krauss. On her Blag Hag blog, she described the experiences of two unnamed women. One was Hensley. The other asked BuzzFeed News to refer to her by her first initial, A.A. was an undergraduate who had first met Krauss in 2008 at the annual American Atheists Convention through her work as a student atheist activist. Three years later, when she and other students walked into the bar at the same meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, A. recalled, Krauss pulled over a chair for her and started running his hand up her leg under the table.“I kind of shifted away,” A. said. “He put his hand on again. I crossed my legs. He put his hand on again. And eventually I had to like physically turn my entire body.”A. was shocked, but didn’t want to make a scene, she said. “The last thing I need to do is, you know, yell at Lawrence and then have to deal with any potential fallout.”Krauss denied A.’s account, and said that it was A. who had come on to him, inviting him to join her in the hotel’s hot tub. Robin Elisabeth Cornwell, a friend of Krauss’s and then executive director of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, was also there, and backed his account. A. denied mentioning the hot tub or flirting with Krauss. Benjamin Wurst, one of her student companions, told BuzzFeed News that, as they left the bar, A. told him Krauss had put his hand on her.Some CFI staff, too, were concerned about Krauss’s behavior, and it was a point of contention when the organization’s leaders were considering whether to invite him as a featured speaker on a cruise to the Galápagos Islands. He was by then an honorary member of the organization’s board of directors.“I really don’t want Krauss on this trip,” Patricia Beauchamp, CFI’s business and finance manager, emailed CFI’s then-president, Ronald Lindsay, on March 11, 2013. “His behavior on past trips has been offensive to many and this is a very expensive and small vessel.”She was referring to a 2011 CFI cruise of the Greek Islands. Krauss had reportedly propositioned a woman to join him and a female companion for sex in their cabin. (Both Krauss and his companion on the cruise, now his wife, told BuzzFeed News that the incident did not happen.)Lindsay’s response to Beauchamp’s email focused on the bottom line: “Is it your position that Krauss will keep us from selling cabins? If so, you need to say so expressly, and you also need to give me some evidence. If Krauss is not invited, this will be a major issue, so i need facts, not speculation.”Beauchamp noted the “report of unwanted sexual attention given to one guest.” She concluded, “This is not the kind of person I think should represent us on a cruise.”Beauchamp declined to comment for this story. Lindsay told BuzzFeed News that, after Beauchamp’s email, he discussed the incident with the passenger in question. “I did call the guest and she substantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apologized on behalf of the organization,” Lindsay said by email. He also said he discussed the incident with Krauss, who denied it. Krauss was invited on the cruise.Hensley had by then started talking about the incident in the Washington, DC, hotel room, telling several CFI colleagues, including Lindsay. He said he told her she “probably” could file a complaint.Lindsay no longer leads CFI, which has since merged with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. Dawkins did not respond to requests for comment, and the organization’s current leadership stated that it “follows its policies and procedures regarding complaints of improper behavior, and will continue to do so, to further its goal of ensuring the safety and well-being of attendees, guests, volunteers, and employees at its events.”After Krauss left a comment on McCreight’s blog denying her allegations, she took the post down. “Well, Famous Skeptic is vaguely threatening to sue me,” McCreight wrote the day after her initial post was published. “Since Famous Skeptic is rich and I am poor, and since my two sources are too terrified to openly speak out,” she said, “I have removed the part of my previous post that refers to him so I don’t go bankrupt with legal fees.”McCreight declined to be interviewed for this article. A second blog post published at about the same time by another young skeptic, Ed Cara, which described the allegation about the 2011 cruise, was also quickly taken offline.

NEW BRITAIN–A former professor has been arrested after allegations that he sexually assaulted a student.                    
                    
Daniel Gula, 52, a former CCSU professor, was accused of assaulting a student of in the fall of 2014. He was arrested on Wednesday, September 2, and charged with sexual assault in the third degree, unlawful restraint in the first degree and disorderly conduct.                    
                        
                    
The student made the allegations to the school’s Women Center on September 23, 2014, who then reported it to the chief diversity officer and Title IX officer.                    
                    
The school then interviewed the student, who started CCSU in the fall of 2014.                    
                    
In the interview, the student said she met Daniel Gula, an adjunct professor in the English department, early in the semester. She soon chose him as a mentor, and the two exchanged emails.                    
                    
The interview was outlined in an investigatory report from the school, which Fox CT obtained. In it, the student said that until September 15, the relationship was professional. However, on that day, she stopped by his office to talk, and things changed. She said that as she went to leave, Gula inappropriately touched her and exposed his genitals.                    
                    
The suspect said she believed he was like that with other students, and it seemed like he had planned the interaction.                    
                    
The school began an investigation, which was completed on October 22. In the instigation, it says the student initially did not want to name the professor or pursue charges, but she did want to have a class of hers moved to a different building because it was at the same time the professor was in that building. She also wanted to drop Gula’s English class.                    
                    
Eventually, she dropped both of those classes and was issued a full refund.                    
                    
Six days after her initial report of the incident, on September 29, the student named Gula as the perpetrator in a report to CCSU police. She still didn’t want to pursue charges, or participate in the investigation.                    
                    
When the school investigator tried to interview Gula, he wouldn’t respond. Eventually, he provided a handwritten statement to police admitting to the allegations.                    
                    
The investigation concluded Gula had violated the college’s sexual misconduct, sexual assault and intimate partner violence policy. He was asked to resign, and he did.                    
                                
                    
Gula was only arrested this week because the victim decided to pursue charges after learning he had resigned from the school instead of being fired, meaning he could potentially get another job with another university.                    
                    
Gula’s lawyer released the following statement to Fox CT: “At this point, we are gathering information in terms of what specifically is being alleged to have occurred in order to resolve this matter.”

https://www.wtnh.com/news/former-professor-who-was-sentenced-for-inappropriate-behavior-now-facing-lawsuit/1068779029,"
		
		
NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (WTNH) — A former Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) student has filed a lawsuit against the professor she has alleged sexually assaulted her while attending the college.



In a release sent to News 8, Nina Pirrotti of Garrison Levin‐Epstein Fitzgerald  Pirrotti announced that she has filed a lawsuit on Jan. 31, 2017 on behalf of her client, Shannon Cunningham, against Daniel Gula, formerly a professor at CCSU. The complaint alleges that while Cunningham was a student at CCSU and Daniel Gula was a professor there, he sexually assaulted her in his office. The release states that Cunningham reported his conduct against her to the Woman’s Center at CCSU, the university’s Title IX Officer and the CCSU Police Department. The firm announced that according to CCSU police reports, Gula confessed to the conduct.



Cunningham’s attorneys say that she initially did not wish to pursue a criminal case against Gula but, when she found out that CCSU had permitted him to resign and that he subsequently was able to secure employment as a professor in an all‐women’s college, she sought his arrest and prosecution. On Jan. 31, 2017, Gula entered a plea of nolo contendere after which the court entered a verdict of guilty of the crimes of unlawful restraint in the second-degree, reckless endangerment in the first-degree and Coercion and sentenced Gula to a one‐year suspended jail sentence and two years’ probation.



According to Cunningham’s attorney’s, she has filed this lawsuit because “she is determined to do what she can to hold Daniel Gula fully accountable for his actions, not only for her sake but for the sake of all female students with whom he may interact now or in the future”.

Two Central Connecticut State University theater professors investigated on suspicions of engaging in sexual misconduct with their students have left the university.

Joshua Perlstein, who was hired in 1992 and placed on paid administrative leave in April 2018, abruptly resigned on May 16, shortly before a scheduled termination hearing, a spokeswoman for the college said Wednesday.


Thomas Delventhal, who was hired in 1998 and placed on paid leave in January, was terminated by the university on May 24, but is exercising his right to appeal the action, the spokeswoman said.

Both professors were the subject of an investigation that concluded in January that each had likely engaged in sexual misconduct with one or more students.

Perlstein, whose annual salary was $97,847, had been on paid administrative leave for about 13 months, a spokeswoman said, while Delventhal, who was earning $97,652 annually, was on paid leave for about four months. The spokeswoman said Perlstein has applied for retirement benefits, a process which she said is handled by the state comptroller.


CCSU President Zulma R. Toro, who announced plans to fire both professors in January, expressed frustration at the length of termination proceedings under the collective bargaining agreement.


“It has been a long process, especially for the sexual assault survivors and the Theatre Department students and faculty. The investigation and termination proceedings have been frustrating and challenging, but we are moving forward,” Toro said Wednesday. “We have learned a great deal and made significant changes in personnel, policies, and procedures – with much more to come.”

Toro hired the Hartford law firm, Shipman  Goodwin LLP to investigate last spring after an April 2018 article in CCSU’s student newspaper, The Recorder, revealed allegations of sexual misconduct against Perlstein. The same article also detailed a lack of administrative action when complaints were made.


The investigation, which was completed Jan. 10 and entailed reviewing thousands of documents and emails, and conducting interviews with dozens of faculty, staff and current and former students, found significant evidence that Perlstein was involved in sexual misconduct with several students, including a lengthy, manipulative relationship with one student that continued after her graduation. The investigation did not provide the names of the students.

It also found that the professor had a “history of questionable interactions” with female students, was untruthful to investigators and attempted to conceal his problematic conduct because he believed it would put his job in jeopardy.


Following up on students’ complaints about Delventhal, the investigators said that he admitted to over the years kissing five students on the neck and/or forehead, was untruthful during his investigatory interview, and denied attempting to engage in any relationship with current or former students.


Perlstein said Wednesday in an emailed statement, “I want to apologize deeply and genuinely for the harm I have caused to the women who shared their stories; to my students and the faculty and staff of CCSU; and most of all to my friends and family.” His full statement is below.

Delventhal could not be reached for comment.

Students relieved — and frustrated

Kileen Nadeau, left, and Anna Kelly have said they were the victims of  unwanted advances from CCSU Professor Joshua Perlstein when they were students at the university.

Several of the students who were interviewed by investigators and whose stories were told without names in the report have come forward in the past year to discuss their cases with reporters.  On Wednesday they expressed relief that the professors are not employed at the university any longer along with some frustration that Perlstein had not been fired.


Ashley Malloy, who says she is the student who had the long relationship with Perlstein — which lasted  off and on through the last 18 months of her college career and beyond — said, “Ultimately I think it’s great that [Perlstein] is not entrusted with the education of young people anymore, specifically young women, but this is not the ending I would have liked to have seen.”

Malloy said she would have liked to have seen Perlstein fired. The lack of that “punitive action” from the university toward him “is deeply upsetting,” she said.

Malloy said she was coerced into a relationship with Perlstein in 2013 when he was the advisor for her senior thesis and that she feared if she broke off her relationship with him, her academic career would be derailed. The investigation details emails between her and Perlstein, she said, which document the manipulative relationship in which she felt trapped.


“How do you say no to someone who has the power to alter your grades and affect the course of your future as an actor?” Malloy asked Wednesday. “You are trying to live out your dream and this person is carving out the path for you and you feel like if you deviate from what he wants, it could cost you something.”

Anna Kelly, another former CCSU student whose report of Perlstein’s sexual misconduct toward her was covered in the investigation, said “a big part of me is disappointed” that Perlstein was able to resign, rather than being fired.

She said, however, that she has been pleased with Toro’s response to the revelations. “I felt heard and I felt listened to,” Kelly said. And she has been happy about the speed with which Toro has made changes on campus.

In January, when the investigation was complete, Toro announced plans to reorganize the university’s human resources department after evidence showed that administrators for years failed to take proper action on complaints of sexual misconduct. The university president said at the time she was “disgusted and disheartened” by the findings that the two professors had “repeatedly engaged in sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior with their students.”

“Also disturbing are the apparent failures by administrators who, over the years, did not protect our students,” Toro went on. “The findings pinpoint vital changes that are needed to ensure past misbehaviors, mistakes and inaction are not repeated at this university.”


Toro said she planned to appoint new leadership to the Office of Diversity and Equity, and on Wednesday a spokeswoman sent a statement saying that Nancy “Rusty” Barcelo, who most recently worked as a diversity consultant with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will join CCSU in July to lead the Office of Diversity and Equity on an interim basis.


In a letter to the CCSU community, Toro also outlined other steps taken to improve the university’s systems, including hiring Sibson Consulting to help reengineer the Offices of Diversity and Equity and Human Resources and hiring two more staff members for the diversity and equity office. The maximum cost of Sibson’s work will be $170,000.

The university is also planning to implement an institution-wide reporting, monitoring,  and tracking system in the late fall to facilitate and maintain the collection of information, including complaints. And it has contracted with a company to design and administer a campus climate survey that will be done in September.

Here is the entire text of Joshua Perlstein’s statement: 


        I want to apologize deeply and genuinely for the harm I have caused to the women who shared their stories; to my students and the faculty and staff of CCSU; and most of all to my friends and family.

        In theatre, character is defined by what someone does under adverse circumstances. My experience at the Freedom Theatre in a refugee camp in Palestine showed me that even under the worst conditions, one can respond creatively and humanely. Bryan Stevenson, in his book JUST MERCY, reminded me that “no person should be judged by their worst act.” In order to insure that, I knew I must act creatively and give my time and energy in service of those in need. During the past 15 months I have trained in Restorative Justice techniques; volunteered in Hospice care; been certified as a Court Appointed Special Advocate through the Department of Children and Families; signed on to do literacy work in prisons; and most recently was accepted into the AmeriCorps program. I have had meaningful discussions with my two daughters about toxic masculinity and other issues affecting relationships in the current time. Finally I have sought the advice of a therapist to look deeply at the roots of my behavior.

            It would have been my preference to sit with those harmed in a mediated setting; to listen deeply to their stories; answer any concerns they have; and begin the process of repair with their needs in mind. In lieu of that I hope that my recent work will satisfy them. And if not I hope they will contact me and let me know what more  I can do.


            I look back on my years at CCSU with cherished memories. I wish the best for all whom I have impacted and all who have impacted me.

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to seek out such material.""My childhood and teen years put some context around what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday, July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City. Merrill, 58, whose CMU research included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not excuse such conduct.“I never harmed a child, but I understand children were abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said.Before Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material.“I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those individuals,” Merrill said.Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that Merrill’s collection depicted  children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90 percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon violence toward children, Dill said.Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU.In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year felony.Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous Merrill apologized to them and to CMU.Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds, said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment.Merrill told Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn.“I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child pornography,"" he said.Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records.A member of the university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff alerted university police of the content.Questioned by police, Merrill said he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have any more such material.Police in November executed a search warrant at Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers. Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487 images of child porn and 26 similar videos.Merrill resigned from his tenured position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor weapons offense.Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case.A federal grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012."

                                OLYMPIA — Central Washington University has fired professor and state Rep. Matt Manweller, R-Ellensburg, following its latest investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior by the lawmaker.In a statement released Tuesday, the university said it wouldn’t make public an investigation report into the allegations until later this month, but that Manweller’s employment had ended.Manweller has blasted the university’s investigation, calling it politically motivated. In a text message Tuesday, Manweller wrote that he intended to file a lawsuit against the university and the investigator.“Over nine months ago the university communicated to me that they were going to terminate my employment regardless of what the investigation revealed,” Manweller wrote. “Today, they made good on that threat.”Manweller could authorize release of the report early. In a text message to The Associated Press, he said he has not yet decided whether to allow the early release of the report, or to seek an injunction to block it.The most recent investigation was completed last month by Trish Murphy of Northwest Workplace Law. While the university didn’t provide details about the investigation, its statement said Manweller “has been afforded all of his due process rights under the faculty collective bargaining agreement, including the right to union representation.”In previous years the university looked into two allegations of sexual harassment made against Manweller. The lawmaker, meanwhile, was the subject of another, separate complaint made last year at the Washington Legislature.#MeTooManweller is one of several current or former Washington legislators who have faced scrutiny in the wake of the #MeToo movement.The university’s action comes as lawmakers and officials in Olympia are grappling with how to strengthen a system to report complaints and hold accountable those found to have behaved inappropriately.In anticipation of the report becoming public, Manweller released a video earlier this month in which he criticized the investigation as politically motivated and accused officials of targeting him over trivial issues.“Let’s be clear: Central is not responding to allegations, they are manufacturing allegations,” Manweller said in the video.He said sexual harassment should be taken seriously but that it’s a disservice to the #MeToo movement if some of the issues raised in the report are considered harassment.“There is nothing in this report to apologize for,” he said. “The things that are true are not inappropriate. And the things that are inappropriate are not true.”Earlier this month, Manweller provided to reporters affidavits from two students, including one who wrote that Murphy “put words in her mouth” and she felt she was “being pressured into saying things that were not true.” Manweller said an additional student is set to sign an affidavit as well. Murphy declined to comment Tuesday, but in its statement, the university wrote that it stands by her “comprehensive investigative report and is confident that the report will withstand public scrutiny.”In its statement, the university said it “deeply regrets that Dr. Manweller has chosen to make public statements minimizing, trivializing, even ridiculing, the female students who have come forward with legitimate concerns.“The University trusts that the investigation report — and the University’s response — will fully address and validate the concerns of our students, and we thank them for their courage in coming forward,” the statement says.Manweller had been at the university since 2003 and worked as a political-science professor. A state lawmaker since 2012, he has been cruising toward re-election this year. He received more than 63 percent of the vote in last week’s primary. He advanced to the November ballot along with Democrat Sylvia Hammond.He also noted the strong support he received in the recent election, calling it “an overwhelming landslide.”“It is never easy to stand up to a bully but I’m glad the voters in the 13th district are supporting my efforts,” he wrote.InvestigationsThe latest investigation of Manweller began after a Seattle Times story in December that detailed two previous investigations conducted at CWU.In one of those, a student had reported that Manweller invited her to a bar in 2006 and propositioned her and a friend to have a threesome, according to records. In another, a student had reported that Manweller had made sexual comments, touched her leg and kissed her in his office.Manweller disputed the accounts but conceded he may have said something in the bar meeting that caused offense. The inquiries had concluded that there was evidence to suggest he had violated the school’s sexual-harassment policy, and the second investigation led the dean to issue a letter of reprimand and require that Manweller undergo sexual-harassment training, according to records.After the Times article, Manweller’s first wife said she believed Manweller was grooming her when she was a high-school sophomore and he was a teacher at her school. The two married in June 2000, shortly after her graduation.The Times also reported the account of a woman who worked at the Legislature and complained last year about his conduct.That woman reported that she had a meeting with Manweller that she thought was to be about her career, but she said it ended up feeling more like a date. She said Manweller steered the conversation toward personal issues, made what she thought were flirtatious comments, put her coat around her and opened the door to his car for her to get in.Manweller has said he was only being polite and trying to help the woman.CWU placed him on leave in December and began the new investigation. Manweller stepped down from his position as assistant floor leader in the state House.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/education/2014/11/09/fired-ccc-official-accused-sexual-harassment/18758999/,"A Chemeketa Community College official, who was fired this year after a female employee accused him of sexual misconduct, had a sexual harassment complaint filed against him in 1999 when he worked at Lane Community College, the Statesman Journal has learned.A female employee raised concerns in 1999 that Lanning — then the division chairman of health, physical education and athletics at the college — was going to fire her for allegedly rejecting his sexual advances and questioning his integrity and decisions.""I had an enormous amount of respect for this man before all this began and now I do not trust him at all and even consider him to be a possible danger,"" the woman wrote in the complaint.The complaint was not upheld after a third-party investigation, according to documents released by the college from that year.The documents did not outline exactly why the complaint was unfounded. A lawyer for Lane Community College said there are no other records available related to the complaint the college could find. A call to Lanning's lawyer was not returned.The prior complaint came as a surprise to Chemeketa officials, who said they only recently learned about it after Lane responded to a public records request by the Statesman Journal. The college hired Lanning in 2007 after he worked at Lane for more than a decade. He became the college's Yamhill Valley Campus president in 2011.In May 2014, Lanning was the top pick to become the next president at Central Oregon Community College in Bend. But the college's board decided not to hire him after Lanning did not disclose to them he was on paid leave because of the complaint against him.A female employee, who is now suing the college and Lanning for at least $4.8 million in federal court, accused Lanning of raping her during an education conference in Portland. Lanning told a college investigator that what happened was consensual, but the college fired him in June after concluding he violated its sexual harassment policy.When COCC officials learned about the pending sexual misconduct complaint, it wasn't Chemeketa that tipped the college off.""That was a real dilemma for us and we chose to follow the advice our attorney that to do so would be violating Patrick's constitutional rights and potentially put us in a situation where the college might be subjected to litigation,"" said Greg Harris, a spokesman for Chemeketa.No known red flagsJeff Burgess, a training and development specialist with Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries, said it's unlikely an employer would find out about allegations against a prospective employee unless the claims were substantiated and he or she was disciplined.Typically, employers have the duty to disclose whether there is a propensity for violence, dangerous or criminal behavior, he said.""Employers kind of have to walk the fine line between respecting an employee's privacy and not divulging confidential information and limiting their exposure to a tort claim,"" he said.By revealing complaint information about an employee, it could sway the prospective employer's decision during the hiring process.""The concern for a lot of employers is by giving information about the existence of an investigation there might be a perception on the other end of the conversation that this person is guilty before they're proven innocent,"" Burgess said.Chemeketa found out about Lanning's prior sexual harassment complaint at Lane in late October, Harris said.""We had not heard about it at the time that he was hired. There was nothing provided to us from Lane that would indicate there was a problem,"" he said.The Statesman Journal submitted a public records request to Lane in May for any prior complaints filed against Lanning. The college initially told the newspaper there were no records, but when asked again about previous complaints, a new archivist was able to find one complaint using a different search method.At the time of the newspaper's request in May, the college had also just moved its archives into the basement of its former downtown Eugene instructional center.""As a result of her greater familiarity with both the physical archive files and the college's past archive practices, she was successful in locating one file responsive to your request,"" Meg Kieran, Lane Community College's lawyer wrote to the Statesman Journal on Oct. 31.The name of the woman who accused Lanning of sexual harassment was redacted from the documents.Lane Community College President Mary Spilde, who was vice president at the time the complaint was filed, said that without the investigation report she did not want to speculate about why it was unfounded.""I don't have the file either, so I can't refresh my memory about something that happened 15 years ago,"" she said.The college did a full investigation after the complaint was filed in 1999, Spilde said.""With no evidence to support a finding, the matter was closed. It would not be appropriate to share information about a complaint that was determined to be unfounded after a thorough process,"" she said.Former Chemeketa Community College President Cheryl Roberts worked with Lanning at Lane Community College.But the complaint was filed two years before she was hired by Lane Community College, according to her resume.""I had no idea. I had not heard anything about it when I was vice president there,"" Roberts said.When Lanning was first hired, Harris said, the college did a public records search into whether he had been arrested in the last seven years and conducted reference checks. Harris said once the college learned about the prior complaint at Lane, they went through records of Lanning's hiring process. The process is more rigorous now than it was the year Lanning was hired, he noted, with college officials talking to two direct supervisors of a prospective employee rather than just checking references provided to them by the candidate.They still could not find any red flags in Lanning's file.""We found nothing but positive recommendations,"" he said.A prior complaintIn 1999, a female employee filed a complaint to Lane Community College writing that she was uncomfortable with Lanning's flirting.""I believe Patrick Lanning has been harassing me in one form or another for a number of months now and I want this behavior to stop,"" she wrote. ""I would like to see him go through a complete psychological evaluation.""He told her that her voice sounded just as good on the phone as it did in person, suggested that he knew of a previous sexual encounter with an ex-boyfriend, told her that she was exactly like an ex-girlfriend of his and was inquisitive about her social life and men she was seeing, she wrote in the complaint.After a trip to Florence to meet a prospective instructor, she wrote in the complaint that she told Lanning she needed him to back out of her personal life.She then raised concerns about the hiring of a new prospective employee who she claims asked her and Lanning whether it would be known outside the college that she would be working with them.She raised other concerns, she wrote in the complaint, about the new employee including claims that she ignored students and made lengthy personal phone calls.""I informed Pat of these things but I felt my words were ignored,"" she wrote in the complaint.The woman who filed the complaint wrote that she was put on a 10-day trial period after Lanning alleged there were complaints about her from the faculty. The two had argued about office work, according to the complaint.""He has grown increasingly more erratic in his behavior and at the very least I want a full investigation into the allegations he had (lodged) against me and into his behavior,"" she wrote.On July 28, 1999, the woman received a letter from Lane Community College's President Jerry Moskus after the investigation was extended, potential witnesses were interviewed and the Sexual Harassment Hearings Committee met that month to review the complaint again.The complaint was not upheld.A history of sexual misconduct?A September lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by the woman who accused Lanning of sexual misconduct in 2014 alleges that Chemeketa Community College was negligent, failing to protect her from sexual abuse when they knew of Patrick Lanning's ""history of sexual misconduct.""That includes Lanning's prior sexual harassment of another female employee at Chemeketa in 2012, the lawsuit states.In February, a college employee accused Lanning of raping her at a Portland hotel room following a night of drinking and socializing during an education conference Feb. 6 and 7.The alleged rape was reported to the Port of Portland Police Department that month, but no criminal charges were filed against Lanning.The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office did not pursue the case, stating in May there was ""insufficient evidence to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""Lanning also threatened to sue the college in July for a breach of employment contract, defamation and failure to pay wages. In September, Chemeketa paid Lanning $38,391 to prevent him from filing a lawsuit in what could have been a more costly trial.The Statesman Journal submitted a public records request for any complaints against Lanning filed in 2012, but was told there were no records responsive to the request.""We are quite clear and we have indeed looked and there is no record in our files of anyone filing a complaint like what was filed at Lane Community College,"" Harris said.qwong@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6694 or follow at Twitter.com/QWongSJ.Technical Assistance for Employers ProgramThe Bureau of Labor and Industries runs a helpline that employers can call if they have questions about state and federal labor and employment laws.That phone number is 971-673-0824.Source: BOLI"

			A famed architect and CUNY dean has been put on leave after a student accused him of ­unwanted advances.
George Ranalli, 68, who has helmed the Spitzer School of Architecture since 1999, offered Ariella Campisi a ride home after the faculty holiday party at the Smoke Jazz  Supper Club in December 2013, Campisi claims in a Manhattan federal-court lawsuit. Campisi, now 23, was there because she worked part-time as an office assistant for the architecture school.
During the 30 minutes they spent idling in traffic on the West Side Highway, Ranalli began rubbing her knee and thigh “in a sexual manner right below where her skirt ended,” she claims.
When the dean stopped downtown to drop off an adjunct professor also riding in the car, Campisi tried to flee. But the educator was insistent she stay: “You look so beautiful tonight. Can I kiss you?” he allegedly asked.
The “disgusted” girl ran to the nearest restaurant restroom and burst into tears, according to the legal filing against CUNY and Ranalli. She reported the incident to her bosses the next day, and they promised an investigation.
It was 18 months later when Campisi asked for an update, and learned there was no probe. Her bosses had incorrectly reported the incident to the school’s Human Resources office, instead of the Office of Diversity and Compliance.
She accuses CUNY of “deliberate indifference.”
Ranalli was put on administrative leave in April. He categorically denies the allegations, said his lawyer, Andrew Celli Jr.
CUNY investigated, and disciplinary proceedings against Ranalli are ongoing, a school spokesman said.

WATERVILLE, Maine — A tenured economics professor at Colby College has resigned and the Maine State Police Computer Crimes unit is investigating allegations he secretly recorded video of a female student in a bathroom while on a school trip to China.



The Morning Sentinel of Waterville says Philip Brown has not been charged with a crime.



On Jan. 28, Colby College President William Adams wrote students and staff that Brown had resigned after the college indicated it was prepared to fire him over a “violation of student privacy.”




An affidavit filed in court in Augusta says that on Jan. 22 two students on the China trip found computer images of a partially clothed female student.



Brown later told college officials the students’ allegations were true.



Brown could not be reached for comment.

http://www.gainesville.com/news/20160714/cf-professor-accused-of-sexual-battery-on-student,"Austin L. Miller Staff writerA 41-year-old assistant professor at the College of Central Florida was arrested Thursday morning on suspicion of sexual battery against a female student.Ryan Meany faces two counts of sexual battery. He was arrested around 9 a.m. and was released from the Marion County Jail at 4:34 p.m. on $30,000 bond. Meany denied a reporter's request for an interview.The incident allegedly occurred early Thursday morning, according to Ocala Police Department Detective Dustin Todd’s report.The woman — who is in her early 20s and is a former student of the communications teacher — told police she contacted Meany to meet for coffee and talk about a position she was interested in, the report states.Instead of coffee, she said, he suggested they meet for beer. She met him at The Crazy Cucumber in Ocala for beers and conversation.About an hour later, he suggested they go to O'Malley's Alley in downtown Ocala, where she had a few more drinks, according to the OPD report. She became sick and went to the bathroom to throw up.At one point, the woman said two other women entered the bathroom and asked her if she needed help, the report states. She said he came in and, while she was vomiting, smacked her buttocks and touched her inappropriately.The woman said she told Meany to stop and to call her boyfriend to come get her. She said Meany stopped and said he would take her home.Instead, he took her to his home on Northeast 17th Court.On the way, she said, he repeatedly asked her to spread her legs while he slapped her legs and groin area. The woman said she kept telling him no, according to Todd’s report.The woman said she asked why he didn’t take her home. He told her, the woman said, that she should come inside and he would call her boyfriend to come pick her up, the report states. He allegedly told her to be quiet because his girlfriend was sleeping.Lying on the couch, the woman said she felt sick. Meany removed her shorts, despite her telling him no, and had oral sex with her, according to Todd's report. She said Meany used her cellphone to call her boyfriend.When the boyfriend arrived, the woman overheard him asking Meany why her pants were down but Meany didn’t answer.Todd interviewed the boyfriend, who said he was aware of the meeting. The man said he became concerned when he got to Meany’s home and saw his girlfriend’s pants ""were undone,"" according to the report. The boyfriend said he questioned Meany about it but did not get an answer.After the incident was reported, Meany went to OPD, where he denied any inappropriate sexual contact with the woman. According to the report, however, Meany told the detective the woman ""may have sat on his face sexually at his house"" and that he ""may have accidentally"" touched her while her pants were down in the bathroom.Meany said the woman never said no — or yes — to him.Asked if CF would suspend — or take any action — against Meany, spokeswoman Lois Brauckmuller said the college had no comment. ""At the College of Central Florida, the safety of our college community it among our highest priorities. We will not comment on any ongoing investigation,"" she said.— Contact Austin L. Miller at 352-867-4118, austin.miller@ocala.com or @almillerosb."
https://www.ocala.com/news/20160927/ex-cf-prof-wont-be-charged-in-sex-case,"The State Attorney’s Office is declining to prosecute a former College of Central Florida assistant professor accused of sexually battering a student.Authorities arrested Ryan Meany, 41, in mid-July after a female student reported that he took advantage when the two met for drinks and discussion. She reported two instances of sexual contact — in a bar bathroom and at Meany’s home in Ocala — that she said were not consensual.In filing its determination in Meany’s case, Assistant State Attorney Debra Munchel wrote that additional witnesses and a laboratory analysis paint a more complete picture of the evening. This picture suggests the likelihood of conviction at trial is slight.CF placed Meany on administrative leave following his arrest. He subsequently resigned. The college's internal investigation into the matter is ongoing and independent of the criminal proceeding, a CF spokeswoman said on Tuesday.Much of what happened between Meany and the woman is not disputed, according to Munchel’s assessment. Both told authorities that they arranged to meet at the Crazy Cucumber about 8:30 p.m. July 13 to discuss an opportunity at the college. The conversation there skewed more personal over two or so drinks each, according to the document, and they agreed to continue the evening at O’Malley’s Alley about 10 p.m.The student became ill following more drinks at O’Malley’s, according to the document. She went to a bathroom at the bar to vomit. When the bar was closing, Meany and a security guard followed her, helped her off the floor, and walked her to Meany’s car.Once at Meany’s house, according to the document, Meany performed sex acts on the student. Afterward he called the student’s boyfriend who, according to the document, “took her to the hospital, called police department and instituted a report of sexual abuse on behalf of the victim.”The student reported that she did not consent to sex acts with Meany that night, including an instance she described in the bar bathroom in which she alleged that Meany digitally penetrated her.Meany initially denied any sexual contact while they were at his home. Later he said that “she may have sat on his face” and that she did not say “stop” or “no” while they were at his home.Of the bathroom incident, he told authorities that he pulled her pants up, because she was unable to do so herself, and that he “may have accidentally penetrated her while her pants were down.”Munchel references conversations with the bartender and Meany’s live-in girlfriend, who was at the home when the two returned to it that night, to clarify these events.The bartender said the student did not object to getting in Meany’s car, according to the document. The live-in girlfriend said she did not hear “anything from the victim that would indicate she was not enjoying herself.”Laboratory reports indicate that the student was not drugged that evening, according to the document, and the bartender’s statement suggests that her consumption of alcohol was voluntary.Voluntary intoxication, according to case law that Munchel cites in the document, does not render a person helpless and unable to communicate unwillingness to participate in a sex act.Munchel writes: “Since the victim was not physically helpless, but impaired by her own voluntary intoxication, if she did not consent to the sexual contact, she would have had to make that known to the defendant in order for the defendant’s actions to rise to the level of crime.”Contact Nicki Gorny at 352-867-4065, nicki.gorny@ocala.com or @Nicki_Gorny."

AFFIRMED


  
    
      
Gregory Samuel Forman, of Charleston, for Appellant/Respondent.
Stephen L. Brown, Wilbur E. Johnson, and Russell G. Hines, all of
  Charleston, for Respondent/Appellant.
      
    
  

PER CURIAM:  In
  this cross-appeal, Appellant/Respondent Dr. Robin Bowers appeals from an order
  of the Administrative Law Court (the ALC) affirming Bowers' termination as a
  tenured professor at Respondent/Appellant College of Charleston (the College). 
  Bowers argues on appeal that the College denied him due process and there is no
  evidence to support the College's decision to terminate his employment.  On
  cross-appeal, the College argues the ALC erred by enforcing an automatic stay
  which required the College to pay Bowers' wages during the pendency of his
  appeal to the ALC.  We affirm.
1.  As to Bowers' argument that the College's grievance procedures
  denied him due process by placing an impermissible limitation on his counsel's
  participation, we find the issue unpreserved because Bowers did not object to
  the grievance procedures at either the prehearing conference or the hearing
  itself.  See Lee Cnty. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Trs. v. MLD Charter Sch.
    Acad. Planning Comm., 371 S.C. 561, 566, 641 S.E.2d 24, 27 (2007)
  (""[An appellate court] has a limited scope of review and cannot consider
  issues that were not raised to and ruled on by the administrative
  agency."").
2.  As to Bowers' argument that the complaints, text messages, and
  deposition were unreliable evidence and admitted upon an unlawful procedure, we
  find the issue unpreserved.  In regard to the complaints and text messages, we
  find the issue unpreserved because Bowers did not object to the admission of this
  evidence.  See Burke v. AnMed Health, 393 S.C. 48, 54, 710 S.E.2d 84, 87 (Ct. App. 2011) (providing a contemporaneous objection to the admission
  of evidence is typically required to preserve issues for appellate review).  As
  to the deposition of Raven Ray, the hearing committee informed the parties at
  the beginning of the hearing that Ray did not feel comfortable testifying
  unless her attorney was present.  The committee stated it had no objection to
  Ray's attorney observing the proceedings, but it would only allow Ray's
  attorney to do so if both parties agreed.  Bowers objected, and therefore the
  committee decided it would not allow Ray's attorney to be present.  Later in
  the proceedings, Bowers objected to the admission of Ray's deposition into
  evidence.  The committee decided to admit the deposition, finding Bowers had an
  opportunity to question Ray by either agreeing to allow her attorney to observe
  the proceedings or by submitting counter affidavits.  Bowers' attorney
  responded by saying she was unaware at the time she objected to Ray's attorney
  being present that the alternative was the committee would allow Ray's
  deposition in as evidence and Bowers would not have an opportunity to
  cross-examine Ray.  The committee explained it lacked subpoena power and again offered
  Bowers the opportunity to have Ray testify in the presence of her attorney.  After
  Bowers and his attorney discussed the matter, Bowers' attorney told the
  committee Bowers did not wish to delay the proceedings any further by having
  Ray testify and they were ready to continue.  The committee then asked Bowers
  if he would prefer to have Ray's deposition admitted into evidence rather than
  have her testify in the presence of her attorney.  Bowers responded by
  restating his objection to Ray's attorney being present and stated he just
  wanted to move along with the proceedings because he did not believe he would
  get much out of having Ray testify.  Bowers' attorney then said to Bowers,
  ""Sure, it's your case.""  We find Bowers waived his prior objection to
  the admissibility of the deposition by deciding he wanted to move along the
  proceedings when the committee yet again presented Bowers the option and
  opportunity to have Ray testify.  See CFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty.
    Assessor, __ S.C. __, 716 S.E.2d 877, 885 (2011) (holding CFRE waived on
  appeal its claim that the trial court erred by not sanctioning property tax
  assessor for its failure to formally respond to CFRE's interrogatories and
  production requests, where the trial court offered to continue the proceedings
  and order a formal response from the assessor, but CFRE declined the court's
  invitation and agreed that a continuance would be unlikely to produce anything
  further).
3.  As to Bowers' argument that he was not required to preserve
  issues related to his right to counsel or evidentiary procedures, we find the
  exception to the general rule of error preservation noted in Ex parte
    Jackson, 381 S.C. 253, 672 S.E.2d 585 (Ct. App. 2009), is not applicable in
  this case because Bowers had counsel present and actively representing him at
  all times during the prehearing conference and the hearing itself.  See id. at 261 n.3, 672 S.E.2d  at 589 n.3 (holding a pro se litigant could not be
  expected to raise the issue of whether he was entitled to counsel).
4.  As to Bowers' argument that the College denied him due process
  by not allowing him to confront Ray at the hearing, we find no error because Bowers'
  inability to cross-examine Ray was a result of his own conduct.  Ray agreed to appear
  and testify at the hearing so long as her attorney could be present.  Although
  the hearing committee explained to Bowers that Ray's attorney would be present
  in an observatory role only, Bowers did not agree to allow Ray's attorney to be
  present during her testimony.  Thus, Bowers' inability to cross-examine Ray was
  not a denial of due process.  See Zaman v. S.C. State Bd. of Med.
    Exam'rs, 305 S.C. 281, 285, 408 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (holding a party
  cannot complain of a violation of due process if the party has recourse to a
  constitutionally sufficient administrative procedure, but merely fails to take
  advantage of it); In re Vora, 354 S.C. 590, 600, 582 S.E.2d 413, 418
  (2003) (""Due process is not violated where a party is not given the
  opportunity to confront witnesses so long as there has been a meaningful
  opportunity to be heard."").
5.  As to Bowers' argument that the record contains no evidence
  that his communications or actions towards Ray met the College's definition of
  ""sexual harassment,"" we find Ray's deposition, Bowers' text messages
  to Ray, and the lyrics of the poem posted on the internet, all provided evidence
  from which the College could reasonably find Bowers in violation of the College's
  sexual harassment policy.  See Risher v. S.C. Dep't of Health 
    Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 210, 712 S.E.2d 428, 434 (2011) (holding
  ""substantial evidence"" sufficient to support a finding of the ALC is
  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds
  to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached); Spruill v.
    Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist. 2, 363 S.C. 61, 65, 609 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2005)
  (providing the appellate court traditionally defers to an agency's construction
  of its own regulation and the appellate court will not overturn such construction
  absent compelling reasons); ESA Servs., LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 392
  S.C. 11, 24, 707 S.E.2d 431, 438 (Ct. App. 2011) (holding a reviewing court may
  reverse or modify decisions that are controlled by error of law or are clearly
  erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the record as a whole).[1]
6.  As to the College's argument that the ALC erred by enforcing
  an automatic stay pursuant to ALC Rule 34, we find no error because enforcement
  of the stay merely held Bowers in the same position that he was in prior to his
  termination, on suspension with pay, pending the final decision of the ALC.  See ALC Rule 34 (""The filing of an appeal from the final decision of an agency
  shall stay the final decision of that agency . . . .""); Santee Cooper
    Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 298 S.C. 179, 184, 379 S.E.2d 119,
  122 (1989) (""To stay an order is to hold it in abeyance or refrain from
  enforcing it; a stay is a stopping."" (internal quotations omitted)); Graham
    v. Graham, 301 S.C. 128, 130, 390 S.E.2d 469, 470 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding
  the purpose of a stay is to preserve the status quo pending the determination
  on appeal).
 AFFIRMED.
 HUFF,
  PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.  


[1] Because we find sufficient evidence to support the
  College's decision to terminate Bowers' employment for his violation of the
  College's sexual harassment policy, we need not address Bowers' remaining
  arguments regarding other grounds asserted by the College as justification for
  its decision.  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,
  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing an appellate court need
  not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).

              "">A group of former students wrote Holy Cross president Rev. Philip L. Boroughs earlier this month, charging that Christie “is an imminent danger to students on your campus.”“Several of us were sexually abused by Prof. Christie while we were Holy Cross students,” the group wrote in its Aug. 3 letter. “Holy Cross has enabled Prof. Christie’s misconduct, and has a responsibility now to respond to our coming forward as quickly and decisively as possible.”Get The Big To-DoYour guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more.In a statement to the Globe on Thursday, Holy Cross said the college “was informed of allegations of serious misconduct and immediately placed Mr. Christie on administrative leave, in accordance with college policy. Mr. Christie had submitted a letter of resignation, and he will not be returning to the College.”An Oberlin spokesperson referred the Globe to a general statement dated Thursday on the school’s website regarding recent allegations of sexual misconduct against unnamed faculty members. In a Thursday e-mail to Oberlin students, staff, and faculty obtained by the Globe, conservatory dean Andrea Kalyn said the school’s Title IX officer recently received reports that Christie had allegedly violated Oberlin’s sexual misconduct policy.“Professor Christie was informed of these allegations and was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation,” wrote Kalyn. “He has resigned, and no longer teaches at Oberlin.”A Wellesley spokeswoman said the college has “no record of any complaints” against Christie, adding that in 2016 he was classified as an independent contractor there.Christie, 66, did not respond to multiple telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.Christie, who was named International Performer of the Year for 2017 by the American Guild of Organists’ New York City Chapter, has performed with many of the world’s great orchestras during his long career. He has appeared on numerous recordings and has strong ties to the Boston area, where his work with the BSO has been singled out by reviewers in recent years.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the BSO said the orchestra had been unaware of the allegations against Christie, who performed with the orchestra as a freelance musician and has no formal title with the BSO.“The Boston Symphony Orchestra has never had complaints against Mr. Christie,” the statement read. “Mr. Christie is not on the schedule to perform with the BSO this upcoming season, and there are no plans to engage him for future performances with the orchestra.”In multiple interviews with the Globe, former students at Holy Cross and Oberlin described a consistent pattern of sexual harassment by Christie. Some said the organist used his considerable artistic standing to manipulate and cajole students, dangling before them entrance to some of classical music’s most rarefied circles. Former students also described a sexually charged environment that included lewd comments, large amounts of alcohol, and unwanted touching over a period between 1994 and 2017.Two of the former Holy Cross students who signed the letter also described long-term sexual relationships Christie initiated with them as undergraduates. The two men, who were younger than 21 at the time, said the relationships often involved heavy drinking and unprotected sex in a variety of public spaces, including green rooms, concert halls, Christie’s office at Holy Cross, and in and around the pipe organ at the school’s Saint Joseph Memorial Chapel.The Globe confirmed key elements of the former students’ accounts through e-mails, Facebook messages, and interviews with friends and acquaintances who either witnessed the events firsthand or learned of them soon after they occurred.The five signatories to the Holy Cross letter were all recipients of a prestigious organ scholarship at the school, a position that involves assistant duties and close study with Christie, who has served as distinguished artist-in-residence at the school for more than 30 years.The former students said Christie frequently injected sexual topics into conversation and often physically groped them, rubbing their thighs, proffering massages, and grabbing their rear ends.“I also heard descriptions of the size and shape of other men’s penises — other professors, concert organists, and students,” Jeff Wood, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2006 and went on to study with Christie at Oberlin, recalled in a written account of his experiences that he shared with the Globe and the Title IX office at Holy Cross.<div id="""" class=""image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "">Brett Maguire (left), Jake Street, and Sean Redrow, seen at Holy Cross’s Saint Joseph Memorial Chapel, were among five former students to accuse James David Christie. Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffJake Street, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2010 and also went on to study with Christie at Oberlin, said Christie would often discuss his sexual conquests and the sexual anatomies and predilections of others.Street recalled a 2010 trip to Toronto where he and Christie drank heavily, eventually arriving one evening at his mentor’s hotel room.“At some point, my belt and zipper were undone, and my pants were down around my knees,” Street recalled in a written account of his experiences he shared with the Globe. He says he does not remember who removed his pants: “I remember him getting quiet in that moment, and I eventually fled.”Jennifer McPherson, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2013 and previously dated Street, recalled that Street told her about the experience after the Toronto trip.She added that Christie would often press her for information about her own sex life. “If I did not joke with him in return, he would then say I was prudish and should experiment more,” McPherson recalled in a written statement. “Sex was one of his favorite subjects. If I wanted to be a part of Jim’s ‘circle,’ I had to play along.”Wesley Hall, who studied extensively with Christie at Oberlin despite what he called the organist’s repeated unwanted physical contact, put it succinctly: “He’s the best organ teacher in America, and he could destroy your dreams.”Hall, who said he has spoken with the Title IX office at Oberlin, added: “He has asked me at least 10 times in lessons if I wanted to take my shirt off.”Sean Redrow first met Christie when he was an aspiring organist in high school, practicing before a master class with Christie.He was soon taking lessons with Christie, securing the coveted organ scholarship to Holy Cross starting in 1994.The relationship quickly went beyond mere touching at the keyboard, as Christie lavished praise and affection on his young student, telling him he was a rare talent and giving him a glimpse of life as a musician of international renown: “money, power . . . the College job at the school I loved more than anyplace or anything ever. He said he’d give it to me when he retired,” recalled Redrow in a written statement. “I would have to be prepared to give up all of my connections to family and friends because being an artist of my caliber would require frequent travel and/or moving to different parts of the country and globe in order to live up to my gift.”Redrow said the relationship soon turned sexual and involved heavy drinking. “We’d have some drinks, or wine, and then we would have sex,” said Redrow, adding that some of the episodes occurred at the home of Christie, who then lived in Newton.In one episode, Redrow recalled he and Christie were helping tune the organ at the Holy Cross chapel.“He took his penis out of his pants, started stroking it, and saying, ‘Come on,’ ” recalled Redrow, who said his professor was urging him to perform fellatio.Brett Maguire, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2002 and went on to study with his mentor at Oberlin, said Christie told him about the episode with Redrow in the organ loft.Maguire explained that the first gay sexual experience of his own life was with Christie, initiated by his teacher.“Christie has amazing artistic privilege . . . at Holy Cross to hand select from the most talented young organ students, to groom them as he sees fit,” Maguire said in a statement. “He has abused this position, using his power of selection to surround himself with insecure young men — teenagers — to satisfy his sexual appetites.”Malcolm Gay can be reached at malcolm.gay@globe.com.

https://www.telegram.com/news/20190620/holy-cross-finds-former-college-organist-sexually-harassed-students,"WORCESTER - The College of the Holy Cross has completed an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against former college organist James David Christie and found Mr. Christie subjected students to “prohibited sexual harassment,” according to a notice from the college that was emailed to complainants last week.The penalties to be brought by the college include a black mark on Mr. Christie’s employment record, a permanent ban from campus, and revocation of any past honors and awards. Restitution for the victims remains to be determined.More:Professor accused of sexual misconduct no longer at Holy CrossThe college will issue a public statement to the Holy Cross community announcing the ruling and penalties against Mr. Christie as soon as a period set aside for appeals has concluded, a spokesman for the college, John Hill, said Thursday.Two of the alumni who made the accusations against their former organ teacher commented Thursday: ""Holy Cross reached the only result it could - that James David Christie violated College policy.""The College has indicated it will now discuss remedial measures with us,"" the two former students, Jacob Street and Sean Redrow, said in a joint text message. ""We are waiting to see if the College, as Christie's employer, takes substantive responsibility for Christie's egregious misconduct and its impact on all of us.""Mr. Street and Mr. Redrow were among five former holders of the college’s coveted Organ Scholarship who last summer publicly accused Mr. Christie, the college’s distinguished artist-in-residence and one of the most acclaimed organists of his generation, of sexual misconduct.Mr. Christie resigned and was barred from campus. Holy Cross launched what the college’s president, the Rev. Philip Boroughs, pledged would be an “aggressive and thorough” review of the allegations against the organist, who was accused of having pressed himself sexually on student proteges, even in the organ loft of the campus chapel.Tracy Kennedy, director of the college’s Office of Title IX Initiatives, responsible for investigating reports of sexual misconduct on campus, sent an email June 14 to the former students who had lodged the complaints against Mr. Christie, summarizing the findings of the investigation and the sanctions to be assigned.Mr. Redrow posted excerpts to his Facebook page on Saturday. “HC Title IX has spoken,” he wrote. “Our part still to be figured out.” The Telegram  Gazette independently verified the content of the email the Holy Cross administrator sent the complainants.Ms. Kennedy wrote that an investigatory panel had concluded that Mr. Christie - never named in the communication, but referred to only as “the Responding Party” - had engaged in unwelcome and inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature that constituted prohibited sexual harassment.She described the sanctions handed down: Mr. Christie’s employment record with the college would reflect he had been terminated for cause; a campus no-trespass order against him would be made permanent; and any past awards or honors to him from the college would be revoked.She wrote that Mr. Christie did not elect to participate in the investigation or resolution process, was not interviewed, and did not review or respond to the investigation report. He cannot appeal the result.Mr. Christie, 67, of Natick, has been influential in classical music circles as an organist for the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Wellesley College, as well as Holy Cross and Oberlin College.In August, the former Organ Scholars wrote to Rev. Boroughs and told their story to The Boston Globe, which reported their allegations of lewd comments, unwanted touching and sexual misconduct by Mr. Christie at Holy Cross between 1994 and 2017.Oberlin College in February announced the results of its own investigation into similar allegations against Mr. Christie, finding the organist “in all likelihood grossly abused his position of trust.” According to a former student, Mr. Christie’s nickname at the Ohio college was “the Harvey Weinstein of the Music Department.”Phone and email messages to Mr. Christie this week were not returned. Contacted in person at his home in South Natick in November, he declined to comment.The former Holy Cross Organ Scholars who raised the allegations are Mr. Redrow (class of 1998), Mr. Street (class of 2010), Jeffrey Wood (class of 2006), Brett Maguire (class of 2002) and Jennifer McPherson (class of 2013).Holy Cross’ Organ Scholarship, traditionally awarded every other year to a talented music major, provides full tuition (currently more than $52,000 annually) for four years, and is highly coveted. CBS New York has described it as “perhaps the most prestigious scholarship for the organ in America.”With the scholarship comes the responsibility of playing the 52-foot-high, 10-ton baroque pipe organ in Holy Cross’ St. Joseph’s Chapel at Masses and other college events, and assisting the college organist with all aspects of the chapel music program.Until last summer, that meant studying and working closely with Mr. Christie, who had been considered one of the most distinguished organ teachers in the nation, influential in the making of aspiring musicians’ careers.The accusations against Mr. Christie were the first in a series of allegations of faculty sexual misconduct that have roiled the campus of New England’s oldest Jesuit college over the past year.Misconduct claims also were made public against Christopher Dustin, a philosophy professor who was removed as dean of faculty and placed on leave after allegations were brought to light of unwanted sexual advances made upon former students.Meantime, students demanding greater transparency about sexual assault at the college created an Instagram page for posting anonymous accounts of date rape on campus, and in February staged a two-day sit-in outside the office of the college president.In April, Rev. Boroughs declined to retain an independent investigator to look into allegations of faculty sexual misconduct at the college, despite being urged to do so by faculty leaders. The Faculty Assembly voted to call on the board of trustees to appoint an independent counsel nonetheless.Last month, 87 members of the faculty signed a letter describing frustration at what was termed the administration’s “unwillingness to answer questions central to this brewing crisis.” Many faculty members at the college’s 173rd commencement exercises wore teal stoles with their academic regalia as a mark of solidarity with survivors of harassment and assault.Video: Worcester By Bike "

      THE ""SLOCUM AFFAIR"" AT COLORADO COLLEGE
       
       
      William F. Slocum was president of Colorado College from 1888-1917. During his presidency, the college grew from 50 students to 500 and from a single building to sixteen. His wife, Mary Slocum, founded the Woman's Educational Society at CC. After an investigation into his behavior with women at the college (students, staff, faculty, and faculty wives), the Board of Trustees asked for and received Slocum's resignation. He spent the 1916-1917 school year abroad and officially left CC after the 1917 commencement celebration.

      EXCERPTS FROM WOMEN'S STATEMENTS selected and with occasional paraphrases (in brackets) by CC archivist Jessy Randall, 2017.
      
        Maude S. Bard [CC class of 1912, secretary to the president 1912-1916, later wife  of CC professor Edward R. Warren]:
      When I came  to the College in the spring of 1908, was warned by Miss Stevenson, as to what  I should expect from the President.
        When I  returned in September, 1912, Mrs. Bushee also warned me, as she, too, had had  to protect herself against Mr. Slocum.
       At first I  felt the protestations of love for me were genuine, and that it was incumbent  upon me, to try to save him from himself, and to save his self-respect. It  gradually dawned upon me, that I was dealing with a man of strong and evil  passions and that my only effort must be to protect myself.
       As two  evidences of the struggle which ensued, I cite the following:
       One  afternoon in the Spring of 1913, in the President’s office, at Palmer Hall, Mr.  Slocum took me by the shoulders, forced me to stand against the east wall of  his office, and pressed his whole body against mine, especially emphasizing the  pressure at the portion of his body and mine most calculated to arouse and  satisfy physical passion. I struggled to free myself, and fled from the office.  This particular form of bestiality he never attempted again.
       On  commencement day of this year, June 9, 1915, I was in the library of the President’s  home, when I fainted. A doctor was summoned, who directed I should lie on the  couch, until my own doctor could come to me. A woman friend was left to watch  me, while Mr.  Mrs. Slocum went to the Alumni Banquet at Cossitt Memorial.  Between courses the President came to his house to see me. Bending over the  couch, with back to the other persons in the room, he inserted his hand under  the clothing covering my chest, and stating that the doctor had told him to  watch my heart action, passed his hand again and again over me, as far down as  he could reach. I tried to protect myself by pushing him away as much as my  condition would permit. The next day he reminded me of this effort on my part,  and told me I had been a prude. This happened at my home on the next morning  after I had fainted. Mr. Slocum called to see me and was left alone with me. I  was in bed being too weak to get up. He repeated the insult of the day before,  still under the cover of the necessity of watching the heart action. Then  suddenly he stooped over me, laid his hand on my chest, and exclaimed, “Oh, I  love you so!”
        These are  two or three instances of the President’s persecution of a woman who works for  him. I can give others, but none more flagrant. I also know, from my personal  observation, that the women students in the college are not safe alone with the  President in his office.
      
         
      Supplement of Miss Bard’s statement by Jean Auld [CC class of 1908; instructor  in Greek and Latin 1909-1911]:
      Yes, I  remember the incident you speak of, though of course I couldn’t see it all. I  remember I was astonished and shocked at his manner. He sat down on the couch  beside you, as I recall it, and bent down over you very close while he felt  your pulse. Then he remarked that he was a physician, too, and added something  in an undertone which I couldn’t catch. I then saw him thrust his hand under  your clothes to feel your heart. That of course was all I could see, except  your expression of repugnance.
      
       
       
       
      Harriet Sater [CC cashier, 1910-1918]:
       To feel  that I have not only been insulted once, but many times, has been a thing which  I have had to live with mentally. I have had to put up with “handling,”  insinuating looks and insidious familiarities, in many of the private  interviews which I have had with him, in obeying his wanting “to see me for a  few minutes.” I am unable to express the looks which have left me boiling with  a sense of shame and disgrace. The constant need of having his hand on your  body, feeling it, are things a woman cannot mistake. A constant desire to  always bring the physical side in is always present. [...] Another illustration [...]  at the end of a normal conversation, when he asked me if I was engaged, I  answered “No,” and like a flash the lights were turned off, and before I was  aware of what was happening, I was seized in his arms, and he said, “You have  got to kiss me.” The lights were turned off another time, but the second time I  was prepared. [...] I have been talked to on “cold-heartedness,” which was purely in  a physical way.

      Twice, much against my will, I was obliged to telephone (in  Mrs. Slocum’s absence) for Miss [name not given in transcription] to come down  from [place not given] on “important business.” Mrs. [name not given] told me  that Miss [name not given] spent the night at the Slocum house. When Miss [name  not given] was in evidence, I was moved into another office [...] to get me out of  the way.
      
      
       
      Anonymous former instructor:
      Of course I have known for a long time that Pres. Slocum has  a most disgusting attitude toward women who are unsuspicious, young, and thrown  into contact with him [...] Dr. Slocum made himself extremely disagreeable to me  for the first few weeks, cropping into my room in [name not given], late in the  evening, and saying many sentimental and silly things. I was young then and  felt very guilty, as though I had brought such familiarity on myself, and I  finally asked [name not given] about it. She told me that the experience was  fairly common [...] By never staying in my room alone in the evening the difficulty  finally relieved itself [...] I could not repeat anything he said. The impression  of him, however, is a very horrid one, and the trapping feeling when he took  advantage of his age and position and his friendship for my family, I can  assure you I have never forgotten.
       
      
        
      Anonymous graduate:
      I sat quite close to his desk in the chair he placed for me.  In the midst of the conversation he suddenly stopped, and leaning down, began  to look at me in a way which I cannot describe in any words save bestial [...] I  left the room at once. He simply sat at his desk and watched me go. I was never  alone with him after that [...] such a man has no right to occupy a position of  power over the lives of young men and young women, who are bound to hold him in  honor and respect.
       
       
              Anonymous student:
      The first act of President Slocum which attracted my  attention was a too minute and familiar examination of a brooch I was wearing.  Soon after that he had me blot checks for him on several occasions [...] he said he  would find out when I was scheduled for office work and sign checks at those  times. One these occasions he seemed to wish the door to his office closed,  wanted me to sit very near him, and would look at my wrist watch now and then,  each time laying his hand on my hand or wrist [...] the expression of the man’s  eyes, when he looked at me, offended and horrified me. These instances appear  trivial to my reason, but [...] I have lain awake nights with the thing on my mind.

      [After a college dinner at the Acacia Hotel, Mrs. Persons  accompanied an injured Mrs. Slocum home. When Mrs. Slocum was settled, she  entered a dark room with Dr. Slocum to get her coat.] He put his arm around me  and then the first thing I knew he kissed me, on the mouth, and in the act our  eyeglasses became entangled. He turned on the lights to find our glasses and I  got out of the room. He was all this time calling me endearing terms [...] He  wanted to take me home, but I insisted on being taken back to the hotel, where  Mr. Persons was. From his house to the hotel he drove just as slowly as was  possible, all the while calling me endearing names, trying to hold my hand [...]  and several times he put his arms around me.
       
      
        
       
      Florence Leidigh [CC class of 1902, assistant to Dean of Women Ruth Loomis 1902]:
      During the early days of my freshman year, I was horrified at the discovery that the College's President was a man who made shocking advances to students and other women. One of my intimate friends [...] told me of her fear at being left alone with Dr. Slocum, even for a moment. If so left in a room of his own home, she was invariably made to submit to the most startling caresses. My greatest shock, however, came with the knowledge, that the President, almost every evening, was in the closed rooms of one of the officials of the girls' hall -- often remaining until after midnight [...] I could continue indefinitely with tales of young girls who  had horrifying experience with their president: one in a public train, another  in a closed carriage [...]

      The first time the rumors began to come to me about Mr.  Slocum was about ten years ago. At that time there were relations with a lady,  who was a member of the faculty, which seemed to be foolishness, but were  entirely out of accord with the doctrines of the right relations of the sexes  preached from the chapel desk and in social committee meetings. Then perhaps  five or six years ago I began to hear more definite things concerning the  relations of Mr. Slocum to women members of the faculty, secretaries, and  students [...] [Parsons consults with Professor Schneider, who has some medical training. Schneider] felt that the dangers were very  great and could not be overlooked, that there was a pathological condition [...] [Parsons speaks with CC Trustee Philip B. Stewart, who said]  many men  do the things which Mr. Slocum had done and are not caught, but Mr. Slocum had  been caught, and he simply could not be retained in his present position [...]

      The fact was that Slocum was an erotic. No woman was safe from insult when left alone with him. Stories by the hundreds and affidavits by the dozen poured in proving that college girls, women secretaries, wives of professors, married women in town, pretty or homely, old or young, all were liable to shocking caresses and suggestive language from Slocum. Someway, while rumors had been abroad for many years, nobody dared expose the old libertine. His position and his power as well as women's modesty protected him through twenty-seven years in Colorado Springs. He was hated by students and distrusted by faculty folk because of his faithlessness, his lying, and his double-dealing. But until these young women were goaded to speak, no one had the courage to attack him.

Sharon KARIBIAN, Plaintiff,
v.
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, John Borden and Mark Urban, Defendants.
No. 91 Civ. 3135 (TPG).
United States District Court, S.D. New York.
February 3, 1993.
*414 Elizabeth L. Koob, Koob  Magoolaghan, New York City, for plaintiff.
Diane S. Wilner, Wilner  Associates, P.C., New York City, for Columbia and Borden.
Corwin  Solomon, New York City, for Urban. 

*415 OPINION
GRIESA, District Judge.
This is a sexual harassment case. There is a claim against Columbia University under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. There are also various claims against Columbia under state law theories. Defendants Borden and Urban are sued solely under state law theories.
Defendants Columbia and Borden move for summary judgment. The motion is granted. For reasons hereafter set forth, the Title VII claim against Columbia must be dismissed because there is no triable issue of fact. As to the state law claims against Columbia and the claims against Borden, there is no jurisdiction after dismissal of the Title VII portion of the action.
Although Urban has not made a motion, the court dismisses the action against him on its own motion, for lack of jurisdiction. 
FACTS
In late 1986 while plaintiff was a student at Columbia, she obtained part-time employment with the University. The office she worked at was called ""Telefund at Columbia University."" Although it was part of the University, its activities were to some extent designed and administered by a separate company called Philanthropy Management, Inc. (""PMI""). The people working at Telefund consisted of both Columbia University employees and PMI employees. Telefund operated under the aegis of an entity at Columbia called University Development and Alumni Relations (""UDAR"").
Defendant Urban was employed by Columbia University commencing in September 1987. He worked in UDAR and his duties included responsibility for Telefund. Borden was Deputy Vice President of UDAR from April 1, 1988 until sometime in 1991. He was Urban's superior.
Plaintiff alleges that she met Urban in the spring of 1987, before Urban went to work for Columbia. She alleges that Urban pressured her into having sexual relations commencing shortly after they met and continuing through 1989.
Columbia has an established mechanism for dealing with sexual harassment. Columbia publishes a bulletin entitled ""Protection Against Sexual Harassment."" The bulletin starts with a Policy Statement, which includes the unequivocal declaration that ""the University prohibits sexual harassment of any member of the Columbia community."" The bulletin describes remedies provided by the University. A person who believes that he or she is being sexually harassed is invited to confer with a member of the University Panel on Sexual Harassment. There is also provision for the aggrieved party (or the panel member with permission of the aggrieved party) to discuss the problem with the University's Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (""EOAA""). Finally, the party alleging sexual harassment may file a grievance under the applicable University grievance procedure.
It is agreed by both sides that the first two steps  i.e., resort to the University Panel on Sexual Harassment or resort to the EOAA  are entirely confidential. This means that there is no effort to investigate the matter or to obtain a remedy against the alleged guilty party. The grievance procedure, on the other hand, is not confidential and sets in motion an investigation and other steps which may lead to remedial action against the party complained of.
During September 1988 plaintiff consulted with one of the members of the Sexual Harassment Panel and also with an employee at the EOAA. Plaintiff concedes that she knew that these consultations were confidential. The EOAA employee has stated, without contradiction, that plaintiff specifically requested that there be no investigation at that time. The sexual relations between plaintiff and Urban continued.
Plaintiff claims that in April 1989, after Urban allegedly forced her to perform a sexual act, she related this incident to Loren Spivack, an employee of PMI. Plaintiff asserts that Spivack informed her that he had relayed the information to the president *416 of PMI, Ron Erdos. Plaintiff goes on to assert her belief that the Erdos in turn reported the incident to defendant Borden.
Plaintiff's statement under Local Civil Rule 3(g) alleges that defendant Borden knew or should have known that plaintiff was subjected to sexual harassment since at least April 1989. Borden's 3(g) statement asserts that he did not learn about plaintiff's complaint until 1990.
It should be noted that the presentations of all parties on the motion for summary judgment are based mainly on the extensive depositions taken in the case.
No deposition of Spivack or Erdos was taken. At least, there is no reference to such deposition testimony in the present motion. Borden's deposition was taken. Plaintiff's attorney asked Borden if he knew about a ""nonbusiness relationship"" between plaintiff and Urban, to which Borden replied that, when Urban recommended plaintiff for a promotion in late August 1989, Urban said that he and plaintiff had dated but that they were no longer dating. Borden testified that he learned nothing further until January 1990.
Thus there is no support in Borden's deposition or in any other evidence for the idea that Borden learned of the problem in April 1989. Plaintiff's proposition to this effect is entirely speculative.
After April 1989 sexual relations between plaintiff and Urban continued. On January 30, 1990 plaintiff met with Gertrude de la Osa, Director of Development Services at UDAR and complained about sexual harassment by Urban. The matter was promptly reported by de la Osa to Borden. An investigation was immediately conducted by Borden with the assistance of the Office of General Counsel of the University.
By early March Urban was relieved of any supervisory role with respect to plaintiff. In April 1990 Urban's resignation was requested and given. He left the University at that time. 
DISCUSSION
A sexual harassment claim under Title VII may be based on either of two theories: (1) ""quid pro quo"" or (2) hostile work environment. See Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64-65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404-2405, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986).
In order to prevail on a quid quo pro theory, the plaintiff must show an actual  rather than threatened  economic loss because of gender or because a sexual advance was made and rejected. Plaintiff produces no evidence demonstrating that she was denied an economic benefit. In fact, during the period of the alleged harassment, plaintiff was promoted from clerical worker to Project Director of Telefund. Her salary also increased. The court finds that there is no indication of any valid claim under the quid pro quo theory.
The allegations under the hostile environment theory must be dealt with in more detail. In the motion for summary judgment, Columbia does not attempt to disprove the allegations of misconduct against Urban. Columbia's position is that, even if Urban committed the misdeeds alleged, Columbia is not liable.
The Supreme Court has not established a definitive rule for employer liability, but has directed lower courts to draw from traditional agency principles. Vinson, 477 U.S.  at 72, 106 S. Ct.  at 2408. The Second Circuit has interpreted this guideline to mean that a plaintiff must prove ""that the employer either provided no reasonable avenue for complaint or knew of the harassment but did nothing about it."" Kotcher v. Rosa  Sullivan Appliance Center, Inc., 957 F.2d 59, 63 (2d Cir. 1992).
There is no basis for any contention that Columbia University failed to provide a reasonable avenue for making complaints. The only possible ground for holding Columbia liable is that it knew of the misconduct of Urban and failed to take remedial steps.
In this connection, plaintiff contends that Columbia knew of the sexual harassment in September 1988, at the time of her consultations with the Sexual Harassment Panel *417 and with the EOAA. Plaintiff contends that, despite this knowledge, Columbia did nothing about the problem. Plaintiff further contends that Columbia knew about the difficulty in April 1989 when she described it to Spivack of PMI. Plaintiff contends that again Columbia failed to perform its duty to take remedial action.
The information which certain Columbia employees learned in September 1988 was obtained in the course of consultations which were intended to be completely confidential. It cannot be said that this was ""knowledge"" on the part of Columbia of the kind that gave Columbia the duty to inquire and take remedial action. Plaintiff chose these confidential procedures instead of availing herself of the right, offered by the University, to file a grievance and initiate an investigation leading to a possible remedy against Urban. Columbia could hardly be expected to act against Urban as a result of the confidential consultations of September 1988.
In connection with plaintiff's claim that Columbia should have taken action in April 1989, the essential fact is that plaintiff spoke to an employee of a separate company, PMI, and did not speak to anyone at Columbia. Despite an extensive deposition record, there is absolutely no evidence that any PMI employee notified Borden or anyone else at Columbia of what plaintiff said.
Plaintiff contends that notice to PMI was the equivalent of notice to Columbia, and that PMI's knowledge should be taken to be the knowledge of Columbia. The court rejects this theory. PMI was a small company performing a service as an independent contractor to Columbia. It was not responsible for policing the problems arising between one Columbia University employee and another. If PMI had reported the matter, it would have involved going over Urban's head to someone such as Borden, and relaying a complaint about Urban. Perhaps this would have been a worthy thing to do, but PMI had no legal duty to do so, and indeed had economic reasons for minding its own business.
But overriding all of this is the salient fact that plaintiff had the ability in April 1989 or at any time to go directly to Columbia with her complaint. She did not have to rely on the uncertain, indirect channel of PMI. Under all the circumstances, the court rules that notice to PMI was not notice to Columbia and that PMI's knowledge was not the knowledge of Columbia. The events of April 1989 did not impose on Columbia any duty to take remedial action against Urban.
The first time that plaintiff made a complaint of such a nature as to require action on the part of Columbia was in late January 1990. When this occurred Columbia took prompt and effective remedial action. Within a reasonable time plaintiff was removed from Urban's supervision. Shortly thereafter Urban's employment was terminated.
The court rules that Columbia had no duty to investigate, or to take remedial action, until plaintiff made her complaint in late January 1990. Columbia's response to that complaint was prompt and effective. Columbia has demonstrated that it is not liable under Title VII and that there is no triable issue of fact on this claim.
Brief note must be made of a retaliation claim of plaintiff. It appears that plaintiff was terminated in August 1990 along with all other employees working on the Telefund operation. Plaintiff makes a conclusory, totally unsupported allegation that this was in retaliation for her sexual harassment complaint. Columbia has produced conclusive evidence that the Telefund program was cancelled for independent business reasons. The evaluation of the Telefund operation had been going on since the summer of 1989 and in the summer of 1990 a UDAR employee named Veronica Chappelle recommended that the Telefund operation be ended.
In late 1990 Columbia accepted the offer of a different company than PMI to make Columbia a demonstration site for computerized telephone fund raising. This project was developed at no cost to Columbia. Plaintiff admits that she reviewed certain *418 published public listings of job openings for this project, but did not apply. 
CONCLUSION
Columbia is entitled to summary judgment dismissing the Title VII claim.
The only basis for jurisdiction over the other claims against Columbia is the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. All the claims against Borden and Urban are before the court solely on the basis of pendent jurisdiction.
Since the Title VII claim against Columbia is dismissed, there is no basis for asserting jurisdiction over the remaining claims.
The action is dismissed in its entirety.
SO ORDERED.

http://nypost.com/2017/10/03/esteemed-columbia-professor-accused-of-sexually-harassing-student/,"
							An elderly professor who’s been teaching at Columbia University for more than 50 years preyed on a female doctoral student and sexually harassed her for two years, a new lawsuit alleges.
The now 29-year-old woman claims the harassment began when she was a graduate student in 2014, when William V. Harris, a celebrated history professor and longtime program director at the school, duped her into believing he was a trusted confidant, according to the Manhattan federal court complaint filed Monday.
After inviting the woman to work for him, the then 75-year-old educator began coming onto her — inappropriately groping and kissing her in his office while pressuring her to have sex with him, the suit alleged.
He also asked that she send him “sexually explicit emails.”
Harris, who specializes in ancient Greek and Roman history, allegedly told the woman that she was being “too emotional” when she complained about his unwanted passes.
Things turned sour after the anonymous woman withdrew from her work with Harris, as well as from Columbia, during the 2015-16 school year to seek counseling for her extreme “psychological distress.”
That’s when the geriatric professor began badmouthing her to other staffers and students, saying she dropped out without due cause.
The woman, who still teaches at the Ivy League school, said Columbia was well aware of Harris’ predatory behavior, which has been going on for “decades,” but that the school turned a “blind eye” to it.
She also claimed Harris targeted many other female students.
“When students have reported sexual harassment to Columbia’s administrators, officers, and employees …Columbia has shown deliberate indifference to their complaints,” the suit said.
In an email, Harris said he had no comment on the allegations.
“We treat any claim of harassment or other gender-based misconduct in our community with the utmost seriousness, but we do not comment in the press on allegations made in legal complaints,” Columbia said in a statement.
“Columbia pays lip service to the ideals of a safe campus,” said David Sanford, one of the woman’s lawyers. “However, the institution has demonstrated deliberate indifference to complaints of sexual harassment. Jane Doe is now among the women harmed by Columbia University trustees’ callous disregard for students’ safety, psychological health, and emotional well being.”

http://freebeacon.com/culture/second-columbia-professor-resigns-accusations-sexual-misconduct/,"
			Columbia University lost its second professor this week to accusations of sexual misconduct by former students, in a wave of investigations into sexual harassment by university officials and faculty at American campuses.	
	
Thomas Roma, director of Columbia's photography program since 1996, resigned effective immediately after five women came forward with allegations reported Wednesday in the New York Times. The university conducted internal investigations into the allegations when they were originally made over 15 years ago, and found in at least one case that both the alleged victim and Roma were responsible for the incident.
This comes after tenured history professor William Harris retired last month following accusations by an anonymous female graduate student that he had pursued nonconsensual sexual contact since 2012.
Meanwhile, Todd Heatherton abandoned his post as visiting scholar at New York University in November, when an investigation was opened into his alleged sexual misconduct as a psychology professor at Dartmouth College. He is among three Dartmouth faculty members who were placed on paid leave in October pending the results of inquiries into the claims.
Norman Pattiz, a long-time member of the University of California Board of Regents, announced last week that he would resign in mid-February, following sustained pressure over revelations in 2016 that he allegedly sexually harassed an employee at his radio company. UC students have since been demanding he step down, and called out UC President Janet Napolitano for her repeated statements about being devoted to combatting sexual misconduct—even setting up a ""student advisory board"" on the issue—while allowing Pattiz to remain.
At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 37 faculty and staff have been accused of sexual assault or harassment since 2013, according to a new report by the student paper, Media Milwaukee. Violations were found in 11 of those cases and two investigations are still pending, though it is unclear what action were taken by the administration when misconduct was discovered.
In a statement to a local new outlet, the university would only say ""appropriate discipline was taken"" when misconduct was found. ""Most of the employees were terminated or had already left the university,"" added the university.	
	
Media Milwaukee notes that the Office of Equity and Diversity Services, responsible for overseeing harassment reporting and investigations, has been ""extremely understaffed for about 10 years,"" and seen frequent turnover, with four different interim directors since 2011.
A part-time chemistry professor at George Washington University has charged administrators subjected her to an ""malicious"" Title IX investigation into alleged sexual harassment of a student, and filed a lawsuit against the university and staff late last year.

            Rhonda Simmons, , (540) 825-0771 ext. 125
        Germanna Community College placed its newly hired dean of arts and sciences on paid administrative leave Friday following a co-worker’s complaint alleging “improper conduct,” according to a source close to the investigation.
It’s the third such claim against Dr. John W. Francis in the past two years.
Francis, 46, was fired as deputy of the Ohio Department of Health Nov. 21, 2008, on allegations of sexual misconduct during his eight-month tenure at the health agency, according to the Associated Press.
In September 2007, he was accused of sexually harassing a female student at Columbus State (Ohio) Community College. An internal investigation found no wrongdoing but ordered Francis to attend sexual harassment awareness training and to meet female students in more public places.
GCC President David A. Sam said the school’s background check did not pick up on this element of Francis’ past. Francis began working at GCC July 1.

            Germanna spokesman Mike Zitz said he “could not confirm or deny” any claims against Francis.
“The college’s policy is not to comment on personnel matters to protect the privacy of employees,” Zitz said Monday. “We are not going to release details on the personnel matter. We cannot say how many complained or who they are. We are doing due diligence on any allegations or complaints and will not investigate through the press.”
The Virginia Community College System is monitoring the situation and providing advice and direction, Zitz added.
In an AP article Oct. 22, Francis denied any inappropriate behavior, stating that the accusations against him in Ohio were “fabricated by women whom he graded harshly, denied promotions or professionally disciplined.”
“Honest to God, it was a politically motivated complaint (at the Health Department). I never did anything that was in it,” Francis told the AP. “I went in there as a good person, in good faith, to do good work for the state of Ohio. This is what I got.”
Efforts to reach Francis and his attorney were unsuccessful Monday.
GCC would not comment on the length of Francis’ suspension and did not elaborate on the nature of its former employee’s complaint against him. The complaint, however, was not sexual in nature, the source said.
“Out of respect to the privacy of employees’ records,” Sam said, “we cannot discuss any personnel matter in public. “Should any actions result, details will be released only if it is legal and appropriate to do so.”
Francis has no direct ties to Germanna’s Culpeper campus, as his main duties are conducted out of Fredericksburg.
At Germanna, Francis works with faculty members and does not have direct contact with students. He makes $83,000 a year.

COLUMBUS, Ga. — A spokesperson from Columbus State University says an assistant professor has resigned after he was accused of sexually harassing one of his female students.



University spokesman John Lester says the school has dropped the case against Dr. Kyle Christensen following his resignation. The young woman’s father filed the sexual harassment report with CSU police back in December.



“We’ve been in constant contact with the young woman involved in this incident. Obliviously that is one of our primary concerns and we will contact her again now that there’s some additional attention coming out of this,” Lester says when asked about the alleged victim. “She’s known what’s happened along every step of the way”





News 3 first reported this incident on March 9. It was the following day that Christensen was placed on administrative leave.

 JAMES MAAS,  APPELLANT,   v.  CORNELL UNIVERSITY,  RESPONDENT.
94 N.Y.2d 87 (1999).
  November 23, 1999 
3 No. 179
 [99  NY Int. 0157]
Decided November 23, 1999
 

 This opinion is uncorrected and subject to revision before publication in the New York Reports. David A. Stoll, for appellant. Nelson E. Roth, for respondent.
BELLACOSA,  J.:





 The overriding issue on this appeal is whether 
plaintiff, Professor James Maas, may assert a plenary breach ofcontract action against defendant Cornell University, his 
employer.  The lawsuit is premised on the University's alleged 
failure to follow the procedures it had promulgated and used for 
the resolution of sexual harassment claims brought by four 
students against their teacher, Maas.  We agree with the courts 
below that the action does not lie, and that Maas is not 
otherwise entitled to any judicial relief ( see also,  Matter of 
Stoll v Cornell University, ___ NY2d ___ [decided today]).



I.



 Maas is a tenured psychology professor in Cornell 
University's College of Arts and Sciences.  In 1994, four 
students filed sexual harassment accusations against him.  The 
complaints were processed and reviewed under internal, 
departmental University protocols, prescribed and approved in 
1991 by the College of Arts and Sciences Faculty; the ordinances 
were entitled ""Procedures to Handle Accusations of Sexual 
Harassment against Faculty Members of Cornell University's 
College of Arts and Sciences.""



 Following an investigative finding of merit by the 
College's Senior Sexual Harassment Counselor, the Professional 
Ethics Committee held five days of hearings.  It then found 
unanimously that Maas had repeatedly behaved unprofessionally and 
inappropriately in his relationships with the complainants, and 
that his behavior constituted sexual harassment.  The Committee 
recommendations included conditions on this professor's conductin relation to students, and consideration for a fiveyear period 
of the finding of sexual harassment in determining any pay 
increases, promotions, honors and assignments.  The Dean of the 
College upheld the Committee's determination.  An administrative 
appeal by Maas to the Provost was rejected; he remains a tenured 
member of the College Faculty.  



 Maas then sued Cornell, alleging eight causes of 
action, including unlawful adoption of procedures, breach of 
contract for failure to observe bylaws and procedures, and 
negligence.  The University moved to dismiss all causes of action 
and, alternatively, to convert the action into a CPLR article 78 
review proceeding.  Maas opposed the procedural conversion and 
maintained that he had viable grounds to pursue the breach of 
contract action.  



 Supreme Court granted Cornell's motion.  It dismissed 
all but the two negligence causes of action.  The court stated 
that none of the allegations in the complaint specifies the terms 
of the asserted contract between Maas and Cornell which Maas 
claims were violated.  The court also refused to convert the 
action to a CPLR article 78 proceeding.  The Appellate Division 
unanimously affirmed.  It concluded that, liberally construing 
the complaint, the pleading fails to allege a specific agreement 
that the University purportedly breached.  The court was 
unpersuaded that the procedures contained in the University's 
Campus Code and the College's regulations evolved into terms ofan implied contract between Maas and the University.  The 
Appellate Division did not address Maas' request for Article 78 
conversion at that stage of the litigation.  Upon remittal, when 
the remaining portions of the case were again before Supreme 
Court, it granted Cornell's successor summary judgment motion 
with respect to the remaining negligence causes of action.  By 
dismissing these claims, Supreme Court put the entire matter out 
of court.



 On a second appeal by Maas, the Appellate Division 
again unanimously affirmed.  With respect to his turnabout 
argument for procedural conversion of the action into a CPLR 
article 78 proceeding, the court concluded that Maas ""[h]aving 
obviously made a tactical decision to pursue his eight causes of 
action in a plenary action and having succeeded on his prior 
objection to conversion, [he] may not now, owing to changed 
interests since all claims in this action have been dismissed * * 
* assume a contrary position"" (253 AD2d 1, 5 [citations 
omitted]).  This Court granted Maas leave to appeal, and we now 
affirm in all respects.



II.   



 The principal substantive thrust by Maas is that the 
University's regulations and procedures create a contractual 
relationship with him.  He theorizes, therefore, that any alleged 
violation of these procedures may form the basis for his breach 
of contract action against the University.  He is wrong.  



 In preliminarily assessing this controversy, the facts 
pleaded in the complaint must be taken as true and are accorded 
every favorable inference  only for purposes of deciding this 
procedural staging of the controversy ( see,  e.g.,  219 Broadway 
Corp. v Alexander's Inc., 46 NY2d 506, 509).  However, 
""allegations consisting of bare legal conclusions as well as 
factual claims flatly contradicted by documentary evidence are 
not entitled to any such consideration,"" nor to that arguendo 
advantage ( Gertler v Goodgold, 107 AD2d 481, 485  affd for the 
reasons stated below 66 NY2d 946).



A.



 The complaint by Maas premises his contract action on 
the view that Cornell breached his contractual rights as a 
tenured professor.  Without reference to any express contractual 
source, Maas contends that the University's administrative 
procedures form the basis for implying an agreement between them, 
which Cornell breached by failing to follow its own procedures.  
In assessing this employment relationship between the academic 
institution and its faculty member, we are satisfied that the 
University's adherence to its own internal procedures does not 
qualify for judicial cognizance.



 This Court's case law reflects the policy that the 
administrative decisions of educational institutions involve the 
exercise of highly specialized professional judgment and these 
institutions are, for the most part, better suited to makerelatively final decisions concerning wholly internal matters 
( see,  e.g.,  Matter of Olsson v Board of Higher Educ. of the City 
of N.Y., 49 NY2d 408, 413 [cautioning that courts should 
""exercise[ ] the utmost restraint in applying traditional legal 
rules to disputes within the academic community""]).  This 
jurisprudential guidepost stems from the belief that these 
institutions are ""peculiarly capable of making the decisions 
which are appropriate and necessary to their continued existence"" 
( Gertler v Goodgold, 107 AD2d 481, 485  affd for the reasons 
stated below 66 NY2d 946,  supra).  



 Courts retain a ""restricted role"" in dealing with and 
reviewing controversies involving colleges and universities 
( Gertler v Goodgold,  supra, at 487;  see also,  Klinge v Ithaca 
Coll., 244 AD2d 611, 613).  ""In these socalled 'university' 
cases, CPLR article 78 proceedings are the appropriate vehicle 
because they ensure that the overall integrity of the 
educational institution is maintained and, therefore, protect 
more than just the individual's right to employment"" ( Klinge v 
Ithaca Coll.,  supra, at 613).  Thus, a CPLR article 78 proceeding 
is the route for judicial review of such matters, not a plenary 
action.  Notably, when litigants fail to avail themselves of the 
CPLR article 78 avenue, courts may justifiably dismiss plenary 
claims premised upon alleged failures to follow applicable 
principles set forth in employee handbooks ( see,  Holm v Ithaca 
Coll., 256 AD2d 986, 988,  lv  denied 93 NY2d 804). 



 Maas may have been entitled to CPLR article 78 review.  
Ironically, he initially resisted that very relief sought by 
defendant Cornell in the trial court.  In his latest twist, he 
asserts that the lower courts erred in refusing to convert his 
plenary action into a CPLR article 78 proceeding.  His effort in 
this regard comes too late and the relief is now unavailable for 
the reasons given by the Appellate Division, and as noted above 
in the litigation description of this case ( see, 253 AD2d 1;  see 
 also,  Matter of Martin v C.A. Prods. Co., 8 NY2d 226, 231).  



B. Because we agree that Maas cannot now seek to convert 
his action to a CPLR article 78 review proceeding, we must 
address his strained effort to avoid dismissal of his breach of 
contract action.  To the extent his arguments may be construed as 
urging that an impliedinfact agreement may be extracted out of 
the procedures contained in the Campus Code, as well as in the 
College of Arts and Sciences regulations, his theory fails.



 Instructively, this Court affirmed the dismissal of a 
complaint which alleged a breach of contract action based on a 
university's unfair administrative conduct ( see,  Gertler v 
Goodgold, 107 AD2d 481,  affd for the reasons stated below 66 NY2d 946,  supra).  When a complaint which merely ""recites a litany of 
academic and administrative grievances couched in terms of a 
violation of a contractual right to tenure"" and is devoid of any 
reference to the contractual basis for the rights asserted,academic prerogatives should not be channeled into a cognizable 
contract action classification ( id. at 484).  



 Moreover, Cornell cannot be held to have contractually 
bound itself to follow these internal rules when it hired Maas.  
In the analogous context of wrongful termination disputes, this 
Court has held that an employee's action against an employer 
based on its written policies may not be maintained unless the 
employer ""made the employee aware of its express written policy * 
* * and that employee detrimentally relied on that policy in 
accepting the employment"" ( DePetris v Union Settlement Assoc., 86 NY2d 406, 410;  see also,  Weiner v McGrawHill, Inc., 57 NY2d 458, 
464466).  None of these prerequisites is present or operative in 
the relationship at issue in this case.



 We discern additional support in Restatement [Second] 
of Contracts § 4.  It provides that ""[a] promise may be stated in 
words either oral or written, or may be inferred wholly or partly 
from conduct.""  An impliedinfact contract would arise from a 
mutual agreement and an ""intent to promise, when the agreement 
and promise have simply not been expressed in words"" (1 
Williston, Contracts, § 1:5, at 20 [4th ed 1990]).  This type of 
contract still requires such elements as consideration, mutual 
assent, legal capacity and legal subject matter ( id. at 22).  A 
""[m]anifestation of mutual assent to an exchange requires that 
each party either make a promise or begin or render a 
performance"" (Restatement [Second] Contracts § 18).  The conductof a party may manifest assent if the party intends to engage in 
such conduct and knows that such conduct gives rise to an 
inference of assent ( id. at § 19).  Thus, a promise may be 
implied when a court may justifiably infer that the promise would 
have been explicitly made, had attention been drawn to it ( see, 
 Genet v President of Delaware  Hudson Canal Co., 136 NY 593, 
609).  While handbooks generally contain information concerning 
rights and responsibilities, ""the concept of handbooks as part of 
a contract with commitments and expectations on both sides"" is 
not universally accepted (Mawdsley,  Litigation Involving Higher 
Education Employee and Student Handbooks, 109 Educ. Law Rep. 
1031, 1049).  Thus, under these guidelines, we are not persuaded 
that any basis has been presented to support an attributed assent 
to the University that the Campus Code was to be deemed a part of 
the employment contract with Maas.



 With this backdrop, Maas has failed to plead a 
cognizable breach of contract action. The University nowhere 
reflected an intent that the provisions of its Code would become 
terms of a discrete, impliedinfact agreement, for purposes such 
as are alleged in this lawsuit.  The Code itself is heavily 
informational in nature and does not express or support the 
implication of any promise on the part of the University.  While 
the Code and its attendant regulations promulgate the 
University's sexual harassment policy and provide procedures for 
dealing with sexual harassment claims, Maas' essential employmentduties and rights are only indirectly affected by these 
provisions.  Finally, in this regard, Cornell's handbook clearly 
states that it can be altered at any time (impliedly 
unilaterally), and cautions readers and affected persons to seek 
out the most updated edition.  That feature is hardly the 
harbinger of a legally binding set of arrangements.  We conclude, 
therefore, that there is no support in this record or in relevant 
authority sources to sustain Maas' implied contract cause.



 Maas also relies on  Tedeschi v Wagner College (49 NY2d 652) to support his theory.  He misconstrues that ruling, as it 
might even possibly apply here.  



 In the context of the relationship between a university 
and a student, this Court in  Tedeschi held that ""when a 
university has adopted a rule or guideline establishing the 
procedure to be followed in relation to suspension or expulsion 
that procedure must be substantially observed"" ( id. at 660).  We 
explicitly cautioned that the legal theory upon which this rule 
emerges is, however, not well defined, and that the ""[c]ontract 
theory is not wholly satisfactory"" ( id. at 658, 659660).  
Further, we concluded that ""[s]o much of the complaint as sought 
money damages and the right to a due process hearing based on 
claimed 'state action' was properly dismissed"" ( id. at 661662).   
Therefore,  Tedeschi provides no support for Maas's claim under 
the alleged breach of contract theory.  



 The Court has considered all other arguments, and 
concludes that they are likewise without merit.  This case was 
correctly decided by both courts below, and we affirm.



 Accordingly, the order of the Appellate Division should 
be affirmed, with costs.    



Order affirmed, with costs.  Opinion by Judge Bellacosa.  Chief 
Judge Kaye and Judges Smith, Levine, Ciparick and Rosenblatt 
concur.  Judge Wesley took no part.

OMAHA - The Nebraska Supreme Court declined on Friday to reopen
a dispute about whether e-mails that two Spanish professors at
Creighton University exchanged in Spanish translate into proof of
sexual harassment.
The court ruled that someone who commits sexual harassment
shouldn't be able to later sue the victim when the original
harassment complaint was justified. The court said there weren't
enough substantial questions about the complaint that Michelle
Evers filed against Roxana Recio to allow Recio's lawsuit to
proceed.
Recio's lawsuit claimed the harassment complaint was politically
motivated and related to discord in the modern languages
department. The suit noted that Evers' complaint was filed with the
school in 2004 - three years after the e-mails were exchanged.
""We are convinced that the system was being manipulated for
political purposes that didn't have anything to do with sexual
harassment,"" Recio's attorney, Kevin McCoy, said Friday. He said
Recio, on sabbatical in Spain, was disappointed.

            Evers' attorney, Thomas Hoarty, said he and his client ""were
very pleased"" with the court decision. Evers has since moved to
California.
Evers' complaint centered on a handful of e-mails in Spanish
that Recio sent to her in 2001. In several, Recio wrote about how
she would miss Evers while she traveled in Spain.
Recio said Evers' translation of the e-mails misrepresented
their meaning. Recio is a native Spanish speaker and Cuban exile
who grew up in Spain, while Evers was raised in Nebraska and
learned Spanish as a second language.
Creighton officials sanctioned Recio in 2004, placed her on
probation and ordered her to pay for counseling. Her lawsuit said
the incident harmed her standing at the university and her actions
shouldn't have been considered harassment.
The court quoted several e-mails Recio sent to Evers, including
one that Evers translated as: ""You don't understand because you see
me like some nice person who tortures you with e-mails and who you
will work with, you are kind, polite, etc. but for me it is
different, Michelle, I feel so much for you, don't you notice?""
Recio said the phrase, ""I feel so much for you,"" should have
been translated as ""I have developed some affection for you.""
In another e-mail, Evers translated wording to ""when I really
like someone."" Recio said it meant ""when I am impressed by
someone.""
McCoy said Evers selected eight of Recio's e-mails out of
context, and that Evers' e-mails were similar in tone. He said
Recio's messages might be considered ""effusive or at times
melodramatic,"" but in no way threatening or sexually harassing.

                The New Hampshire Board of Medicine last month suspended the medical license of Hanover psychiatrist and former Dartmouth Medical School professor Michael Gaylor for one year as a result of Gaylor's sexual involvement with a student.
The Board concluded Gaylor had been involved in a sexual relationship with a female student at the medical school while he was a professor there.
                                This was an unusual decision by the Board because it involved a professor-student relationship rather than a doctor-patient relationship.
                                
                                According to the report issued by the Board of Medicine, Gaylor ""engaged in professional misconduct between September 1984 and September 1991"" in his roles as a psychiatrist and faculty advisor at the medical school.
During his time as a professor at DMS, Gaylor also had an office at Dick's House and served as the Director of the Office of Counseling and Human Development, according to the report.
The female medical student met with Gaylor four times during her first year at the medical school at his office in Dick's House, according to the report, in order to discuss ""stress management issues for personal, mental health reasons.""
                Over the next three years, 1984 to 1986, the student met with Gaylor 22 times and discussed a variety of issues in sessions that ""went well beyond the scope of ordinary 'academic counseling,'"" the report stated.
                                The Board of Medicine concluded that the content of those sessions involved ""substantial elements of 'psychological' or 'mental health' counseling that is typically used by licensed psychiatrists and thus put Gaylor and the student in the roles of physician and patient, according to the report.
During the counseling sessions a ""dual relationship and eroticized transference issues"" developed and a sexual relationship between the two parties commenced approximately eight weeks after the last counseling session, the report stated.
The sexual relationship between Gaylor and the student lasted from 1986 until 1991.
Gaylor resigned from the medical school in 1994 and had a private practice in Hanover afterward.
Gaylor's attorney declined to comment on the status of Gaylor's case. The female medical student's attorney was unavailable for comment on the ruling.
Associate Director of Public Affairs Roland Adams said the College had no offical opinion on the ruling.

Psychological and brain sciences professor Todd Heatherton has elected to retire immediately following a recommendation from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Elizabeth Smith, upheld by the faculty-elected Review Committee, that his tenure be revoked and his employment terminated. Smith's recommendation follows a review of Heatherton by an external investigator for sexual misconduct. Professors Bill Kelley and Paul Whalen of the PBS department, who are also under investigation for sexual misconduct, remain under review.
                                In a press release provided by his lawyer Julie Moore, Heatherton stated that he retired because he thought it was best for his family, the College and the graduate students involved in the investigation. Multiple students in the PBS department have previously spoken to The Dartmouth alleging sexual misconduct on the part of Heatherton, Kelley and Whalen.
                                
                                ""I acknowledge that I acted unprofessionally in public at conferences while intoxicated,"" Heatherton wrote. ""I offer a humble and sincere apology to anyone affected by my actions.” 
Heatherton, Kelley and Whalen have been under review since last fall. Per an email sent to all of campus by College President Phil Hanlon, Smith has also made recommendations for Kelley and Whalen that have been upheld by the Review Committee.
Kelley and Whalen will remain on paid leave until Dean Smith’s recommendations are reviewed by the Dartmouth-wide Council on Academic Freedom and Responsibility, an 18-member council elected by the faculty. Heatherton, who was eligible to retire based on his age and length of service, chose to do so prior to CAFR review. After the reviews are completed, Hanlon will deliver the CAFR report, as well as full transcripts of any hearings, to the College’s Board of Trustees, who will make a final decision on each case. According to an email from College spokesperson Diana Lawrence, none of the external investigator’s reports or information from the CAFR will be made public for any of the professors.
                Hanlon’s email did not disclose Smith or the Review Committee’s recommendations for Kelley and Whalen “out of respect for the ongoing process.” Lawrence wrote that she cannot speculate on the timeframe for the CAFR and the Board to reach a decision.
                                The three professors have also been under criminal investigation by the New Hampshire attorney general’s office since last October. Senior assistant attorney general Geoffrey W.R. Ward wrote in an email that the attorney general's office remains ongoing. Hanlon's email notes that the College is continuing to cooperate with law enforcement on their separate investigation.
Heatherton remains barred from entering campus property or attending College events. He will also not be granted emeritus status, according to Lawrence. Kelley and Whalen are also restricted from entering College property.
In addition to his vested retirement funds, Heatherton is eligible to receive retiree health coverage from the College. Lawrence wrote that employees who have reached the age of 55 and have at least 10 years of continuous service are eligible for some retiree health benefits, regardless of their reason for leaving the College. Dartmouth does not have the power to prevent a retirement or disallow health benefits for retirees, Lawrence wrote.
The Dartmouth first reported on Oct. 25, 2017 that the three PBS professors were on paid leave and under investigation for misconduct. On Oct. 31, Hanlon wrote a campus-wide email confirming that the professors were “alleged to have engaged in sexual misconduct and are being investigated by law enforcement,” including the New Hampshire attorney general’s office, the Grafton County attorney, the New Hampshire State Police, the Grafton County Sheriff’s office and Hanover Police. On Nov. 10, the College announced that it had hired an external investigator to conduct its own investigations of the allegations. 
On Nov. 18, The Dartmouth reported that fifteen undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and scholars in the PBS department signed a statement to The Dartmouth alleging that the three professors created a “hostile academic environment in which sexual harassment is normalized.” They further claimed that the professors had violated one or more of the College’s Employee Sexual Misconduct Policy, Employee Sexual Harassment Policy and Policy on Instructor-Student Consensual Relationships. Four of those signees spoke directly to The Dartmouth about their experiences, and three more provided written statements about their time in the PBS department.
On Feb. 19, 2018, Hanlon announced that the external investigator was “close to concluding her work,” and that, after the completion of investigations, disciplinary action following procedures in the Organization of the Faculty of Dartmouth College would be pursued.

                Psychological and brain sciences professor Paul Whalen has resigned from the College effective immediately following an investigation into his behavior for allegations of sexual misconduct by a College-appointed external investigator. Professor Bill Kelley of the PBS department, who was also investigated for sexual misconduct, remains under review.
Whalen’s resignation follows a recommendation from Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences Elizabeth Smith that his tenure be revoked and his employment terminated. Smith’s decision was upheld by the faculty-elected Review Committee. At the time of his resignation, Smith’s recommendations for Whalen were being reviewed by the Dartmouth-wide Council on Academic Freedom and Responsibility, an 18-member council elected by the faculty. Kelley has also received a recommendation from Smith, as of yet undisclosed, that was upheld by the Review Committee, and is currently undergoing CAFR review.
                                Earlier this month, PBS professor Todd Heatherton, who was also investigated for sexual misconduct, chose to retire after Smith recommended and the Review Committee upheld that his employment be terminated. According to an email statement from College spokesperson Diana Lawrence, Whalen was not yet eligible for retirement, which requires that the retiree be at least 55 and have served at Dartmouth for at least 10 years. While Heatherton will receive his vested retirement funds and retiree health coverage from the College, Whalen is not eligible for retiree health benefits.
                                
                                Whalen remains barred from entering campus property or attending College events following his resignation, as does Heatherton following his retirement. Kelley is also restricted from entering College property.
Kelley will remain on paid leave until the CAFR reviews Smith’s recommendations, after which College President Phil Hanlon will deliver the CAFR report, as well as full transcripts of any relevant hearings, to the College’s Board of Trustees. The board is responsible for making a final decision on Kelley’s case. After Heatherton’s decision to retire, Lawrence wrote in a statement to The Dartmouth that none of the external investigator’s reports or information from the CAFR will be made public for any of the professors.
The New Hampshire attorney general’s office has been conducting a criminal investigation of the three professors since last October. A campus-wide email from Hanlon announcing Whalen’s resignation stated that the College is continuing to cooperate with law enforcement for their investigations. The Dartmouth left a voicemail with the attorney general’s office asking whether there have been any updates in the criminal investigations.
                As of press time, Whalen had not responded to requests for comment. Lawrence previously told The Dartmouth she believed he was represented by the firm of Good Schneider Cormier  Fried. An employee of the firm told The Dartmouth over the phone that she could neither confirm nor deny that the firm represented Whalen.
                                The Dartmouth first reported on Oct. 25, 2017 that the three PBS professors were under investigation for misconduct and on paid leave. On Oct. 31, Hanlon wrote a campus-wide email explaining that the three professors were “alleged to have engaged in sexual misconduct and are being investigated by law enforcement,” including the New Hampshire attorney general’s office, the Grafton County attorney, the New Hampshire State Police, the Grafton County Sheriff’s office and Hanover Police. On Nov. 10, the College announced that it had hired an external investigator look into the allegations.
On Nov. 18, The Dartmouth reported that 15 undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral students and scholars in the PBS department signed a statement to The Dartmouth alleging that the three professors created a “hostile academic environment in which sexual harassment is normalized.” In addition, the student claimed that the professors had violated one or more of the College’s Employee Sexual Misconduct Policy, Employee Sexual Harassment Policy and Policy on Instructor-Student Consensual Relationships. Four of those signees spoke directly to The Dartmouth about their experiences, and three more provided written statements about their time in the PBS department.
On Feb. 19, 2018, Hanlon announced that the external investigator was “close to concluding her work,” and that, after the investigations were completed, disciplinary action following procedures in the Organization of the Faculty of Dartmouth College would be pursued.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/09/investigation_found_professor.html,"Delta College.jpgDelta College( )BAY CITY, MI -- After two female students accused a professor of making inappropriate sexual advances toward them, Delta College's own investigation concluded it was likely the instructor indeed harassed them.Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff on July 12 filed the lawsuit on behalf of Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski in Bay County Circuit Court. Named as defendants in the suit are Delta College and former Professor Jonathan Brent Fonville.Mason and Jablonski are seeking damages in excess of $25,000, claiming they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they allege.Via a Freedom of Information Act request, The Times obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta College. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22 and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16.Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, the suit and the summary state.Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says.One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department.Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states.Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter.Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore.""In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues.The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high.""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville).""Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report.Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college.Fonville resigned from Delta Collegeo n Nov. 24, before Brown completed the investigation.Mason and Jablonski's suit asserts they are owed damages under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. The act prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status"" in employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations.In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denies any wrongdoing. The school denies ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff.""Attorney Lenhoff, representing the plaintiffs, has said this response doesn't jibe with Brown's findings.""This is inconsistent with the investigative report of Delta's Title IX coordinator,"" Lenhoff previously told The Times. ""Delta itself found the credibility of Emily and MaCayla to be high. It found Fonville's credibility was low. Delta found that there was sexual harassment here. I'm surprised at the answer and the answer's allegation is not so.""Professors and teachers must understand affairs with students and sexual advances on students are just completely inappropriate,"" he continued. ""This case really touches on a major national issue.""Fonville is represented by attorney Anne McClorey McLaughlin of Farmington Hills-based Johnson, Rosati, Schultz  Joppich.""My client denies that any communication he had with the plaintiffs had any impact on their studies at Delta College,"" McLaughlin said. ""It occurred outside of the time he was their instructor.""Fonville currently lives in Tennessee and was served with the suit there, Lenhoff said.The case is slated for a settlement conference before Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Tuesday, June 13, 2017."
http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2017/06/delta_college_settles_sexual_h.html,"BAY CITY, MI -- Two female students who alleged a Delta College professor sexually harassed them have dropped their lawsuit against the institution in exchange for a six-figure sum.On Feb. 7, Bay County Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran signed a stipulated order for dismissal in the suit filed by Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski against Delta College and former professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Sheeran dismissed the suit as it had been settled out of court.The settlement agreement, obtained by The Bay City Times-MLive via a Freedom of Information Act request, states Mason and Jablonski will receive $195,000 between them in exchange for releasing Delta and Fonville from all claims they have made against them.The sum is paid by the Michigan Community College Risk Management Authority, Delta's insurance provider.Despite settling, Delta and Fonville assert they are innocent of the plaintiffs' allegations.""The College and Fonville do not admit, and in fact deny any liability or wrongdoing by entering into this Agreement and enter into this Agreement solely for economic business reasons and to buy their peace,"" the settlement states.Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff filed the suit on the women's behalf in July 2016. In it, Jablonski and Mason claimed they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they alleged.Via another Freedom of Information Act request, MLive obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22, 2015, and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16.Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance.""The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material.

The Danforth Center takes very seriously, and investigates, all allegations of this nature that come to its attention. In keeping with its commitment, the Danforth Center initiated an internal investigation in May 2018 upon receiving a complaint of inappropriate conduct and comments of a sexual nature by Dr. Thomas Brutnell. The Danforth Center placed Dr. Brutnell on a leave of absence pending its investigation and has ended its relationship with Dr. Brutnell. As a research institution, the Danforth Center depends on mentoring and guidance from its leadership, faculty, and supervisors. As described in detail in the recent National Academies report, “Sexual Harassment of Women: Climate, Culture and Consequences in Academic Sciences, Engineering and Medicine,” leaders of scientific teams have power over the careers or livelihoods of scientific trainees and employees. The Danforth Center is determined to maintain a culture where all individuals in positions of power promote a safe, inclusive, discrimination- and harassment-free, and supportive workplace. To this end, the Danforth Center affirms that, regardless of position or influence, sexual harassment or other inappropriate behaviors that may result in a hostile work environment will not be tolerated. The Danforth Center further expects everyone to maintain the highest standards of ethical conduct. The success of our scientists and staff depends on how well we maintain that environment, and how well we support each other. James C. Carrington

https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/education/2018/04/26/drake-university-professor-sexual-misconduct-resigns/551913002/,"© Copyright 2018, Des Moines Register and Tribune Co.A Drake University professor has been allowed to resign effective June 1 after an internal investigation last fall found that he spanked female students and had them sit on his lap, the Des Moines Register has learned.Mahmoud Hamad, an associate professor in Drake’s political science department, is currently on a leave of absence and “has no teaching or academic responsibilities” at the university, said Sue Mattison, Drake’s provost.Hamad, 42, has not taught at Drake since 2016 and was on a sabbatical during 2017, a university spokesman said.Mattison declined to say whether Hamad was asked to resign. She also declined to say whether Hamad is being paid while on leave, which began when his sabbatical ended.An investigation into Hamad’s conduct found that he “physically, sexually and verbally intimidated” female students and “did exploit the power differential that existed between him and his female students,” according to a completed report dated Nov. 8, 2017.More:Drake's failure to fire professor who spanked students is an act of cowardiceHamad’s behavior violated Drake’s sexual and misconduct policy and its consensual relationships policy, according to the report. Drake never referred the case to Des Moines police.Nickey Jafari, 24, a 2014 Drake graduate who notified university officials about Hamad's conduct, criticized their handling of the matter.“Allowing (Hamad) to resign is unfair to any survivors,” she said. Jafari filed a complaint about Hamad, who was her adviser, with Drake in May 2017.“Letting him resign instead of firing him is not as clear of a statement from Drake that ‘This happened and we don’t condone or support it,’ "" Jafari said. ""I’m disappointed.""Hamad, reached at his Des Moines-area home, declined to comment, citing the advice of his attorney.In the report, Hamad denied the accusations made by Jafari and other students.#MeToo spurs resignations for sexual misconductInformation about the Drake investigation and Hamad’s resignation comes during a wave of reviews into sexual misconduct by university faculty and officials on campuses across the country.Since the #MeToo movement began last October, numerous professors have been fired or forced to resign over sexual misconduct accusations. The hashtag spread on social media as victims and others used it to show the prevalence of sexual assaults and harassment.In recent months, two professors at Columbia University in New York City resigned after accusations of sexual misconduct surfaced.At Dartmouth College, three faculty members were placed on leave pending the investigation of sexual misconduct allegations.The most prominent cases have been at Michigan State University, where the doctor for the school’s women’s gymnastics team and the U.S. women’s Olympic gymnastics team abused 200 young girls and women over more than two decades.More:Student criticizes Mount Mercy for closing her sexual assault case. Police are still investigating.Jafari said she decided to speak out about her treatment by Hamad after three-time Olympic gold medal winner Aly Raisman reported abuse by Larry Nassar, who is serving multiple prison sentences.Last year, Jafari posted information about Hamad’s conduct on social media.""I am writing this because I know what it feels like to be powerless, to feel vulnerable, and small, and absolutely petrified in that situation,"" Jafari wrote.The Register wrote about Jafari’s post and asked for a response from Drake officials.In a Dec. 1 written statement, Drake officials wrote that the university was “aware of the claims” made by Jafari. Officials wrote that “because the process has not yet concluded, no further comment can be provided.”Drake is a private Des Moines-based university that was founded in 1881 and has about 5,000 students. The university is internationally acclaimed for the Drake Relays, an annual track and field event being held this week that attracts world-class athletes.Jafari, Hamad went on student trip to EgyptJafari, who began attending Drake in August 2010, met Hamad in the summer of 2011 when she was part of a student group that visited Egypt. Hamad led the group and was the instructor for the honors courses related to the trip.In the fall of 2011, Hamad, a tenured professor, became one of Jafari’s academic advisers.In the report, Jafari told investigators that Hamad asked her to sit on his lap and she complied twice. She told investigators that the professor put his arms around her and that his face was close to her neck.Hamad also asked Jafari to call him “Dad.”In addition, Hamad told her that he would take her to Egypt for free if she got a 4.0 grade-point average, according to the report.“I decided to come forward because I knew I wasn’t the only one this happened to, and I didn’t want him to be able to move from school to school,” Jafari told the Register during a phone interview Thursday.The report also stated that another Drake student had an “emotional and physical relationship” with Hamad. That student didn’t report the misconduct because she was “worried about repercussions,” the report said.Drake won't say why it didn't fire HamadInvestigators found that Jafari and others who were interviewed were “credible,” the report said. In addition, investigators found Hamad’s denials “not credible.”The report found that Hamad violated university policies through “unwelcome advances and unwelcome verbal and physical conduct and intimidation aimed at female students because of their sex.”Hamad made “submission to his conduct an implicit or explicit requirement for academic success, recommendations, and networking contacts,” the report said.In a statement issued to the Register on Thursday, a Drake spokesman wrote that the university “is committed to the safety and well-being of all students, and especially those who have the courage to come forward with a complaint. We take such allegations seriously and have strong policies in place under Title IX that have been followed.“We are confident in the outcome of the investigation that resulted from the complaint made in this case.”Drake’s sexual and interpersonal misconduct policy states that sanctions for employees who violate the policy “could range from counseling to termination from employment.”Drake officials declined to say why Hamad was allowed to resign rather than be fired.Jafari, who is studying medicine, said Hamad should have been fired once the investigation was completed.“Any university who cares about its students would have a zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct,"" she said. ""If letting someone found guilty (of sexual misconduct) is the norm, then we need to change that standard.”Reporter Stephen Gruber-Miller contributed to this story."

This article is part of the DrexelNow ""Faces of Drexel"" series honoring Drexel's history as part of the Universitywide celebration of the 125th anniversary of Drexel's founding in 1891.
You already know that President John A. Fry is the current president of Drexel University, but who was the first Drexel president? Who served the longest amount of time as president — and the shortest? Read on to find out as DrexelNow honors the Drexel presidents who have shaped the University in 125 years. 
James A. MacAlister served as the inaugural president of the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry. The Scotland native, who previously served as the first superintendent of Philadelphia’s public school district, was chosen because of his strong advocation of practical training. During his presidency, Drexel expanded from a graduating class of 70 students in 1892 to 500 graduates in 1913, the year in which MacAlister resigned in ill health and died six months later. He served for 22 years — the longest tenure ever for a Drexel president. MacAlister Hall was named after him in 1973.
Though not considered an official president, Horace Churchman, a member of Drexel’s board of trustees, served as president in the interim.  
Hollis Godfrey became the next president in 1913. He consolidated the institute’s original independent departments into four schools. His legacy includes Drexel’s contributions to the World War I effort, the creation of the co-op program in 1919 and making Drexel a degree-granting institution. Godfrey resigned in 1921 to become chairman of the Council of Management Education and president of the Engineering-Economics Foundation, later falling ill and dying in 1936. 
Kenneth G. Matheson became Drexel’s president in 1921. His legacy includes reorganizing the administrative and faculty structure of the institute; increasing student organizations and outreach; expanding the co-op program; wiping out Drexel’s deficit; increasing the institute’s endowment to $1 million and expanding the size and quality of campus. Matheson was granted a leave of absence in May 1931 for his ill health, but he postponed the leave and died of a heart attack six months later. Matheson Hall, which was on campus from 1965 until 2011, was named after him. 
Drexel’s Board of Trustees then created an interim committee of deans, chaired by Academic Dean Robert Disque, to lead until the next president was hired. 
Parke R. Kolbe started in 1932 after serving as president of the University of Akron and the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn. Kolbe decentralized Drexel's administration and developed educational programs to support national defense as the threat of World War II loomed. Under his tenure, the Drexel Institute of Art, Science and Industry became the Drexel Institute of Technology in 1936. Kolbe died suddenly from heart disease in 1942 at age 60.
Disque, then the dean of faculty, headed another interim executive committee after President Kolbe died.
George Peters Rea became the next president in 1942 after serving as the first paid president of the American Stock Exchange. He was hired for his business acumen, since the institute was suffering from financial and enrollment hardships as a result of World War II. However, Rea was criticized for his laid-back style and habit of making decisions without the approval of the faculty senate or Drexel community, such as the controversial selling of Drexel’s art and manuscript collection in 1944. He resigned that year (and thus completed the shortest presidency) to return to private business, later serving as the governor of the State Bank of Ethiopia and dying in 1978 at age 84. 
Disque served as acting president in the interim. Disque Hall was named in his honor in 1967 and he died in 1968.
James Creese became president in 1945 after serving as vice president of the Stevens Institute of Technology. Creese’s two-decades-long reign at Drexel was marked by the hardships of World War II, the post-war increase that doubled the student population and the expansion of Drexel’s campus and curriculum. He resigned in 1963 and died three years later of a heart attack at age 70. The Creese Student Center, opened in 1963, is named for him.
William W. Hagerty started in 1963 after serving as dean of the University of Texas’ College of Engineering. He established several new schools and colleges, plus a graduate program; expanded the campus from 10 to nearly 40 acres; grew the budget tenfold to $80 million; increased the proportion of faculty with PhDs from 24 to 94 percent and doubled student enrollment to 14,000. Hagerty’s forward thinking transformed Drexel into a university in 1970 and made it the first university to require personal computers for students in 1983. He resigned the next year, later dying of cancer at age 70 in 1986. The W. W. Hagerty Library, opened in 1984, is named for him.
University of Delaware dean William S. Gaither became the next president of Drexel in 1984. He created 11 new majors, increased alumni giving and worked on programs to enhance minority student enrollment. After a Drexel employee filed a sexual harassment claim and other allegations followed, Gaither resigned in 1987. In later years, he became the owner/consultant of Gaither  Associates and died in 2009 at age 77.
Alumnus, senior vice president and trustee Harold M. Myers ’38 came out of retirement to serve as interim president from 1987–88. Myers Hall was named for him in 1977. He died of multiple organ failure at age 89 in 2004.
Richard Breslin, a former Catholic priest and president of the University of Charleston in West Virginia, was named Drexel’s president in 1988. At Drexel, he increased alumni giving and strengthened the basketball program. After low undergraduate enrollment and budget cuts, Breslin resigned in 1994. He became the executive vice president and provost at St. Louis University and is now the senior major gift officer and director of development at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.
Drexel alumnus and trustee C.R. “Chuck” Pennoni ('63, '66, Hon. '92) served as interim president.
In 1995, Constantine Papadakis became president at the ailing Drexel, which had low enrollment and cash flow. Papadakis, the second international Drexel president and the only Greek college president in America during his tenure, doubled the full-time undergraduate enrollment and faculty size, tripled freshman applications and quintupled the University's endowment and research funding. He died of complications from lung cancer in 2009 at age 63. The Papadakis Integrated Sciences Building was named after him in 2011. 
Pennoni filled in as interim president again. 
Current president John A. Fry became president in 2010 after previously serving as president of Franklin  Marshall College and executive vice president of the University of Pennsylvania. His vision for Drexel includes transforming the University into what he calls ""the modern urban university of the future"" by using its strengths and resources to serve its community, its neighborhood, its city and the nation. During Fry's presidency, Drexel has created major partnerships in Philadelphia, such as the affiliation with the Academy of Natural Sciences and major neighborhood initiatives, as well as global connections in China, Turkey, Israel, Brazil and Chile.

                                            Update: The University of Maryland at College Park removed William ""Tony"" Rivera from teaching today after the publication of this article:
Content warning: This story includes detailed accounts of sexual harassment. 

                        

                        Editor’s note: The Chronicle has changed the names of students with asterisks next to their names due to the sensitive nature of their stories. This story is the first of two that describes how Duke handled allegations of sexual harassment against a professor. The second story is about how power dynamics and other systemic forces delayed the reporting of sexual harassment in this case.
Last semester, Duke found a professor responsible for violating its sexual harassment policy. Now, he’s at the University of Maryland, where he will be teaching a course next Fall. His supervisor there was not aware that he violated the harassment policy at Duke until The Chronicle contacted him.
In an Office of Institutional Equity investigation, multiple current and former students and staff made sexual harassment allegations against William “Tony” Rivera, former visiting professor with the Social Science Research Institute and director of the Laboratory for Unconventional Conflict Analysis and Simulation (LUCAS). The allegations documented in the OIE sexual harassment report obtained by The Chronicle include making sex-related jokes—such as jokes about genitalia, performing oral sex and the size of his penis—and engaging in “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature.”
In January 2018, the University of Maryland announced that Rivera would work for one of its centers. The center’s director later confirmed he was not aware of the allegations.
Rivera said in a statement that the Duke investigation was not fair.
“In an odd way, though, I’m glad this is public so that a) I can speak to this once for all and b) so that I can finally heal, let this go and move on to doing great work with committed students—the vast majority of whom continue to work with me because they know me, trust me and know not just my mind, but my heart (some have testified in the OIE kangaroo court and spoken to The Chronicle on my behalf),” he wrote. 

                        

                                                                            
                                The Chronicle spoke with seven individuals who were both Rivera’s students and LUCAS staffers about their experiences with him. Three of those students said that Rivera’s conduct was always professional. But the others had a different experience.
‘I just f***ing froze’
One former student, Robert*, described several incidents when he felt Rivera was being predatory. The first incident occurred on the last day of Rivera’s class in 2014, when Rivera took his students to an off-campus bar. Until that point, Robert said Rivera had dropped a few hints that he might be interested in him, such as inviting him to get away for a few days. 
Robert said he denied that request.
                            
                        
                        At the off-campus bar, Robert, who was underage at the time, and other classmates were served alcohol and Robert got “quite drunk.” He left the bar and was walking back to his East Campus dorm. To his surprise, he realized Rivera was just behind him. Robert said they got onto the lawn when Rivera stopped him and said “I want you” multiple times. 
“I just f***ing froze,” Robert said. “I had no idea what to do. It was kind of like everything flashing before your eyes—me deciding whether or not to stay or go. As tipsy as I was, I was really thinking, ‘What happens now? Is this guy going to ruin me if I don't…’ All these thoughts raced through my mind.”
Robert said he thought a safe thing to do would be to kiss Rivera on the cheek, but almost immediately after, he realized it was a big mistake. He told Rivera “I don’t want to do this” and left for his dorm. A few days later, Robert also texted Rivera that he was “uncomfortable with any kind of relationship that exceeds being professionals, teacher and student, and good friends.” 
Rivera responded that the “gist” of Robert’s message was “clear,” according to the report.
In the 2017 OIE investigation report, Rivera said “he ‘bumped into’ [Robert] after leaving [the off-campus bar], and [Robert] kissed him unexpectedly. He did not recall placing his hands on [Robert] or telling [Robert] he wanted him.”
For about a year, Robert said he and Rivera didn’t communicate. Robert knew some of his friends were taking Rivera’s capstone seminar and were involved in his lab. He decided to work with Rivera professionally, as students he trusted worked in Rivera’s lab. 
At an out-of-state conference more than a year after the first incident, Rivera and other conference-goers made plans to go out after dinner, during which some of them drank alcohol, Robert said. They went to a whiskey bar and drank there as well. Robert and Rivera headed back to the hotel. Another student was in Rivera’s room because he was a last-minute addition to the trip, so Robert ended up discussing lab work in Rivera’s hotel room while the other student was asleep.  
“I thought if [the student] is there, this should be okay,” Robert said. “Like if [the student] is there, I'm okay. I can go there to his room, I can bring my journal and we can talk business.”

                                                    
                        

                        At first, everything seemed normal. Rivera was receptive to Robert’s ideas and wanted him to follow up via email, Robert added. Then, they stepped out of the room to get a bottle of water. On the way back, Robert said Rivera surprisingly made a physical advance toward him.
“This time, he more aggressively stops me, turns me around and tries to like kiss me, tries to forcibly kiss me,” Robert said, adding that he was able to lean back so there wasn’t any contact and that he forcibly told Rivera, “No!”
Rivera had a different version of events. In the 2017 OIE investigation report, he “indicated no recollection of attempting to kiss [Robert] during the conference.” 
“I categorically deny, in the strongest possible way, any accusations that state or imply that I have inappropriately touched someone,” he said in his statement to The Chronicle. “Anyone who knows me knows I would never violate someone’s physical space and anyone who knows me well, who knows my personal history, knows why that’s the case.”
Three current and former students referred by Rivera to The Chronicle said that Rivera has never made advances toward them. Those students said that he has always conducted himself in a professional way. One said his experience working with Rivera was “overwhelmingly positive.”
Other allegations
Another student, Noah*, reported unwelcome advances from Rivera since the beginning of their working relationship. For Noah, it was smaller incidents over time. Noah said Rivera told him that he was attracted to him soon after they first met. Noah replied that he was uncomfortable with Rivera saying that.
“[Rivera] wanted to assure me that he would never act on his urges, which I think is so strange that he should have to say that,” Noah said. “I didn't think much of it at the time.” 
Noah said he felt that Rivera was resisting the urge for sexual advances. However, Rivera disputed this in his comments to OIE in the report.
“[Rivera] indicated, ‘without context,’ he did not recall telling [Noah] that he found him attractive, physically and as a person,” the report says. “Dr. Rivera explained he could possibly see himself telling someone he/she was attractive in the appropriate context. Additionally, he explained he could see himself telling [Noah] that he found him attractive in terms of his leadership potential and his potential to contribute to the lab.”
Noah, Robert and another male student, who worked at LUCAS and took Rivera’s class, said that he would make inappropriate comments.
However, three other students The Chronicle interviewed denied ever hearing such comments during the time they have worked with Rivera.
In the OIE report, Rivera had an explanation for unsavory comments and the allegation that he simulated unzipping his pants and asked if his penis was sufficient to make a measurement.
“Dr. Rivera replied that he could not categorically deny he has ever made jokes related to parts of the anatomy. Dr. Rivera stated, ‘As a caveat, I always ask students and staff in the lab to tell me if they are uncomfortable with anything I say,’” the report noted. “In response to the allegation that he simulated unzipping his pants, Dr. Rivera said he did not specifically recall doing so, but it could have been possible, depending on the context and who was present.”
The three students echoed Rivera’s statement, saying that Rivera made it clear that if they felt uncomfortable by his comments, they could tell him. 
“At no point have I witnessed any behavior that I would even remotely consider to be unprofessional,” one of the students said. “Dr. Rivera has consistently made it really clear that he values feedback on his communication style. I’ve never once seen him respond to any feedback like that negatively or disrespectfully.”
Another former student and staffer, Emma*, felt that Rivera had treated her differently after she rejected his proposals to start a romantic relationship. After she rejected him, he turned cold toward her, she claims.
“When I rebutted him the last time, our working relationship changed drastically,” she said. “His mood around me, which had always been joking and friendly with non-work situations and serious and considerate for work-related interactions, turned cold, bordering on hostile.”
In the report, Rivera “declined to provide further response” when asked if he had ever expressed a romantic interest in Emma.
Was the OIE process fair?
In his statement to The Chronicle, Rivera wrote that the OIE investigation was unfair.
“When these accusations were first brought to me I refuted with logic, fact and evidence certain key points in these scurrilous allegations,” he wrote. “These were ignored by the ‘investigator,’ Lonnie Hinton. Not one piece of exculpatory evidence that I brought forth made it into the final report, not one. Further, I pointed out to officials at Duke that the investigation violated Duke policy on several critical points.”
One of his points was that the investigation ignored OIE’s statute of limitations. According to the policy, there is a statute of limitations for when a complainant can file a complaint against professors and supervisors—“no more than a year after the most recent conduct alleged to constitute harassment.”
The report says Robert spoke with OIE in 2014, 2015 and 2017, but did not name Rivera until a fourth time, in May 2017 after his senior spring semester, for fear of retribution. Without the name, OIE could not act. So, although Robert spoke with OIE within a year of each incident, the actual investigation happened two or three years after the events.
Rivera wrote in a statement that because the events took place long ago, it made it hard for him to remember what happened.
“It is impossible to remember years after the fact (which is why Duke has a statute of limitations, which was totally ignored), whether this or that was said, the context in which it was said, who was or was not present and a bunch of other important details, that any researcher (let alone a competent investigator or news outlet) worth their salt would want to know before judging or publishing,” he wrote.
Hinton, equal opportunity and compliance investigator for OIE and the investigator on this case, did not respond in time for publication. Howie Kallem, assistant vice president of OIE, replied on his behalf, noting first that Duke does not comment on specific cases. However, he did make a general statement about the statute of limitations policy.
“Harassment complaints often consist of a series of acts over time; while an individual act may not be a policy violation, a number of acts taken together can cumulatively be sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive to be a policy violation,” he wrote.
OIE’s statute of limitations does have exceptions.
The policy says these exceptions apply “if the nature of the allegation or complaint is particularly egregious,” which will be determined by OIE, and if OIE initiates the complaint within a year of learning about the incident.
There is another way the investigation might not have been in accordance with OIE’s policy.
After Robert reported Rivera by name in May 2017, the OIE investigation gathered comments from seven other current and former students—male and female—who had worked at the lab. The report was released Sept. 4, 2017. 
However, page seven of the OIE policy states that “the informal process shall extend no longer than 45 business days after the allegation is made.” In another place of the same policy—page 10—it says the informal process “will generally take no longer than 45 business days from the time of the filing of the complaint; if the process will take longer, the parties will be notified (including as to the reasons for the delay).” 
This case went through the informal process, as there was no hearing.
“The complaint process is designed to provide a timely, fair and balanced investigation and outcome,” Kallem wrote.
Did Duke comply with Title IX?
The OIE investigation found that Rivera’s conduct was “sufficiently egregious or persistent so as to violate the harassment policy.”
“The information gathered in this investigation is sufficient to support a finding that Dr. Rivera’s conduct created a hostile work and learning environment. The interviews indicated Dr. Rivera consistently made sexually explicit comments to staff and students,” the report stated. “Given the information obtained from the investigation, there is a sufficient showing that Dr. Rivera engaged in unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature with...students and staff under Dr. Rivera’s supervision.”
It is unclear whether Duke had to report this finding to the federal government because of a grant Rivera received.
In 2014, LUCAS under Rivera’s leadership received a three-year, $1.6 million grant from the Minerva Research Initiative, which is administered by the Department of Defense. Because it involves federal funding, the Minerva Initiative must comply with Title IX, said Carla Gleason, public affairs specialist for the Department of Defense. 
She added that Title IX complaints, which can include sexual harassment complaints, should be filed in accordance with a university’s policies and in coordination with the university Title IX coordinator—Kallem at Duke—who is required to report information about those complaints to the Department of Defense. Those reports could initiate DOD investigations and possibly affect the grant.
“We do not have any Title IX complaints [from Duke] at this level,” she wrote last Monday. “That does not mean they don't exist.”
However, Kallem wrote last Friday that Duke did not have to report findings of sexual harassment to the Department of Defense in this case.
“It is our interpretation that the grant that you reference has no requirement for Duke to report findings of harassment to the Department of Defense,” he wrote.
‘Tony came highly recommended to us’
According to page 14 of the OIE Harassment Policy and Procedure, the office will notify the parties of any sanctions that “relate directly to them” and will verify that remedial actions have been implemented. It does not say whether OIE will inform both parties of sanctions, nor does it mention informing anyone not party to the case of disciplinary actions. 
Michael Schoenfeld, vice president for government relations and public affairs, declined to comment about whether Rivera was disciplined for violating the harassment policy to protect the “privacy of our employees and the integrity of the investigative process.” However, he noted that Rivera is no longer an employee of Duke.
Rivera now works at the University of Maryland at College Park. According to UMD’s schedule of classes for Fall 2018, Rivera is slated to teach an online course called “Motivations and Intents of Terrorists and Terrorist Groups.”
A Jan. 24 press release from the University of Maryland noted that Rivera was taking a new job at its National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START). There, he is a “investigator” and “research affiliate.”





    
                
                            
            
            William ""Tony"" Rivera now works for the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) at the University of Maryland at College Park.
        
    

“Tony came highly recommended to us for his passion for counterterrorism focused research that can inform policy and practice, as well as for mentorship,” said William Braniff, START executive director, in the Jan. 24 press release.
There is no mention of who “highly recommended” him. 
When The Chronicle reached out to Braniff, he wrote in a March 16 email that he was not aware of the sexual harassment allegations made against Rivera.
“The allegations referenced in your inquiry to Dr. Rivera are the first that I am learning of this,” he wrote. “I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, so the matter can be addressed.”
Braniff declined to comment further on how the matter would be addressed.

http://www.poconorecord.com/article/20080201/NEWS/80201019,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton sparred, for the most part cordially, over immigration, health care and the war in Iraq in their first one-on-one debate last night as they faced high-stakes Super Tuesday contests that could go a long way toward determining the party's presidential nominee.Clinton emphasized that the nation needed a president ready to go to work on ``Day One.'' Obama responded: ``Part of the argument that I'm making in this campaign is that it is important to be right on Day One.''Five days before Super Tuesday, the two alternated between civility and pointed swipes, underscoring the importance of the upcoming contests. The debate came as Obama's campaign reported raising a staggering $32 million in January, cash aplenty to advertise all through the nearly two dozen upcoming races from coast to coast - and contests beyond.Clinton's campaign reported raising $26.8 million from October through December, the most recent period she reported.Clinton defended the increasingly high-profile role of her husband, former President Clinton, in her campaign and his recent sharp criticism of Obama. ``At the end of the day, it's my name that is on the ballot.''Both were asked about the possibility of a ``dream ticket'' of Clinton-Obama - or Obama-Clinton.``Obviously there's a big difference between those two,'' Obama said. ``I respect Senator Clinton, I think her service to this country is extraordinary.'' But he said, ``We've got a lot more road to travel'' before such a decision.Clinton agreed it was too early to discuss running mates.Both predicted that one of them would be the next president in a history-making inaugural. Obama would be the first black president, Clinton the first female president.Clinton said the Republicans are ``more of the same'' and, gesturing toward Obama, she said, ``We will change our country.''Making amends for his apparent snub of her at Monday's State of the Union Address, Obama assisted Clinton by pulling back her chair as the debate - televised on CNN - began and ended. They then embraced.But it wasn't all sweetness and light.One of their most pointed exchanges came on the question of whether illegal immigrants should be able to obtain driver's licenses. Obama supports doing so; Clinton initially supported it and now opposes it.``Senator Clinton gave a number of different answers over the course of six weeks on this,'' Obama said, turning to Clinton. ``Initially, you said you were for it, then you said you were against it.'' He said he was raising her wavering to underscore that it is ``a difficult political issue.''Clinton called the controversy ``a diversion'' from efforts to come up with comprehensive immigration reform. ``I co-sponsored immigration reform in 2004 before Barack came to the Senate,'' she said.Obama argued for his candidacy, saying, ``I respect Senator Clinton's record. I think it's a terrific record. But I also believe that the skills that I have are the ones that are needed right now to move the country forward, otherwise I wouldn't be running for president.''They also clashed on Iraq.Clinton suggested only she had ``the necessary credentials and gravitas'' to lead the country in withdrawing from Iraq without endangering U.S. forces or further destabilizing the region. She said it was crucial to bring Syria and Iran to the diplomatic table.Obama shot back, ``Senator Clinton mentioned the issue of gravitas and judgment. I think it is much easier for us to have the argument when we have a nominee who says `I always thought this was a bad idea. This was a bad strategy.' It was not just a problem of execution.''Clinton voted in October 2002 to authorize President Bush to use force in Iraq, while Obama opposed such authority in a speech he gave in 2002 as a member of the Illinois state Senate.The two also reached out quickly to backers of former rival John Edwards, who bowed out of the race Wednesday without endorsing either one. Both praised his efforts in their opening statements.Obama called Edwards ``a voice for this party and this country for many years to come.'' Clinton saluted both Edwards and his wife, Elizabeth, as setting ``their personal example of courage and leadership'' in their advocacy for the poor.Asked whether it was good for the country to have another Clinton in the White House, further extending Bush and Clinton family control over government, Clinton drew applause in the Kodak Theatre - home of the Academy Awards - when she replied, ``It did take a Clinton to clean after the first Bush and I think it might take another one to clean up after the second Bush.''The nation's weakening economy was a prime topic, and both candidates said they preferred Democratic-proposed stimulus plans that would give more tax relief to low- and middle-income workers than would Republican proposals.Obama focused on Republican front-runner John McCain, praising McCain's two votes against Bush's first-term tax cuts and questioning his support now for extending them. ``Somewhere along the line, the Straight Talk Express lost some wheels,'' the Illinois senator said, referring to the name of McCain's campaign bus.Both Obama and Clinton nodded in agreement as they compared Democratic economic solutions to those put forward by the GOP.Befitting a Hollywood audience, among the celebrities in the theater were Diane Keaton, Jason Alexander, Pierce Brosnan, Rob Reiner, Stevie Wonder, Kate Capshaw, Steven Spielberg, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bradley Whitford and Gary Shandling.Both candidates acknowledged policy differences but also sought to ratchet back what had become increasingly personal attacks and the animosity of their last debate before the Jan. 26 South Carolina primary, which Obama won by a margin of 2-to-1.Obama appears to have most of the momentum as of now, including high-profile endorsements and impressive fundraising. But Clinton has considerable institutional strength and is still widely favored to do better overall than Obama on Super Tuesday.``I was friends with Hillary Clinton before we started this campaign. I will be friends with Hillary Clinton after this campaign is over,'' Obama said .``We're having a wonderful time,'' Clinton said at one point."

JOHNSON CITY, TN (WJHL) – East Tennessee State University is trying to fire a tenured music professor following an internal investigation that found he sexually harassed two faculty members, according to university records. While he fights his proposed termination, David Champouillon remains on paid suspension.







Hundreds of pages of ETSU records show faculty and students have accused Champouillon of lewd and inappropriate behavior. The university initiated an internal investigation after two faculty members filed sexual harassment complaints in late 2016, records revealed. Both faculty members alleged Champouillon’s inappropriate behavior resulted in a hostile work environment in ETSU’s music department. The investigation substantiated the allegations, according to records.



ETSU notified Champouillon that the university was seeking his “Termination for Adequate Cause” in November for “Capricious disregard of accepted standards of professional conduct,” according to university records.



Some of the allegations are graphic. They include comments Champouillon reportedly made about students and co-workers’ bodies, his personal sex life and other unwanted sexual comments, according to records. The investigation revealed his behavior went back years, to as early as 2009, and identified at least 50 instances, according to ETSU records.



The investigation found, among other things, that he once insinuated a colleague looked like a stripper in the presence of students, saying “All you’re missing is a pole,” according to his termination letter. The university’s Title IX investigator also found Champouillon once made a derogatory comment about a female colleague, according to records.







The investigation found in 2016, he shined a flashlight on a student’s rear end and told her “that looks nice,” he told a student her boots and glasses “are very sexy” and when a student delivered a box to his office later that year, called her “a pretty young lady” and asked her to bend over and open it, adding “You’ve done me a favor, now I owe you one. They call me the fixer around here,” according to ETSU records.





ETSU placed Champouillon on administrative leave in September after the university received the complaints, records revealed. The professor appealed the decision, but a committee upheld his paid suspension by a vote of 6-1 last month pending the outcome of formal disciplinary proceedings, according to ETSU records. According to state records, Champouillon’s annual salary is $63,000.



Champouillon’s attorney Jim Culp insists the man has never done anything inappropriate.



“I can’t try the case in the media, but the fact is he just hasn’t done these things,” Culp said. “They’re two sides to every story. Things that Dr. Champouillon has been accused of he vigorously denies. He has not done those things. He has not harassed anyone.”



Culp acknowledges the professor’s personality can be off-putting to some. He and his client suggest disgruntled faculty and former students have made up lies about him.





“He’s outspoken and sometimes brash, but he is courteous and respectful of people too,” Culp said. “He’s a decent man who can be abrasive and there are times, I think, when people get angry with him and don’t let go of grudges very easily. I think that he has had concerted hostility directed toward him, not by the university as an institution, but by people within its community.”



Culp, the son of a former ETSU president, says Champouillon intends to fight the university, the allegations, and the proposed termination all the way. As an attorney, he says he only takes on the university when ETSU is wrong.



“I think they’re dead wrong,” he said of the university.



Champouillon denied the accusations himself in an October letter to ETSU’s Office of Equity and Diversity.





“I categorically deny these accusations,” he said in the letter. “Overall, these complaints about 4-5 years of improper behavior, are the result of students lying to faculty, other faculty lying to faculty, or the appearance of administrators breaking personnel confidentiality…The allegations are baseless, unwitnessed, hearsay, double hearsay, undocumented, and even simply made up out of a fear – a fear that has been propagated by disgruntled former students and faculty…These false accusations have done irreparable harm to my reputation and adversely affected the education of ETSU trumpet and jazz ensemble students.”



ETSU spokesperson Joe Smith said the university can’t talk about the details of the case.







“It’s our policy that we don’t comment on the specifics of any kind of personnel investigation here at the university,” Smith said. “We take any complaint of sexual harassment very seriously and they are investigated.”



In general terms, Smith said the outcomes and disciplinary action that result from personnel investigations vary depending on the nature of the allegations and the behavior that took place.





“Sexual harassment is a behavior that goes against the mission and values of the institution and against our belief that people should be treated with dignity and respect,” Smith said. “It goes against who we are as an institution and that’s why the behavior won’t be tolerated.”



Champouillon’s termination hearing has yet to be scheduled, his attorney said. He is not allowed to be on ETSU property without prior permission, according to university records.



Champouillon is not charged with any crime in connection to this investigation.

http://www.wcyb.com/news/tennessee/johnson-city/update-champouillon-out-at-etsu-following-sexual-harrassment-investigation/507176844,"East Tennessee State University President Brian Noland said evidence from an internal investigation was clear and convincing, leading him to fire the school's Director of Jazz Studies David Champouillon on Friday.A notice of charges against Champouillon was issued on Jan. 30, 2016 after fellow faculty members accused the professor of sexual harassment. News 5's Kristi O'Connor reported in March that he had been disciplined by the Johnson City school for misconduct and other violations on five different occasions dating back to 2010.A copy of Champouillon termination letter supplied to News 5 said Noland said he had been reviewing the case since February and concurred with the Adequate Cause Committee's recommendation to fire him.That committee said the instructor had repeated angry outbursts and made sexual comments and innuendos toward students and faculty.The jazz teacher had been on paid administrative leave pending the decision."
https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/08/01/eastern-michigan-professor-denied-tenure-because-sexual-harassment-issues,"A faculty member at Eastern Michigan University was suspended over sexual harassment claims. He returned a year later, in 2008, and taught for several years, but was then denied tenure. When he reapplied, after an arbitrator agreed with the faculty union that proper rules were not followed the first time, he was denied tenure once again, and the provost cited sexual harassment  as a reason, according to the letter denying him tenure.
The case involves Edwin Etter, an associate professor of accounting at the university’s business school, who was denied tenure earlier this year. He will depart in August, 2013, but according to a local website he will be on “desk duty” till then. Walter Kraft, vice president for communications at the university, declined to comment on the case while Etter did not respond to phone and e-mail requests for an interview.
In the letter denying tenure to Etter, Kim Schatzel, provost and vice president, said the professor's record of repeated sexual harassment (against students and one staff member) could not be ignored, despite his strong teaching and service record. The Detroit Free Press, which viewed a report on the university's investigation into the allegations and quoted from it,  reported that Etter told a female student that she would do better on an exam if she wore a short skirt and high heels. The newspaper said students complained about being touched on the shoulder and thigh by Etter, who also told an employee that he wished he were under her desk.
The newspaper also quoted from Etter's tenure application where he apologized for his conduct. ""I am truly sorry for the conduct that led to my suspension, and I want to take this opportunity to again apologize to the EMU community for my actions,"" he wrote in his application, according to The Detroit Free Press. ""I believe my conduct over the past four years and one-half (years) demonstrates that I will not repeat the actions that led to my suspension.""
According to Eastern Michigan's collective bargaining contract for faculty, a faculty member can be denied tenure on ""justifiable facts"" based on performance or other issues, and Schatzel's letter pointed out that Etter had not satisfied the terms of the contract.
And though neither Etter or administrators are keen to talk, the situation raises questions about why he was allowed to teach for several years after the university found that he had harassed multiple times, and yet denied him tenure citing those claims. Experts called the case intriguing and complex, from the perspectives of students and of the professor.
Theresa Beiner, associate dean of faculty development and a law professor at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, said tenure is seen as giving lifetime employment to someone barring significant misconduct, and she wondered if that factor played into the Eastern Michigan’s decision.
“I think the distinguishing factor here was the tenure decision,” said Beiner, who is an expert on sexual harassment issues in higher education. Beiner said that a university might not want to increase its risk in certain situations. “It is a tough situation for the employee, and the university, which is caught in a catch-22 situation.”
As for the perspective of the victims, Beiner noted that the professor was suspended and attended counseling sessions. “Thus, the university at least attempted to address the victims' concerns and did more than simply slap him on the wrist, so to speak,” she said in an e-mail. “I can't tell if that was done here, but it is a possibility that the victims were consulted about the punishment and thought it was appropriate.”
Beiner wondered if the results would have been any different if universities had stronger rules for “de-tenuring.”
Some pointed to the complex nature of the tenure process, and how different groups can have different opinions.
Ann Franke, president of Wise Results, LLC, a consulting firm on higher education issues, said that, although the best institutions have clear standards for tenure, faculty evaluations involve a lot of people.
“Reviewers in the initial stages may feel one way about a candidate while those in later stages may feel differently. Reasonable people may disagree about the seriousness of a faculty member’s shortcomings and his or her success in correcting them,” Franke wrote in an e-mail. “Opinions of peers should receive considerable, although not dispositive, weight in the final decision.”
Franke, who wasn’t commenting specifically about Eastern Michigan, said that if a faculty member does not meet the standards of an institution, it might be prudent to decline to renew that person’s contract earlier rather than later. “Both the individual and the institution have less invested in the relationship at its earlier stages,” she said.
The American Association of University Professors expects university administrators to follow a recommendation by a faculty body, unless there is a rare and compelling reason not to do so, said Greg Scholtz, director of academic freedom, tenure and governance for the association.
Scholtz said that if the professor’s misconduct was grave, he could have been dismissed for cause or not reappointed. “There might have been this assumption that this was misconduct capable of being remediated… and for the person to meet the standards of tenure,” he said. “On one hand, it seems, he addressed the problems. Now, we are getting the message, he did not address the problems and he has to leave. It doesn’t make sense to me.”
But what about the issue of exposing more students to a faculty member who has been found to be sexually harassing students despite counseling?
 “There is a social culture of misusing power in sexual harassment cases. As a feminist, I wouldn’t want to give a person a chance to engage in such behavior,” said Michelle Hughes Miller, an associate professor of sociology and women’s and gender studies at the University of South Florida. “But as a criminologist, I want to say that one can learn from sanctions and change their behavior.”

                A former Eastern Washington University student who claims a respected professor sexually assaulted her is suing him and the school.
April Strader, who graduated with honors in 1996, filed a civil lawsuit this week in Spokane County Superior Court.
She is seeking unspecified damages from EWU and William Daniel Perdue, a former sociology professor at the university.
   Strader maintains in the suit that Perdue got her drunk at an off-campus bar in March 1996, then sexually assaulted her for several hours. He denies the charges.
She was taking a class from Perdue at the time, and he also was acting as her “mentor and adviser,” according to the suit.
He asked her to go with him to the Ramada Inn lounge near Spokane International Airport so they could talk about her classes and work at the college newspaper, the suit states.
Strader claims she is suffering “economic, physical and emotional damages as a result of the mental distress she has experienced.”
In May 1996, sheriff’s detectives investigated her complaints, as well as those of another student who claimed Perdue fondled her. Prosecutors determined there was not enough evidence to charge him with a crime.
Perdue’s attorney, Carl Hueber of Spokane, said his client passed a lie-detector test as part of that investigation.
Soon after, Perdue negotiated an early retirement from the university, which included a two-year leave of absence without pay.
Perdue, who had taught at the Cheney school since 1969 and had been honored as a teacher and author, was forbidden from returning to campus as part of the agreement.
Strader says her constitutional rights were violated because Perdue’s actions amounted to sex discrimination. The university has a duty to protect its students from such discrimination, the suit contends.
On Thursday, Hueber called the suit a last-ditch effort by Strader to get money. Perdue and EWU rejected a claim for damages filed by her in July 1996.
“Allegations of sexual misconduct coupled with monetary claims are easily made,” he said. “There are two sides to every story. Dr. Perdue looks forward to telling his side in a courtroom and is confident he will be fully exonerated.”
Perdue, 54, also intends to counter-sue for defamation, Hueber said.
EWU spokeswoman Stefanie Pettit said university policy prohibits her from commenting. “There are some things I’d like to say, but I can’t at this time,” she said.

The public liberal arts university in Pennsylvania has settled a sexual harassment lawsuit filed by a former student. In his federal lawsuit, Cameron Aulner, a 2009 graduate of Edinboro had alleged that William Chandler, a Communication and Media Studies professor had made suggestive comments in class and asked him on a date in 2008.  Aulner alleged in his lawsuit that the university failed to take action despite his complaints to the Ombuds and other administrators.  Edinboro reportedly paid $495,000 in the settlement.  
The operative complaint in the lawsuit named as defendants University President Jeremy Brown; Janet Dean, Associate VP of Human Resources; Terry Warburton, Chair of the Communications and Media Studies  Department; and Valerie Hayes, Director of Social Equity and Ombudsperson.  (Chandler was dropped from the lawsuit after he committed suicide in December 2009.)  The student, Aulner, alleged that he complained at least twice to Hayes, although it was not clear whether that was in her capacity as Director of Social Equity or as Ombuds.  Nonetheless, Aulner said that Hayes told him in a letter the university would take steps to correct the situation with Chandler, but that the harassment persisted.    In court records, Edinboro admitted that administrators had investigated some of the claims made against Chandler, but denied that the school's retention of the professor violated Aulner's rights.  (Original USDC Complaint; Edinboro Spectator; Go Erie News.)
Aulner, who is paraplegic, gained notoriety in his hometown last October when he tackled a suspected child molester fleeing a crime.  (Denver Post.)

  TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) — A former secretary who claimed she was sexually harassed by a former dean at a Southern California college will receive $2.5 million.
The Daily Breeze of Torrance says El Camino College settled a lawsuit with Nyesha Artiaga last month. The community college will pay about a third of the settlement and its insurance company will pay most of the rest. The former dean James Schwartz, will pay $25,000.
Under last month's settlement Artiaga agreed to quit her job and never to apply for employment with the college again.
In court documents, Artiaga claimed that between 2007 and 2009, Schwartz groped her and threatened to fire her if she refused to have sex with him.
Schwartz said the two had a consensual relationship.

https://www.dailybreeze.com/2012/03/21/el-camino-college-settles-2nd-sexual-harassment-suit-against-former-dean/," | SCHOOL NEWS | BLOG 
For the second time in a little more than a year, a female employee at El Camino College has received a large settlement of a lawsuit claiming sexually harassment by a former vice president and dean. 
El Camino administrative assistant Linda Olsen charged that, from 2004 to 2010, James Schwartz – who worked as a dean in several departments over the years – glared at her breasts, subjected her to unwanted touching, kissing, and groping, and made demands for unwanted sex, according to court documents. She also accused him of threatening to punish her with negative job evaluations or even termination if she refused to have sex with him. 
Olsen, a 53-year-old Torrance resident, was awarded $750,000 on Feb. 29. The settlement came about a year after she filed the claim, and about 14 months after another woman, former secretary Nyesha Artiaga of Los Angeles, received a $2.5 million award for a sexual-harassment suit against the same man, who is now 75 years old. About 40 percent of Olsen’s settlement will go to her attorneys, the Meyers Law Group of Rancho Cucamonga. 
As in the Artiaga case, El Camino College was on the hook for just a third of the payout. An insurance provider covered the balance. 
“I’m disappointed in the whole thing,” El Camino board President Bill Beverly said Wednesday, adding that the Torrance-area college opted to settle on the advice of the insurance carrier. “I’m disappointed in everybody who was anywhere near the problem, if there was one.” 				
El Camino has been the target of several sexual harassment suits in recent years. 
Olsen’s settlement marks the fourth completion of such cases filed by former female El Camino employees against their male bosses in the last year and a half. In two of the cases, the college prevailed at trial. But the Olsen and Artiaga cases were both settled with the help of a mediator before going to trial. 				
Schwartz, who now lives by himself in Palm Desert, denies the accusations of both women. He added that he hadn’t even heard of the Olsen settlement until a reporter called his home on Wednesday. 
“I feel victimized,” he said. “It’s just amazing what people can do to destroy your reputation.” 
Of the allegations, he said, “All I can say is they’re not true.” 
The Olsen complaint was less incendiary and explicit than the one filed by Artiaga, who is now 34. Artiaga’s lawyers claimed that Schwartz – her superior – raped her in his locked office “and eventually ejaculated on plaintiff’s underwear.” Artiaga also accused Schwartz of offering her up to $800 in exchange for sex in hotel rooms. (Schwartz did not deny that they had a sexual relationship, but contended in court documents that it was consensual.) 
Meanwhile, Olsen’s complaint says she was subjected to harassment and retaliation in the form of being yelled at, ignored, isolated, having work taken away from her, and criticized regarding her work. 
“(Olsen) failed to complain about Mr. Schwartz’s behavior because she feared that she would lose her job if she did so,” Olsen’s attorney, David Myers, said in court documents. Myers did not return a call Wednesday seeking comment. 
The documents go on to say Schwartz warned Olsen that he had a good relationship with her union president, and that the union would believe him over her. 
In what appears to be a connection to the Artiaga case, the complaint says that in December 2010 – right around the time attorneys were investigating Artiaga’s claim – Schwartz left a message on Olsen’s voice mail instructing her to lie under penalty of perjury about what had allegedly happened between Schwartz and Olsen. 
The documents say Schwartz’s treatment of Olsen grew more harsh “when another female employee began having an open relationship with Mr. Schwartz.” In addition, Olsen’s camp claims that the alleged misconduct took the form of quid-pro-quo harassment, in which Olsen was “required to have sex with Defendant Schwartz in order to receive good performance evaluations.” 
While the terms of Artiaga’s settlement called for her to sever ties with El Camino, Olsen’s agreement included no such clause. She still works as an administrative assistant in the college’s athletic department. 
Schwartz, who for many years served as the college’s dean of health sciences and athletics, said Wednesday that he knew Olsen had filed some sort of allegation. He was under the impression there had been an internal investigation that had cleared him of any wrongdoing. 
“My regret is that all this stuff is ruining my reputation,” he said. “That people can just sit down and write up stuff and get rewarded for it. … I certainly loved El Camino.” 
As the dean of health sciences, Schwartz started the El Camino Hall of Fame and the El Camino golf tournament. 
Schwartz’s administrative career with El Camino spanned four decades. He served as dean of health sciences and athletics from 1975 to 1996, interim vice president of academic affairs from 1996 to 2005, interim dean of fine arts from 2007 to 2009, and the interim dean of the health services and athletics division from 2009 until his departure in June 2010. 
In 2009, he was inducted into the El Camino College Athletic Hall of Fame. During his last year at El Camino, his annual salary was about $141,000, according to a college record. 
Beverly, the board president, said the college was instructed to settle by the insurance carrier, SWAAC, which represents a pool of about 50 community college districts. He said the school could have opted to gamble by fighting the case in court, but then would run the risk of paying in full if it lost. 
“Regardless of whether the claim was believable or not, and regardless of the validity of the various defenses that were available, and in spite of how it might look to a jury – with the plaintiff saying `I want a piece of that, too,’ our insurance carrier wanted to settle it,” he said. 
El Camino College pays about $350,000 a year for general liability insurance. College spokeswoman Ann Garten said the two recent payouts aren’t expected to increase the cost of the college’s premium. 
“An insurance carrier is not going to look at an individual college,” she said. “It will look at the whole (pool).” 
Although the two payouts are a blow to the El Camino Community College District, the school has recently prevailed in two similar cases. 
In October 2010, the college was vindicated when a judge ruled mostly in favor of the district in a sexual harassment and discrimination case filed by a former dean, Kristi Blackburn, who claimed she was the victim of a “good old boys” club. 
In March of last year, a jury ruled in favor of the college over professor Carmen Hunt, who charged that her bosses had tried to force her out because of her extended leaves of absence. She attributed the missed work to post-traumatic stress suffered after an alleged sexual assault by a former dean years ago.

ELON, N.C. – An Elon University adjunct professor has been dismissed from his job after he allegedly sent inappropriate text messages to students.
Elon Local News reported that Religious Studies professor Hans Arneson was dismissed from the university this semester.
Arneson is accused of sending sexually suggestive messages to junior Amy DeNenno and another inappropriate message to at least one other student.
DeNenno said she was a student in Arneson’s Introduction to the New Testament in the fall. She said the professor started sending her text messages after the two grabbed lunch one day after class.
The texting allegedly turned inappropriate, talking about meeting outside of class and drinking alcohol, even though DeNenno is underage.
DeNenno said going to class became uncomfortable and she even started skipping some classes. She informed university officials about the matter in February.
One text message read, “I wanted to duck into a room with you for a few mins when you left the room for a sec. Just five mins to taste your lips and tease a lil…”
Another student, who chose to remain anonymous, said she received a text from Arneson that read, “You could have joined me in my daily after-class shot in my office!”
Arneson declined to comment when asked by Elon Local News.

http://www.wbur.org/artery/2018/09/05/robert-todd-sexual-harassment-emerson-statement,"The Emerson professor and filmmaker who was found dead in a park this summer had been suspended without pay for the fall semester for sexual harassment, according to a statement the college sent to staff and also posted on its website Tuesday.Robert Todd, a 54-year-old influential filmmaker who had served as the associate chair of the school’s Department of Visual and Media Arts, had been reported missing on Aug. 16. Emerson president Lee Pelton announced his death a couple of days later. Todd’s body was discovered at Franklin Park in Jamaica Plain. The cause of death has not been released.In a rare statement of this nature, Pelton wrote to staff saying that he wished to clarify the spread of “misleading and false statements … with the sad patina of truth.”Pelton wrote that after a months-long independent investigation that began in December 2017 when an Emerson staff member came forward with a complaint, “Professor Todd was found responsible for engaging in sexual harassment.""Emerson had notified Todd that he’d be suspended without pay for the fall 2018 semester, according to Pelton.The college also required Todd to work with a professional coach to “help him understand the impact of his behaviors as well as to ensure that they would not occur in the future,” the statement read.During the investigation, which was conducted by an outside investigator, Emerson received additional information about Todd that could have constituted a violation of the school’s Sexual Misconduct Policy. According to Pelton, Emerson interviewed those involved and found “insufficient evidence” to support the additional claims.When Pelton announced Todd’s death in August, the president offered condolences to Todd's students, colleagues, family and wife — Tessa Day, a fellow artist, writer and a graduate student at Emerson.In the most recent statement, Pelton said the college sought, in the immediate aftermath, to provide space and time to those mourning Todd’s death. He stressed the anomalous circumstances that led him to address rumors surrounding it.""While the college typically does not release such information, these extraordinary circumstances, the very public nature of Professor Todd’s death, the promulgations of falsehoods, and the continuing circulation of rumors and speculations, compelled me to speak to you today in order to provide an accurate and true accounting."""

http://archive.naplesnews.com/news/local/fgcu-president-merwin-resigns-after-inappropriate-relationship-ep-405013798-345700912.html,"By Jessie L. Bonner,Melissa Cassutt
                
                    William Merwin has resigned as president of Florida Gulf Coast University because he had an inappropriate relationship with a female faculty member.    The university's 67-year-old leader made the announcement at the student union building during a 3 p.m. emergency meeting of the college board of trustees. He asked the board of trustees to accept his early retirement. The board agreed.  Merwin's departure is effective immediately. The board named Richard Pegnetter, the dean of the College of Business, as acting president.  Pegnetter said of Merwin: 'I think he made a very courageous and correct decision.''  Board members said Merwin broke the news to them last week, and they immediately ordered an audit of the college's finances.  The board is considering a retirement package equal to one year's compensation, plus benefits. The board agreed not to vote on that proposal until the audit is complete, which should be sometime next week.  Merwin read from a prepared statement and spoke briefly to a room that was standing-room only by the end of the meeting. 'I accept full responsibility for my actions,'' Merwin said. ''I do not want to be in a position where I cannot fully do my duties.''  FGCU officials are not identifying the woman with whom Merwin had the relationship. University spokeswoman Susan Evans said the woman was a faculty member from one of the colleges but would not say which one. She said the woman did not report directly to Merwin.  The woman still works at the university and her job will not be affected, Evans said.    Michael Villalobos, a member of the board of trustees since 2000, said he was shocked when he first heard the revelation.  'My initial reaction is that I'm surprised over the circumstances which President Merwin has presented his resignation,' he said. 'It's difficult to put into words how to express my feelings over the situation.'  'This board's direction and waiting for a result of an internal audit is in no way a reflection of President Merwin's leadership in the last seven years as president of the university. He's done an outstanding job.'  Villalobos said he wants to find a new president who displays Merwin's leadership skills, but recognizes there will be an adjustment period.  'In the same token, with every new leader, each one has their different positives ... We're just going to have to wait and see whether it's going to affect the university.'  Reaction was swift among students and community members.    'He made a mistake and he fessed up to it,'' said Kirt Gallatin, student body president. 'It took a lot of courage to stand up at that podium. I don't think I could have done it.''  Jameson Yingling, student body vice president and a member of the presidential search committee, said he first heard the news about Merwin this morning but otherwise had not known about it.  'It's unfortunate and students are shocked by it but I haven't heard one bit of concern that the university is going to falter,' he said. 'No one around here feels that we're going to sink without him.'   'You just have to focus on the positive,' he said. 'This university will move on.'  Kenneth Walker, who has been president of Edison College for 15 years, said he was 'saddened by the news.''  'I think Dr. Pegnetter is a very capable administrator and he will do a fine job in the interim,'' Walker said. 'I'm sure the university will just move right along.'  When asked what kind of effect losing a president might have on FGCU, Walker said,  'I don't know, I've never really experienced this kind of thing in my career.'  'When the new president is selected then we'll certainly look forward to working with that person and maintaining our good and cooperative relationship.'  Arnold Rosenthal, member of the Estero Council of Community Leaders, said his first reaction on hearing the news was, 'Shame on him.''  'All I can say is I hope the next university president would have more of a concern for the community that invited the university in in the first place,'' Rosenthal said.  Meg Judge, chair of the Estero Chamber of Commerce, has been involved with the university's efforts for a $5 million aquatic center.  'Like any institution you have victories and disappointments,'' Judge said. 'I'm sure that the university will continue to grow and it's not tarnished by one person's actions.'  Don Eslick of the Estero Council of Community Leaders said, 'President Merwin was probably the right guy for the times, where you had to work closely with the private sector and the State in order to build the university in its early growth phase.'  Eslick said, though, he was hopeful whoever succeeds Merwin will be more sensitive to land use and community development issues.  'We've had our differences with him relative to land issues,' he said. 'I can understand the fact that they want to grow beyond their existing boundaries, but we would hope that they would consult with those of us who have an interest in that being a good decision for everybody. I would hope that the board would search for that kind of person.'  FGCU staff began setting up the student union ballroom about an hour before the meeting was to begin. By 2:30 p.m., the room began filling with reporters and members of the FGCU Foundation, the board of trustees and the Faculty Senate.  Andrew Townsend, Jr. is the sports editor at the Eagle News, the student newspaper, and is covering Merwin's resignation. He said it's big news on campus.  'The rumors have been flying,'' Townsend said. 'I had no idea this was coming.''  The Florida Board of Governors was not given the details of the meeting beforehand, said board spokesman Bill Edmonds.  The position of the president is one that is overseen by the board of trustees that govern each individual state university, Edmonds said.  'The board of governors does have to ratify a new president,' he said.  Merwin was named president of the 10th state university in 1999, after the position was left vacant by founding president Roy McTarnaghan, who resigned the same year.  To take the job at FGCU, Merwin left his position as president of Salisbury State University in Maryland. At the time, FGCU was barely 2 years old and still largely viewed as a distance-learning campus geared toward commuter students.  Merwin was selected by the FGCU board of trustees from a list of prospective presidents and was charged with creating a road map for the youngest university in the statewide system. With 14 years of experience as university president under his belt, Merwin has previously been employed on campuses in New York and Montana.  Last year, the FGCU Board of Trustees approved his base annual salary at $298,000, nearly double the amount compared to his first year, when Merwin made $176,000 annually.  Today, about 12 administrators report directly to him, including some of the university's original deans. Student growth has been among his top goals during his tenure at FGCU. Under his presidency, the campus has grown from 2,000 students to more than 8,000. Degree programs also have increased at a rapid pace; the university opened with about 25 degree programs in 1997 and now offers more than 60.  As Merwin ushered the university into the fall semester, future goals included seeing the university through its jump into Division I athletics and garnering federal money to create a transportation center near the main campus.  Merwin said would also like to see the university continue to offer programs that will keep more college graduates in Southwest Florida and contribute to the local work force.  He is married to Debra Merwin, with three sons and six grandchildren.

http://www.miaminewtimes.com/news/former-fiu-architecture-dean-accused-of-raping-student-on-study-abroad-trip-8435734,"

At the end of a semester-long study-abroad program in Genoa, Italy, in December 2014, a group of architecture students from Florida International University went out for a celebratory dinner. After the meal, many students and a handful of faculty members grabbed drinks at a local bar. At 2 a.m., three of the students were ready to leave. 

According to one of those students, Adam Drisin, then FIU's senior associate dean of architecture, asked if the students could walk him back to his apartment. Inside, Drisin offered the students some Baileys liqueur, which they all drank.

That's when the night out with a professor turned into a sexual assault. At least that's what one student alleges in a new federal lawsuit against Drisin filed in the U.S. Southern District of Florida. 

Reached by New Times, Drisin  — who left FIU last year — denies the allegations. ""It's a frivolous lawsuit,"" he tells New Times. ""Everything in it is inaccurate."" 

The student's claims are a blow to one of FIU's premier schools and to a fast-rising academic. Drisin earned degrees from Cornell and Harvard, where he also taught before joining FIU in August 2004. He served as chair and director of FIU's School of Architecture before rising to senior associate dean of the College of Architecture and the Arts.  

In December 2014, he visited Genoa to check on a group of students in the program. The lawsuit lays out a stark narrative of assault against an unnamed female student following that night of drinking. 

According to the complaint filed by Brickell attorney Omar Malone, after drinking the Baileys, one of the three students who went home with Drisin fell asleep at the foot of his bed. Another was awoken by her two friends the next morning. 

She was naked in Drisin's bed, her attorney alleges in the lawsuit, with no recollection of what had happened the previous night. The woman was wearing a tampon that night and says when she woke up, it was lodged deep inside of her. It was then she realized she'd been raped, she alleges. 

In the lawsuit, the student suggests the women may have been incapacitated in Drisin's apartment ""as result of a foreign substance being put in [their] Baileys."" 

Back at her apartment that morning, the woman confided in a friend and asked for advice about how to report the incident. Later that day, she spoke via Skype with one of her professors, who immediately informed FIU officials.

FIU declined to provide New Times with any records connected to the case or Drisin's employment, citing an ongoing investigation. It's not clear whether Italian police were involved in the case; the student's attorney says no police reports were filed. FIU Police, meanwhile, were unable to locate a report relating to the student's claim.

The lawsuit does contain excerpts from emails that Drisin allegedly sent the next day. In one message sent around 4:30 p.m. that next day, the dean tells the student, ""I feel terrible right now,"" and asks if he could meet up to speak with her and one of the other students.

""I owe you both something important and I need to deliver it to you in person before you leave and before I leave. I know this is not easy, but I’m asking that you please indulge me,"" Drisin allegedly writes in the email.

Drisin sent a second email later that night, according to Malone, asking another of the students if they could meet up for coffee. 

""Today has been a very difficult day for me,"" he writes, according to a screenshot of the email. ""As you might imagine, I need to talk with you and this is not easy.""

Malone, the student's attorney, says he is still trying to contact the other two women who were in Drisin's apartment the night of the alleged assault. He said he has information suggesting one of them was in a romantic relationship with Drisin and believes she may have been a witness to the alleged crime.

Drisin left FIU September 14, 2015. At that time, his annual salary was $110,093. School officials declined to give the reason for his departure or provide information about the university's investigation into the alleged assault, saying it is ongoing and active.

Since leaving FIU, Drisin has applied for jobs with at least two other architecture schools. Late last week, he was served with the lawsuit for sexual battery while on campus at University of Nebraska-Lincoln interviewing for dean of the university’s College of Architecture. He is one of four finalists for the job, according to UNL. 

Drisin also interviewed for a dean position at Texas Tech University’s College of Architecture in January. A news alert from the university says he was one of two candidates.

Representatives from both schools have yet to respond to requests for comment from New Times. We'll update this post with their responses if we hear back.

Drisin said he had not yet retained a lawyer and declined to comment further on the allegations. As of Thursday, he has not filed a response in federal court.

Update: On June 23, 2016, the student voluntarily dismissed her lawsuit against Drisin. Drisin has a pending lawsuit against Florida International University for wrongful termination.

Report faults FSU president 

An investigation finds that officials failed to enforce the school's sexual harassment policy.

By DIANE RADO
© St. Petersburg Times, published August 3, 2000



   TALLAHASSEE -- For more than a decade, Florida State University failed to properly investigate and resolve sexual harassment complaints against a law school professor accused of everything from making crude comments in the classroom to exposing himself to a female student, a new report says.
   FSU president and former law school dean Talbot ""Sandy"" D'Alemberte ""bears direct responsibility"" for that failure, according to the findings of an exhaustive investigation into sexual harassment allegations and other issues that have tainted the law school's reputation.
   Since last spring, at least six law school faculty members have left, including women who charged that FSU failed to respond to or condoned discrimination, harassment and inappropriate conduct. The university's office of inspector general hired an outside law firm -- BakerBotts of Austin, Texas -- to look into the allegations.
   The report released Wednesday came to two conclusions that pleased FSU officials: no pattern of sexual harassment of female students by male faculty, and no evidence of a hostile work work environment, based on gender or race.
   However, FSU's handling of allegations against law professor William McHugh, and D'Alemberte's role in that case, is severely criticized.
   While FSU had policies in place to protect students against sexual harassment, D'Alemberte and other FSU administrators ""consciously neglected in certain circumstances to enforce FSU's clear written policy for handling such complaints,"" the report states.
   The investigators noted that D'Alemberte's close working relationship and high regard for McHugh's wife, Donna McHugh -- who works in university relations at FSU -- ""creates an appearance of impropriety and favoritism.""
   ""Any judgment D'Alemberte renders in the matter lacks credibility and may be questioned . . ."" the report states.
   In a written response to the conclusions, D'Alemberte accused investigators of distorting statements, engaging in ""sloppy thinking"" and a ""gross distortion of the record,"" among other criticisms.
   D'Alemberte also pointed out his record in improving the handling of sexual harassment complaints: He replaced FSU's general counsel; pushed for the creation of a new sexual harassment policy that requires all complaints to go to the FSU's inspector general's office; and urged the inspector general to conduct education sessions on sexual harassment and other issues for faculty and staff.
   ""When I became president I was not satisfied with the way that we were doing things . . . and took action to remedy these problems,"" D'Alemberte wrote.
   D'Alemberte, 67, began serving as FSU president in 1994, and had served as law school dean between 1984 and 1989.
   In the 1980s, problems were already brewing with McHugh, a law school professor who was running a center for employment relations and law at FSU.
   Staff complained about his offensive and obscene language, his dirty jokes and his degrading comments about women, records show. After one women filed a formal complaint about McHugh's behavior, personnel official Jim Tinsley went to D'Alemberte.
   ""His response to me was that he didn't want anything to do with it,"" Tinsley told investigators.
   While McHugh was a law school professor, D'Alemberte said McHugh reported to another supervisor and not to the law school dean.
   He said he recalled being told by the Dean of Faculties that this was not a matter for the law school.
   D'Alemberte also said he had ""no knowledge, not even hearsay knowledge,"" of a second complaint against McHugh in the late 1980s. But investigators took issue with his version of events: ""D'Alemberte's statements that he was not involved, was told to stay out, and did not know what happened are not credible,"" the reports states.
   The allegations against McHugh would continue.
   In February 1996, a law school student complained that McHugh was making sexually offensive remarks in class and racially offensive remarks outside of class.
   FSU Provost Lawrence G. Abele acknowledged that the complaint ""just sort of drifted,"" until June 1997, and said there was ""no reason why this should have been allowed to lay around so long,"" according to the report.
   D'Alemberte gave McHugh a letter dated June 24, 1997, warning that McHugh's use of profanity and off-color remarks in the classroom is unacceptable.
   Investigators noted that D'Alemberte initially provided an unsigned copy of the letter to McHugh, allowing him a chance to read it and acknowledge that it was appropriate before D'Alemberte signed it.
   A year later, the most serious charge against McHugh surfaced:
   While in his office, McHugh was showing a law school student and another research assistant his hernia scar when his pants slipped down, exposing his stomach and penis.
   The law school student filed a formal complaint.
   After a series of reviews of the case, McHugh was given a written reprimand.
   McHugh, 67, remains a tenured professor at the law school, although he is not teaching class. He is working a center for professional development at FSU, helping with legal courses offered on-line and reviewing contracts with state agencies.
   There have been no complaints against him, said Susann Rudasill, associate director at the center.
   State university system chancellor Adam Herbert had not yet received the FSU report Wednesday afternoon, but plans to review it, a spokesman said.

http://www.nndb.com/people/403/000058229/,"Deal HudsonAKA Deal Wyatt HudsonBorn: 30-Nov-1949Birthplace: Denver, COGender: MaleReligion: Roman CatholicRace or Ethnicity: WhiteSexual orientation: StraightOccupation: ReligionParty Affiliation: RepublicanNationality: United StatesExecutive summary: Karl Rove's favorite CatholicDeal Hudson, publisher of the Catholic news magazine Crisis, came to the attention of Karl Rove after he published an article recommending that the Republican party could garner Democratic Catholics if only the GOP would reach out to regular churchgoers. From there it was just a short hop to an informal position on George W. Bush's 2000 Presidential campaign. In his capacity as informal adviser Hudson tutored Bush on the Catholic worldview and reportedly even vetted some of his more important speeches.


In January 2003 Bush appointed Hudson to serve on the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation, along with such luminaries as Bob Dole, John Glenn, Cal Ripken, Steve Young, Cokie Roberts, Dixie Carter, Sean Astin, and Richard Parsons, among others.


Hudson originally came from academia: formerly an associate professor of philosophy at Fordham University (1989-95) and then a visiting professor of medieval studies at NYU. He also chaired the Philosophy department at Mercer University, where he taught for nine years.


It was while teaching at Fordham that Cara Poppas, one of Hudson's 18-year-old philosophy students, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the professor, claiming that he had sexual intercourse with her after she got drunk in a bar. The suit was reportedly settled out of court for $30,000, Hudson subsequently surrendered his tenure and started his life over in New York.


The incident remained quiet for ten years, until the news broke in August 2004. Hudson promptly resigned from his informal post on Bush's 2004 campaign, declaring: ""While I remain fervently committed to supporting President Bush's re-election, I think it best that I no longer play a role as an adviser in this year's campaign.""


Interestingly, in September 2003 Hudson opined that the vexatious sexual molestation crisis afflicting the Catholic church was caused by -- yes, yes: those ""predatory homosexuals"" in the priesthood -- but also a general lack of doctrinal conformity: ""I think that dissent is the major cause of the sexual abuse crisis because it has loosened priests and laity alike from their core beliefs, and particularly the core beliefs about sexual morality.""

http://www.fordhamobserver.com/s-a-g-e-s-takes-on-professor/,"This week, students began speaking out about the Theatre Department director, Matthew Maguire. The tenured professor of 25 years, who currently teaches two classes per semester and advises students, recently settled a lawsuit brought by a former assistant professor which sought damages for sex discrimination and sexual harassment.
The New York Post cited Kris Stone’s documentation as claiming that Maguire “made sure all his colleagues knew he was in an open marriage and consistently devoted ‘the first 20 minutes’ of each faculty meeting to a ‘monologue’ about sex,” as well as “[forced] ‘attractive female students’ and faculty advisers to go on dates with him,” and “required ‘some students in his acting classes to perform in class acts of rape, masturbation and molestation” and “to perform acts of simulated anal sex on stage.” According to New York Daily News, the accusations also included that Maguire talked about sex “nearly every time Stone saw [him],” “often boasted to her that he had slept with ‘hundreds of women’” and volunteered “that he had ‘masturbated with a snake.’”
Fordham University denied the allegations and called them “deliberately provocative,” saying that the denial of Stone’s reappointment inspired her suit. On Feb. 15, a $20,000 settlement was reached in Manhattan Supreme Court. It included a gag order which silences any discussion of the case by Stone, whose position was not renewed in 2014. The Fordham administration did not notify students.
Maguire is a well-known playwright, director and actor in the theatre department. A New York Times profile on his one-man autobiographical 2010 show “Wild Man” described his play as “affable, absorbing [and] buzz-inducing” and the man himself as “an appealing, talented performer.” In a rollicking Observer interview from 2010 about his one-man autobiographical show “Wild Man,” Maguire said his “drug of choice” was “lust.”
Murmurs about Maguire’s case have prompted action by students anonymously, and attention from unofficial group Students for Sex and Gender Equity and Safety Coalition (SAGES).
On March 21, article printouts were left in public areas such as the Ram Cafe and the student lounge, with headlines like “Horny professor made students simulate sex in class: lawsuit” and “Fordham University theater professor Matthew Maguire boasted about ‘masturbating with a snake,’ made students act out sex, rape scenes in class, suit charges.” This effort to increase visibility was met with curiosity and sparked discussion amongst students. One student said, “I guess somebody’s got beef with Matt,” while another exclaimed instantly, “Oh yeah, that guy’s a dick.”
Over the last few weeks, SAGES members have spoken informally with members of the student body about the settlement. “A lot of students reached out to professors individually, saying they were generally feeling unsafe,” one SAGES member said. “What they found was that a lot of professors didn’t know about it. And we found that really disturbing.”
Representatives from SAGES, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the group planned to attend a theatre department meeting on Monday, March 27. It was meant to be “a full conversation about how Title IX works, particularly with regards to the Fordham Theatre Program,” and the department email strongly advised all students in the program to come. Fordham’s Title IX Coordinator and Director of Institutional Equity and Compliance Anastasia Coleman was to be in attendance to answer questions. The morning of, the department emailed to tell would-be attendees that the Title IX Coordinator would no longer be available due to a “Title IX emergency” and that the meeting would be postponed. No date was given.
The SAGES members said they plan to engage the theatre department in a dialogue about sexual threats on campus and administrative transparency. “Now that [coverage of the settlement] seems to have died down people want to claim that there are no problems, but it doesn’t mean that students are now safe,” they said.
They also are asking the university to speak out about similar cases in future. “We’re not allowed to let other students know about what’s going on and that’s really unfortunate,” they said. “All of this comes out in student networks, like ‘Avoid this guy because he’s an abuser,’ when it should be the university sending out emails that ‘someone was assaulted on campus today.’ But we just get emails about petty theft or students who play the card games in the street. Crimes happen here. Crimes are committed by our students and crimes are committed by our faculty.”
According to the Post, the settlement included no admission of guilt by Maguire or the university. The SAGES representatives said they wanted to open discussion not because they want to say the ruling should have been different, but because they ask the school to increase transparency with student safety issues to include informing the community about student safety cases that do not fall under confidentiality rules — which would apply if the case were under Title IX. This case was filed publicly.

A George Mason University professor – and former Navy commander and FBI special agent – allegedly secretly recorded a sexual encounter with a student, according to Arlington Police.

Adjunct Professor James Feldkamp, 53, had a consenting sexual relationship with the student, but she never consented to him recording their encounters, police said.

In September, the student saw a camera inside Feldkamp’s apartment in the 3000 block of South Randolph Street and viewed video of them having sex.

He downplayed the recording like it wasn’t a big deal, and she contacted police the next day.

""We got a search warrant and found one encounter with the woman in the camera,"" said Ashley Savage of Arlington Police.

Police arrested Feldkamp in November after several weeks building a case.

Feldkamp met the student on campus, but she wasn’t one of his students at the time of the incident, Savage said.

Official documents and interviews with former team members open a window onto Pober’s fall from prominence at the school.Those documents include written testimony that details allegations about an episode in February involving the professor and the student, who graduated in the spring.In an interview, the man who wrote that testimony said he was coming forward out of concern that Pober might be able to move to a position at another school.“He still has one of the best résumés of any coach in the country, in terms of both competitive success and just sheer experience,” he said. “I truly felt as though he was going to end up with another job in education and do the same thing to other people as he did to me.”The allegations against the George Mason professor come amid a larger national conversation about sexual harassment and misconduct that has reverberated across the academy and industries including entertainment, media and technology. A central concern involves harassers who were able to hide in plain sight, sometimes moving from one job to another.In his written testimony, the man alleged that Pober made sexual advances. The encounter allegedly happened while the two were alone in a hotel room after a night of heavy drinking, according to the documents.The Washington Post generally does not identify victims of sexual misconduct unless they voluntarily offer their names to be published. The man asked that his name not be published because the behavior in question was not his own.The man filed a Title IX harassment complaint with the school, and university officials found enough information to support his allegation “that Dr. Pober engaged in conduct that qualifies as Sexual or Gender-Based Harassment” in violation of university policy, those documents show.The man turned the records over to The Post. George Mason did not release records from its investigation, but a university spokesman confirmed that the documents supplied by the student were authentic.“During the investigation, Dr. Pober confirmed that he told you that [he] wanted to have sexual intercourse with you,” a letter explaining the school’s findings states.Pober acknowledged in a statement to The Post that he had an “inappropriate conversation” with a student, though he denied some of what was allegedly said during the incident.“I admit that in February 2018 I had an inappropriate conversation with a student on a school trip, although I continue to deny several of the allegations regarding the content of that conversation,” Pober said in the statement, which was provided by his attorney. “I apologized to the student that evening and continue to regret my words.”Pober, who did not have tenure, retired in May, after the school started “termination for cause proceedings,” university spokesman Michael Sandler said in a statement.Retirement benefits are regarded as personnel records, Sandler said, meaning the university cannot discuss financial details of Pober’s departure. Pober’s attorney declined to share details of her client’s retirement.Former team members described Pober as brilliant but demanding, a powerful and respected leader in collegiate speech. He had been a university employee since 2003 and had served as chair of the Faculty Senate.The man who said he was harassed by Pober was a member of the speech team at the time of the incident.“George Mason University takes enforcement of Title IX very seriously,” Sandler said, referring to the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in schools that receive federal funding. “The university thoroughly investigates Title IX complaints, and when there is evidence of violations, it takes appropriate action.”The documents the man provided to The Post show that George Mason took “swift, decisive action on this matter,” Sandler said in a statement, which noted that an investigation continues.George Mason did not have a record of complaints against Pober before February, Sandler said, but after it received the initial allegation, university officials received “several other complaints.” Pober was placed on administrative leave, and the university ordered him to stop interacting with students.A letter provided by the former student shows that George Mason decided to place Pober on administrative leave in mid-February.“I have always considered myself a teacher,” Pober said in his statement. “As difficult as it was to decide to retire from GMU, that decision was the right one for the university and its forensics program.”One of the other complaints about Pober came from a former member of George Mason’s speech team — known as the forensics team — who alleged Pober made a sexual advance, though the incident happened after the man graduated. The man said he met with Pober expecting to discuss a coaching role.“During what was supposed to be a business dinner, Dr. Pober purchased several drinks for the two of us, made unwanted sexual advances once I was intoxicated, and then the next morning claimed he didn’t remember what happened,” the man said in a statement to The Post. He spoke on the condition of anonymity because of privacy concerns.The man, who said he later worked as a coach for George Mason’s team, filed a complaint with the university in March, three years after the alleged incident.He said he did not initially come forward because he did not believe he had grounds to ask George Mason to act — he was neither a university employee at the time nor a student. He decided to share his experience after learning that someone else had filed a complaint.The second man provided a letter showing that the school found enough evidence to support his harassment allegation. The university confirmed the authenticity of the letter.The Post spoke with the man’s roommate, who lived with him at the time of the alleged incident and still does. She said that after the man returned from meeting with Pober, he told her the professor had made sexual advances.Pober’s attorney provided redacted letters about investigations into two other cases. In those instances, the letters show, the university did not find enough evidence to support allegations of harassment. The university verified that those documents were authentic.The forensics team, which focuses on public speaking, “is a success story at Mason,” Sandler said. “We are committed to the program and have made it a priority.”The man who alleged being harassed in February acknowledged having a rocky student-professor relationship with Pober. The alleged incident happened in New Orleans after a competition elsewhere in Louisiana, according to the former student’s account of the night.Team members attended a dinner in the French Quarter, which included “a generous amount of drinks,” the man’s written Title IX testimony states. They made stops at bars as the night progressed, and the now-former student started to notice how much Pober was touching him, according to the written testimony. At one bar, he wrote, he and Pober slow danced.“I thought it was a little too intimate, so I broke away relatively quickly,” the man’s testimony states. “He stared at me for awhile afterwards and smiled. He bought me another drink.”The alleged incident in the hotel room happened in the early morning hours. The man, who wrote that he was “still far from sober,” described moments he said he remembered, including Pober telling him he loved him and had been watching him all night.The man thought Pober was trying to pay him a compliment, but then noticed a shift in tone, as the professor became more flirtatious. Eventually, the student alleged in his testimony, Pober told him that he had been wanting to have sex with him for years, and continued to make sexual advances, at times using graphic language.“As he pointed at the bed, I cautiously told him I had no interest,” the written testimony states.The conversation lasted longer than an hour, the now-former student said in a telephone interview, because he was wary of suggesting to Pober that the encounter was strange. He did not want to seem combative, he said, but wanted to make clear he wanted no part in what Pober was suggesting.“I wish I had left,” he said in his written testimony. “I wish I had told him he was out of line and stormed out. He continually acknowledged he was out of line and then kept pushing, and I kept wishing this would turn into something different.”The man left the hotel room, saying he needed to sleep. In the documents, he alleged that Pober adjusted his jacket as he left, swore at him and said: “I was planning on taking advantage of you. But you had to take control.”“He laughed, so I pretended it was a joke, too,” he wrote. “I told him good night, I went back to my room, and I had a panic attack.”The complaint was investigated by the school’s office on compliance, diversity and ethics, documents indicate. In addition to the sexual harassment matter, Pober also violated George Mason’s drug and alcohol policy for employees, because of “substantial impairment brought on by excessive alcohol consumption” while he was performing official duties, according to a university letter provided by a former student.Three former members of the team who were on the trip provided similar accounts of a drunken night out. The three were not witnesses to what is alleged to have occurred in the hotel room but learned details from their teammate.They included one woman who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the issue. She said she waited outside the door while her teammate and Pober were inside, and learned what happened through text messages and a conversation with her teammate not long afterward.“For men in power who are sexually exploiting people that are under them, your time is up,” she said. “This can’t keep happening.”"

Photo credit: A former Georgia State University English professor can never again set foot on campus after a school investigation found on June 9 that the teacher “engaged in inappropriate conduct of a sexual nature” with a student.


 Terry Bozeman, who taught at Georgia State’s Perimeter College in Dunwoody, came under scrutiny after being 0700806 with sexual battery on April 19. The mother of one of his students told campus police that her daughter was “sexually assaulted” by the 43-year-old professor, according to a GSUPD report. The victim claimed “Bozeman told her to lift up her shirt and...touched her in the buttocks area,” the arrest report says.


 Bozeman said in a police witness statement that he touched his student’s rear during a hug after “light-hearted, joking conversation” in his office. “We jokingly talked about having lunch next week, and when done I gave the student a playful hug. During the hug, I lightly touched the student’s bottom.”


 Although the school’s Title IX investigators — administration officials who work to prevent discrimination in schools — said the June 9 judgement against Bozeman would have prompted his termination, the English teacher had already resigned on April 26, the same day another student filed a complaint with GSUPD alleging that Bozeman also touched her in a sexual manner.


 “With a heavy heart, I do what’s right for my family, my team, and ultimately the institution I love so dearly,” Bozeman wrote in his resignation letter, which made no reference to the allegations against him. Creative Loafing has been unable to reach Bozeman, who in 2014 was named a Governor’s Teaching Fellow, for comment.


 The second student told university police that Bozeman had “lured her” into his Dunwoody campus office on three separate occasions from Jan. 11 to April 19. There, the GSUPD report says,  “Bozeman convinced her he needed near-nude photographs of her to send to his modeling connections.”


 “Bozeman took photographs with his cell phone from the front, back, and both sides,” the April 26 police report states. “He asked her to pull up her bra so he could touch her breasts to obtain her measurements.”


 University police handed over the woman’s complaint to Georgia State’s human resources office, although she wasn’t personally involved in the investigation thereafter.


 After the seven-week Title IX investigation prompted by his April 19 sexual battery arrest, and using the second student’s April 26 police report as further evidence, the university found Bozeman guilty of misconduct on June 9. The school’s staff handbook says: “People in positions of authority within the university community must be sensitive to the potential for conflict of interest as well as sexual harassment in amorous relationships with people over whom they have a professional power/status advantage.”


 Although Bozeman’s photo subject told police that she consented to his sexual advances, the first complainant said she did not, and the school decided his behavior breached policies of “equal opportunity, amorous relationships, sexual harassment, and employee conduct,” according to the notice of the infraction that Georgia State sent to Bozeman.


 Because of the Title IX violation, Bozeman is prohibited from working at Georgia State and barred from all university properties and school-sanctioned events. The sexual battery case was handed off to the DeKalb County Police Department after the April 19 arrest, and a court date has not been scheduled.

https://www.statesboroherald.com/local/serna-sentenced-to-a-year-in-jail/,"
                Georgia Southern University associate professor Dr. Juan Serna, convicted in January of sexual and drug offenses against a former student, faces a year in jail.    Bulloch County Superior Court Judge William Woodrum sentenced Serna, 46, to two concurrent sentences of 12 months each, and gave him a choice of whether to serve the time in the Bulloch County Jail or Bulloch County Correctional Institute, according to Sherri Akins, Bulloch County clerk of courts.    After a three-day  trial, jurors deliberated for a total of four and a half hours before finding Serna innocent of the charge of aggravated sodomy, a felony, but guilty  of sexual battery, possession of a dangerous drug, and furnishing alcohol to underage persons, which are misdemeanors.    During the trial the victim said Serna used  ""Amsterdam Poppers,"" to  render him defenseless before forcing himself upon him.    Serna told jurors the sexual encounter was consensual.    Amsterdam poppers is a chemical labeled as amyl nitrate but tested by Georgia Bureau of Investigation chemists as alkyl nitrite, an illegal drug, to aid his advances towards the victim.    The victim testified Serna waved the drug under his nose and it rendered him unable to speak and resist Serna's advances. Two other witnesses, who did not know the victim, testified Serna offered the same chemical to them in 2003,  and described similarities in the way Serna invited them to his home and showed them pornography in what they felt was an effort to have sex with them.    The victim testified Serna did the same thing to him in 2005, months before a party April 28/29 when the sexual assault occurred.    A third witness, also a former student, testified against Serna as well, describing events taking place in Costa Rica during a class trip.

                                Among presiding Justice Harris Hines' numerous state positions since his admittance to the State Bar of Georgia in 1968, he can now add Chief Justice to his list of achievements.Hines is taking over the role from current Chief Justice Hugh P. Thompson in January 2017, though his term officially ends in August, according to a press release. At the same time, Justice Harold D. Melton will assume Hines’s position.Jan Hansen, the public information officer for the Supreme Court of Georgia, said Hines was unanimously voted to the position based on his seniority and experience.“I can assure you he is very humbled and pleased on the selection by his fellow colleagues,” Hansen said.According to the press release, Thompson encourages the transition in order to provide Hines adequate experience as Chief Justice before his retirement in 2018.The experience will arrive readily, with 11 upcoming cases due for oral argument before the court this week.Some of the cases deal with land ownership and worker’s compensation, while one case in particular, Wolfe V. Regents of the University System of Georgia, has the attention of many.Lorne Wolfe, a tenured professor at the Georgia Southern University, is appealing a Fulton County Court ruling that upholds his termination after the alleged sexual harassment of a female graduate student.According to a press release, Wolfe made an inappropriate comment toward the student when she spilled coffee on herself. When she rebuffed his remarks, he reportedly spoke loudly and inappropriately with another student regarding her physical appearance.The appeal is based on the university incorrectly applying the legal standard when firing Wolfe. By only being charged with “hostile environment sexual harassment,” Wolfe claims ignorance regarding his statements being grounds for hostile environment.Because Wolfe is a tenured professor, the university is prohibited from taking corrective action against him unless his behavior is so offensive it makes the university liable.The appeal is scheduled to appear before Hines on Tuesday Sept. 13, at which time the justices ""will be researching the law, writing opinions and will be spending that time looking at the facts of the case and applying the law to the case,” Hansen said.

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/03/grcc_professor_resigns_after_s.html,"(MLive File Photo)GRAND RAPIDS, MI - A longtime Grand Rapids Community College professor, accused of repeatedly kissing a student against her will, resigned the same day he learned school officials would recommend his firing for sexual misconduct, according to documents released by the college.A GRCC investigation, prompted by a student complaint, determined humanities professor Harold Lee violated the school's sexual misconduct policiesLee had been on paid suspension since Dec. 18, 2015, pending the outcome of the investigation. The school later determined Lee had violated two policies, including sexual  assault - which includes non-consensual sexual touching - and those governing relationships with students or subordinates.Lee repeatedly kissed a student on the mouth after they met off-campus for a meal and drinks on Dec.11, according to information obtained from GRCC through a Freedom of Information Act request. Lee later admitted to school officials that their third and last kiss ""felt weird.""""Lee admitted that he kissed (name redacted) three times over the course of several minutes. Lee admitted that he had no indication this behavior was welcome, and that nothing (redacted) ... did encouraged the kisses.,"" according to school documents.Lee faces no criminal charges from the unwanted kissing, authorities said.The kissing followed a meeting off-campus at a local bar in which Lee and the student had a meal and alcoholic drinks. Lee acknowledged that he drank three or four beers, but claims he would not have engaged in the behavior had he not been drinking.Prior to the three unwanted kisses, the student told the school she felt very uncomfortable at the bar because Lee was sharing ""disgusting details"" about his personal life, including about an addiction to pornography and affairs he'd engaged in previously, documents show.He made multiple calls that night to the student and his number was later blocked.
The student initially thought they were meeting for coffee to discuss another matter, but agreed to the meal after Lee said he was starving.Lee resigned Jan. 8, the same day he was notified that GRCC planned to bring charges against him to the Board of Trustees. The school planned to recommend his immediate termination at the Jan. 25 meeting.GRCC's sexual misconduct policy states, in part:GRCC also said that even if officials assumed Lee's relationship was consensual, his conduct was explicitly prohibited under the policy prohibiting consensual relationships.Lee's behavior ""was harassing, caused embarrassment, and was sexual,"" according to the Corrective Action Notice drawn up by the school. At one point, Lee had described the kiss as ""not sexual,"" but the student said it was sexual, adding ""he tried to use his tongue. I could feel it around my mouth.""The college newspaper, The Collegiate, first reported Lee's resignation.Lee has not been charged with any crime related to this case, police have said.GRCC reports this was not an isolated incident. In its Jan. 8 letter to Lee, they say he acknowledged prior incidents in which he engaged in inappropriate sexual activity related to his employment:• A sexual involvement while at Montcalm Community College, resulting in his resignation in lieu of termination.• Admission to a Kent County Sheriff's Department officer of an incident while in his faculty office at GRCC.Monica Scott is the Grand Rapids K-12 education writer.

                Last June, Jonathan Hatch,  former associate professor of mathematics, was arrested and charged for allegedly using a miniature digital camera built inside a pen to take up-skirt photos of a student at the college.
Federal authorities say that Hatch, 44, pled guilty to felony peeping tom charges, and was sentenced in state and federal courts in April.
According a spokesperson for Greensboro’s U.S Attorney’s Office, Hatch was sentenced to 66 months in federal prison followed by 20 years probation.
Hatch also faced similar charges at the state level, and was given a suspended sentence by the State of North Carolina, according to a spokesperson for the Guilford County District Attorney’s office.
“He will have to file as a sex offender once he completes his federal sentence,” the spokesperson said.
Following an investigation into Hatch’s home computer, authorities found hundreds of photos of minors in sexually suggestive positions, which prompted a federal investigation, according to court documents.
Hatch, who is being held at the Federal Correctional Institution at Fort Dix, New Jersey, resigned from Guilford as allegations of his actions were made public.

http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180131/ex-harper-professor-charged-in-shooting-twice-disciplined-over-sexual-harassment,"
																An ex-Harper College professor charged with shooting at vehicles and police in Iowa earlier this month was disciplined by the college twice in recent years, including a three-day suspension stemming from students' sexual harassment complaints, records obtained Wednesday show.
									Charles Johnston, an associate psychology professor fired last week by the college's board, was admonished by administrators at the Palatine community college in late 2014 after allegations were leveled by two female students, according to documents provided by Harper through a Freedom of Information Act request.

									The first student filed a complaint with the college Sept. 26, 2014, in which she said Johnston solicited her by email for a sexual relationship. In one message, Johnston told her, ""You must molest me metaphorically or really in some way,"" documents state.
									A second student who filed a complaint Oct. 1, 2014, said the professor sent sexually harassing messages by email and text in an effort to meet up with her.
									Johnston admitted sending the messages but was allowed to keep his job after serving a three-day suspension without pay and undergoing a psychiatric assessment by a doctor selected by the college. Johnston, Harper's provost and the college's faculty senate president signed the Dec. 4, 2014, agreement keeping him at the college.
									The three-page document, titled ""Last Chance Agreement,"" stated it was a ""final warning"" for his continued employment.
									Days after admitting to sending the messages, Johnston went on paid leave, including 12 weeks of leave approved under the Family and Medical Leave Act. Johnston was to serve the three-day suspension afterward and then be on paid administrative leave pending completion and review of the psychiatric exam, according to the agreement.

									He was cleared to return to work Feb. 10, 2015, Harper officials said Wednesday, though they did not provide a copy of the exam.
									Then in July 2017, Johnston again faced discipline in the form of a written reprimand from the college provost. It came after Johnston sent an email harshly critical of a co-worker to 16 colleagues, and alleging his contractual rights were violated during a student grade dispute.
									""You stated that you were interested in providing the facts to everyone so that there would not be hallway conversations,"" Provost Judith Marwick wrote. ""I think this email has quite the opposite effect and the personal criticisms of a colleague are inappropriate.""
									Johnston also complained in the email that it was wrong for a colleague to contact him about the grade complaint before he had spoken with the student. But Marwick said the proper protocols were followed; the student was unable to contact Johnston, having emailed him twice and gone to his office twice over a nine-day period.
									Marwick also cited other issues with Johnston's work, including discrepancies between grades he submitted to his dean and those listed in the college's new grading software, and with Johnston submitting midterm verifications -- whether a student is still attending class or not -- three weeks late.
	
									Johnston asserted he was having problems with the new software.
									On Sept. 10 last year, one of Johnston's family members wrote an email to college officials stating she was scheduled to take him to the doctor. The next day, he went on leave again through the Family and Medical Leave Act due to ""a personal illness,"" according to a memo written by the college's benefits and compensation manager.
									In a Sept. 14 email provided to the Daily Herald by a former student, Johnston told students he suffered a minor stroke or an ""extreme stress reaction.""
									He told officers after his arrest he was recently hospitalized and had been taking several prescription drugs, according to a court filing.
									Johnston reported back to work Jan. 11 for the first day of faculty attendance for the spring 2018 semester, Harper records show. But later that afternoon Iowa authorities say Johnston shot at vehicles and exchanged gunfire with state troopers near Interstate 80 in Cedar County, between Iowa City and the Quad Cities.
									Johnston, charged with attempted murder and assault on a peace officer with a dangerous weapon, told police he targeted truck drivers after becoming enraged over a truck crash that killed a family, according to court filings.
									A Harper employee since 1996, Johnson was barred from campus after college officials learned of his arrest, then fired by a unanimous vote of the board Jan. 23.
									Johnston, 60, of Belvidere, is being held in the Cedar County jail on $1 million bail and is due in court for an arraignment March 2.

He has been extradited to Delaware and as of Friday was being held at Young Correctional Institution in lieu of $6,000 bail.Shaffer, who is no longer a HACC faculty member, had a brief relationship with one of his female students at HACC's Harrisburg campus in 2006, according to state Trooper Richard Drum of the Eastern District U.S. Marshal Fugitive Task Force, which made the arrest.Drum, citing a police affidavit for the arrest warrant, said judging by text messages, phone calls and e-mails Shaffer sent to the woman, the three-month relationship in 2006 had been sexual.""He was told, 'Hey, knock it off!' "" Drum said. But Shaffer persisted, even after the woman transferred to the University of Delaware.""Some of the e-mails had led her to believe that he was coming down there to do something,"" said Drum. ""She got to the point where she feared for her own safety.""University police even had to provide a security detail at the woman's graduation ceremonies, he said.Shaffer, who is not married, last taught at HACC's Lancaster campus last fall, according to HACC spokeswoman Pam Saylor.

http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/6/8/professor-scolded-for-harrassment-in-december/,"In December 1979, for the first time in Harvard history, the University officially reprimanded a faculty member for sexual harassment, sparking an increase in the number of complaints about inappropriate relations pursued towards female undergraduates by the faculty.Helene S. York ’83 filed a sexual harassment complaint against Professor of Government Martin L. Kilson on Nov. 15, 1979 for trying to kiss her while she attended his office hours, where, according to York, she was seeking advice on a paper topic.More students spoke up and sought advice about dealing with sexual harassment following York’s case. However, no more formal complaints had been filed by the end of the school year, causing some to question Harvard’s commitment to dealing with sexual harrassment.Then-Dean of the Faculty Henry A. Rosovsky censured Kilson after the sexual harassment complaint came to light, asking him to write an apology letter to York. Kilson took a sick leave from the College during the spring term of 1980.Furthermore, Rosovsky warned Kilson that if he repeated the offense, his tenure could be revoked by the Harvard Corporation.“I did commit an act of impropriety, as I was fully aware,” Kilson told The Crimson in December 1979.But he added that he did not intend to offend York. He said that it was “a valid perception” that his acts be seen as sexual harassment, but said he believed she misinterpreted his purpose. As he added, “my general affectionate air could be misinterpreted.”During a Kennedy School of Government forum in May 1980, many women asked Judith B. Walzer­—who served as assistant dean of the College for coeducation and the administrator who handles sexual harassment complaints—to explain the obscure policies over reporting sexual harassment.In response, Walzer said she would ensure the University publicizes the procedures more carefully. Subsequently, Walzer recommended to Dean of Harvard College John B. Fox that the University clarify its definition of “sexual harassment” and publicize it in the student handbook.Jennifer L. Pensler ’80, who served as president of the Radcliffe Union of Students during her college years, recalls that sexual harassment was an important issue during her time on campus.“I met with Judith Walzer and there wasn’t a place to go to make a complaint, no clear guidelines,” she said.Problems with dealing with sexual harassment and women’s issues remained.Dean Fox admitted in a June 5, 1980 article in The Crimson that for the 1979-1980 school year, he “forgot to remind all of the [house] masters to hire a women’s adviser.”Furthermore, Fox’s decision not to label women’s advisers as such made them much more difficult to seek out, possibly causing many students not to report cases of sexual harassment.—Staff writer Bari M. Schwartz can be reached at bschwart@fas.harvard.edu"
http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1983/9/28/harvard-disciplines-professor-for-sexual-harassment/,"Harvard has taken disciplinary action against a tenured Government professor for sexually harassing a junior faculty member in the department, Government professors confirmed this week.Jorge I. Dominguez, Harvard's senior authority on Latin American political science, was officially punished this summer by Dean of the Faculty Henry Rosovsky, after the dean found merit in a grievance the assistant professor lodged.Dominguez has been in Mexico City this week attending a conference, according to a note on his office door.  He could not be reached for comment yesterday.Professors and graduate students who discussed the incident declined to identify the assistant professor who filed the grievance.  They said she was out of the country this week.Rosovsky's apparent punitive action follows a Government graduate student's grievance that she was also sexually harassed by Dominguez.  The student filed her complaint after the assistant professor's.The incidents mark only the third time that disciplinary action against a Harvard professor for sexual harassment has come to light.  The other two cases involved isolated incidents between a professor and student.The assistant professor's grievance reportedly described episodes of both verbal harassment and physical contact by Dominguez that persisted for at least a year.Rosovsky, in a letter to the graduate student, wrote, ""I regret very much the discomfort you have experienced in your relationship with Professor Dominguez.  Your statement has been helpful in evaluating other allegations of his abuse of authority and deciding what action should be taken by me.""Rosovsky refused to discuss Dominguez's case yesterday.  Professors said he spoke about the case at a special Government faculty meeting held Monday night to discuss sexual harassment, but the dean did not disclose what measures he took against Dominguez.Dominguez was recently replaced as chairman of an interdisciplinary Latin American studies committee.The new chairman, Juan Marichal, Smith Professor of the French and Spanish Languages and Literatures, said yesterday a Faculty administrator asked him to assume the post because of a ""serious situation"" concerning Dominguez.Professors said Dominguez was stripped of his post as punishment by Rosovsky for the alleged sexual harassment.  The Crimson was unable to obtain any official confirmation of this fact.Some professors said they were unhappy Rosovsky did not tell the department members what actions he took against Dominguez and complained that the reported punishment was too light.""There's some feeling that the fact that there was supposed to be no publicity and the fact that he is still here are an inadequate deterrent for the future and an inadequate punishment for this case,"" one professor said.The professor added:  ""There are a lot of us who feel that in some ways, the University is more concerned with its reputation than with the proper adjudication of a very serious matter.""At Monday's Government faculty meeting, the department unanimously adopted a resolution deploring sexual harassment and pledging to ensure that incidents of sexual harassment do not occur, professors said.Dominguez apparently did not attend the meeting.  He is expected to return to Harvard next week.  One Government professor said that some department members were considering proposing that Dominguez be forbidden from attending faculty meetings in the future, as additional punishment.The graduate student's complaint stated that Dominguez made repeated off-color or paternalistic remarks and, on one occasion a pass at her.According to Faculty policy, formal harassment complaints are investigated by an administrator and submitted to Rosovsky for a final decision.  Cases involving two professors may also be reviewed by an  hoc Faculty committee.The policy stipulates that complainants are told whether their case is found to have merit but are not notified what action is taken against the subject of the complaint.The most recent publicized case of sexual harassment by a professor took place in Spring 1982.Rosovsky wrote that he found merit in a complaint of sexual harassment filed by a freshman woman against a visiting professor in the English Department.  He wrote a letter to the professor admonishing him and the Administrative Board later allowed the student to change her grade for the course from a ""C"" to ""pass.""That case prompted a major review of the Faculty's procedures for handling sexual harassment cases by Rosovsky's steering committee of professors, the Faculty Council.  The council eventually made no changes in the procedures.The incident also helped spark a broad survey of undergraduates, graduate students and Faculty members concerning sexual harassment.  The results will be released later this fall.In December 1979, Rosovsky reprimanded a Government professor for making advances to a freshman woman, and threatened that if the professor repeated the action, the woman would go before the Corporation, which has the power to revoke tenure.Dominguez is listed in the course catalogue as teaching two graduate courses this semester:  a seminar in comparative politics and a class in U.S. -Latin American relations.He received a B.A. from Yale in 1967, and obtained his Ph.D. at Harvard in 1972.Michael W. Miller helped prepare this story."

Hennekens resigned from his posts at HMS and Brigham and Women's Hospital, where he was the chief of the Division of Preventive Medicine, effective on March 31.Both organizations confirmed Hennekens' resignation but said in a joint statement that ""due to issues of employee confidentiality, no further information is available at this time.""Hennekens lawyer, Joel A. Kozol, told reporters that Hennekens had left the posts to be near his ill mother in Florida, according to the Globe.But his departure also came six weeks after employees in his division told lawyers for Harvard and the hospital that Hennekens had harassed several female members of the department, the Globe said.According to the Globe, lawyers from Harvard and the hospital investigated the complaints against Hennekens and confronted him with the allegations.Hennekens issued a statement through his lawyer to the Globe denying the accusations.""In today's world, allegations of sexual harassment are easily made and difficult to disprove. When they are made by people who are unwilling to be identified, they are not worthy of response, much less publication,"" read the statement which was printed in the Globe.""...I have never in my life sexually harassed anyone in the division or anywhere else. Those who know me know this to be true,"" the statement continued.The women said Hennekens made unwanted sexual advances, and some claimed that their careers suffered after they rejected his propositions, according to the Globe.Others said that while sexual advances were made, their professional careers were not threatened when they rejected them.The Globe's sources for the story--three people who worked under Hennekens' supervision--spoke to the newspaper about the allegations on condition of anonymity.""He would make a sexual advance to someone or in some cases, like in my situation it was an explicit sexual proposition in which the sexual nature of his request was completely clear"" one of the sources told the Globe. ""I was extremely fearful of the consequences of rejecting his. From that point forward my work suffered. He blocked whatever I tried to do.""During his career Hennekens has co-authorized more that 500 publications and three textbooks.As the principal investigator in the physician's Health Study, he also made discoveries that were widely noted in the media, including the  aspirin study.He also served as founding editor-in-chief of the Annals of Epidemiology and the editor-in-chief of the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.Hennekens earned his M.D. from Cornell University and a masters of public health from Harvard.He was Brawnwald professor of medicine and ambulatory care and prevention at HMS and a professor in the department of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, a post which he has also resigned from.Neither Hennekens nor his lawyer could be reached for comment yesterday."
http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2018/1/5/medical-school-professor-sexual-harassment/,"Facing accusations of sexual misconduct, physician and longtime Harvard Medical School professor Harvey J. Makadon resigned from his positions on the faculty at the Medical School and staff of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center last month.Makadon, who had taught at the Medical School for decades, was accused of misconduct by several men, including World Bank health policy strategist Armin Fidler. Fidler claims that Makadon made unwanted advances toward him in 1990, while Fidler was a student at the Harvard School of Public Health, the Boston Globe reported Monday. He wrote to Harvard to report the alleged misconduct in November.Fidler declined to comment for this story.Gary R. Brissette, a Chestnut Hill doctor who completed his residency at Beth Israel, alleged that Makadon inappropriately touched him in the early 1990s. Another man, a patient who saw Makadon for treatment in the late 1980s, also claims that Makadon sexually harassed him.In an interview Wednesday, Makadon repeatedly denied sexual harassment claims made by Fidler and others.“I have no recollection of Dr. Fidler and I certainly did not behave in the way that he described,” he said.Makadon stepped down from his post at Beth Israel on Dec. 8, when the allegations came to light. According to Medical School spokesperson Gina Vild, Makadon’s faculty position at the Medical School was based on his hospital appointment, so when Makadon resigned from Beth Israel, his Harvard appointment ended simultaneously.Vild declined to comment on Makadon’s individual case.  “While we are not able to discuss specific cases, be assured that we take every concern reported to us extremely seriously,” she said.Makadon served as an LGBT advisor during his time as clinical professor of medicine at the Medical School. He also formerly worked at Fenway Health, a medical center specializing in the treatment of LGBT individuals, before he was forced to resign amid allegations that he had sexually harassed and bullied coworkers.The Boston Globe reported that formal complaints made at Fenway Health against Makadon dated back to 2013. Twice since then, Fenway Health commissioned external law firms to investigate the allegations against Makadon. One of these investigations, in 2015, recommended Makadon be fired.Makadon’s resignations come as a national movement has brought heightened attention to the issue of workplace harassment and toppled powerful men in Hollywood, government, media, and the corporate world. The movement has prompted more individuals to come forward with stories of harassment, and Harvard has seen a 20 percent increase in sexual harassment complaints since it began.—Staff writer Luke W.

				Sociologist Steven M. Cohen, one of the foremost experts on contemporary Judaism, has resigned from his position as tenured professor at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion following an internal investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.Last month, several women accused Cohen of sexual misconduct in an article in The New York Jewish Week. HUC launched a Title IX investigation into the allegations, which came from women who have worked with Cohen or associated professionally with him.In a statement Wednesday announcing his resignation, Hebrew Union College explained that it had “received several complaints of sexual misconduct by Dr. Cohen and commenced an internal investigation. Dr. Cohen did not dispute some of the conduct alleged.”HUC said it would not comment on specific allegations.Earlier, Cohen resigned from his position as director of the Berman Jewish Policy Archive, a research database at Stanford University. At about the same time, he was removed from his position as a board member of New Voices, a magazine for Jewish college students.The claims of inappropriate behavior against Cohen, a research professor of Jewish social policy, span decades. They include inappropriate touching and grabbing, sexual propositions and advances, and inappropriate sexual remarks.Cohen did not deny the allegations and apologized for them in a statement to The Jewish Week in July.Through countless papers, opinion pieces, speeches and books, Cohen’s research and interpretations have shaped how the organized Jewish community views itself and sets its priorities. Cohen directed numerous community and Jewish population surveys, including the 2011 Jewish Community Study of New York, and was a consultant to the influential 2013 Pew study of American Jews.Sociologist Steven M. Cohen resigns from Hebrew Union College following sexual harassment investigation

https://casetext.com/case/garner-v-state-comn-of-ethics,"   No. 82-2619.   September 14, 1983. Rehearing Denied October 31, 1983.    Appeal from the Commission on Ethics.     Joseph C. Jacobs and Dean Bunch of Ervin, Varn, Jacobs, Odom Kitchen, Tallahassee, for appellant.   Jim Smith, Atty. Gen., Patricia R. Gleason, Asst. Atty. Gen., Tallahassee, and Philip C. Claypool, Staff Atty., Com'n on Ethics, Tallahassee, for appellee.       LEHAN, Judge.   Complaints were filed with the Florida Commission on Ethics (the ""Commission"") against appellant alleging that he corruptly used or attempted to use his official position as president of Hillsborough Community College to sexually harass or obtain sexual favors from various female subordinate personnel and that such behavior constituted a violation of section 112.313(6), Florida Statutes (1981). After finding that the complaints were legally sufficient, conducting an investigation, finding probable cause to proceed, and charging appellant with five instances of the foregoing conduct, the Commission conducted an extensive hearing. Following that hearing, the Commission entered a final order which contained findings of fact and law sustaining the charges and which recommended that appellant be suspended from office for three months. In re Ambrose Garner, 5 F.A.L.R. 105-A (Jan. 24, 1983). Appellant appeals that order of the Commission. We affirm.   One of appellant's contentions on appeal is that section 112.313(6) is unconstitutional as applied in this case. Appellant previously raised the issue of the constitutionality of that section by reason of asserted vagueness when he sought injunctive relief to prevent the Commission from proceeding on the complaints filed against him. The Circuit Court of the Second Judicial Circuit denied injunctive relief, and the First District Court of Appeal affirmed. The First District found that the allegations against appellant were within the jurisdiction of the Commission under section 112.313(6) and that section 112.313(6) is not unconstitutionally vague. Garner v. Florida Commission on Ethics, 415 So.2d 67 (Fla. 1st DCA 1982), pet. for review denied, 424 So.2d 761 (Fla. 1983). We have carefully considered appellant's arguments to the contrary but believe that that determination by the First District, which became the law of this case, is not incorrect and that section 112.313(6) was not unconstitutional as applied.   Section 112.313(6) provides that ""No public officer or employee of an agency shall corruptly use or attempt to use his official position . . . to secure a special privilege, benefit, or exemption for himself or others."" Section 112.313(7) defines ""corruptly"" as ""done with a wrongful intent and for the purpose of obtaining . . . any benefit resulting from some act or omission of a public servant which is inconsistent with the proper performance of his public duties.""   Appellant contends that the statute did not give adequate notice that sexual harassment, with which he was charged, was prohibited; that the statute is intended to cover only economic benefit; and that, since there were no adverse job-related effects upon employees who were allegedly subjected to Appellant's conduct, a requisite nexus between the alleged conduct and such effects was not shown. However, the charges included the obtaining of sexual favors, which we cannot say are not ""any benefit"" within the generally understood meaning of the term and the receipt of which was, in this context within the foregoing definition of ""corruptly,"" inconsistent with the performance of official duties. Also, no legislative intent to restrict the reach of the statute to economic benefits appears. See Tenney v. Commission on Ethics, 395 So.2d 1244 (Fla. 2d DCA 1981). In addition, the statute does not specifically require that as a result of a public officer's efforts to obtain a benefit from an employee, that employee will necessarily be impacted in any particular way. In any event, appellant's conduct was shown to have been incident to appellant's official position; as to one of the incidents there was evidence which, while strongly contested, could have supported a finding that the uncooperative recipient of sexual advances lost her job as the result of that lack of cooperation.   Pursuant to section 120.68, Florida Statutes (1981), we have reviewed the record and the Commission's order which found that the alleged conduct occurred in the five alleged instances and that various other instances of that type of conduct had previously occurred. We cannot hold that there was not competent substantial evidence  in the record to support the findings of the Commission, specifically the finding that the alleged acts constituted use of appellant's official position to obtain benefits inconsistent with the proper performance of his official duties.   We have also considered appellant's other contentions and find them to be without merit.   AFFIRMED.   DANAHY, A.C.J., and CAMPBELL, J., concur.   "

Amy BURTNER, Plaintiff,
v.
Hiram COLLEGE, et al., Defendants.
No. 5:96-CV-1355.
United States District Court, N.D. Ohio, Eastern Division.
June 26, 1998.
*853 Nancy C. Schuster, Patricia Koch Windham, Schuster  Simmons, Cleveland, OH, for Plaintiff.
Thomas H. Barnard, Jr., Lawrence D. Pollack, Kimberly Brown Schroeder, Ulmer  Berne, Cleveland, OH, Barry R. Laine, Dennis Haines, Green, Haines, Sgambati, Murphy  Macala, Youngstown, OH, Defendants. 
MEMORANDUM OPINION
GWIN, District Judge.
On April 27, 1998 the Defendant Hiram College filed a motion for summary judgment in this sexual harassment lawsuit arising from a relationship between a student and professor at the Ohio liberal arts college [Doc. 106]. On May 27, 1998, after seeking leave of Court, Plaintiff Amy Burtner filed another motion for summary judgment [Docs. 109, 124].
This court must now decide whether Hiram College should be held responsible for the professor's conduct. The defendant school argues it should not be liable for harassment which it did not know existed and which Burtner, if her allegations are true, failed to bring to Hiram's attention until she was awarded her diploma. Further, Hiram College argues it cannot be liable since it took prompt remedial action once it was notified of the harassment.
The Court acknowledges that the perspective from which the parties argue their motions and present evidence has changed since the parties filed their papers. Still, the Court finds the evidence they have adduced is sufficient for the Court to render judgment in the wake of the Supreme Court's recent decision in Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, ___ U.S. ___, 118 S. Ct. 1989, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1998).
After examining the evidence, the Court finds that Plaintiff Burtner cannot satisfy either the actual notice or deliberate indifference standards which the Supreme Court now holds must be established to make an educational institution receiving federal funds under Title IX liable for sexual harassment of students. In granting the defendant's motion, the Court also declines to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the plaintiff's remaining state claims. 
I
Plaintiff Burtner filed this action against Defendants Hiram College and Professor Michael Emerson two years after graduating from the defendant school. In her amended complaint, the plaintiff alleges she had to endure quid pro quo sexual harassment in violation of Title IX (Count I); that she had to endure a sexually hostile educational environment in violation of Title IX (Count II); intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count III); tortious sexual harassment (Count IV); negligent hiring/retention (Count V); and breach of contract (Count VI).
Defendant Emerson was dismissed as a party in this suit when the Judge David Dowd granted him summary judgment on Count I and Count II, and dismissed without *854 prejudice the remaining state law counts against him. Plaintiff Burtner since filed suit in district court against Emerson.[1] 
II
Hiram is a small liberal arts college with about 850 full-time students. The school receives federal funding. Plaintiff Burtner was a student at Hiram from the fall of 1990 through June 1994. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor of arts degree in philosophy and English.
The parties dispute whether Hiram College ever had sufficient notice of Professor Emerson's alleged sexual harassment of the plaintiff. The parties also dispute whether Hiram College acted on whatever notice it received about the professor's alleged sexual harassment of students.
The record discloses the following facts and events which are relevant to whether the plaintiff can satisfy the actual notice and deliberate indifference standards of Gebser:
During the spring quarter of her sophomore year, Burtner enrolled in a required philosophy course Professor Michael Emerson taught. In May 1992, Emerson persuaded Burtner and her friend, ""B,"" to attend a seminar at the Northwoods Field Station in the upper peninsula of Michigan.
Northwoods, located in the Hiawatha National Forest, is rustic and isolated with rudimentary plumbing, no electricity and outside latrines. During the course of this seminar, Emerson provided students with alcohol. Burtner alleges that during this summer program, Emerson began to sexually harass her. This harassment consisted of comments, innuendos, the singing of sexually suggestive songs, and some touching.
From the summer of 1992 until the summer of 1993, the relationship between Emerson and Burtner did not involve sex. During the fall of 1992, Emerson wrote Burtner four or five times while she was in Cambridge, England, and encouraged her to write back to him. Emerson spent time with Burtner and ""B"" on a trip to Paris in December 1992, allegedly providing alcohol and making sexual advances toward the plaintiff.
In the summer of 1993, Burtner again attended Emerson's Northwood's program. During this program, the relationship became sexual. The relationship remained sexual until the winter quarter of 1994.
In Emerson's capacity as Burtner's faculty advisor, he insisted that she enroll in his courses, and was angry and upset with her when she considered courses others taught. Plaintiff says Emerson insisted on Burtner's presence in his office on a daily basis, and he would sometimes demand sex from Burtner in his Hiram office.
Throughout Burtner's time at Hiram, the defendant college had a sexual harassment policy contained in both the student and faculty handbooks. Pursuant to the sexual harassment policy, a student who believes he or she is being or has been harassed should report the matter to the college grievance officer (Kathryn Craig). Although Burtner knew Craig and once worked for her, Burtner never filed any grievance nor reported any sexual harassment to Hiram until she was leaving school.
In May or June of 1993, ""M"" (one of the three female students enrolled during the summer 1992 camp) approached Hiram's grievance officer with a written complaint about Professor Emerson's conduct during the 1992 summer camp. When that officer, Kathryn Craig, informed ""M"" that Hiram could not keep her complaint absolutely confidential, ""M"" chose not to file her written complaint until the following year. [see Doc. 120, exh. 7 at 376]
In that complaint M relates Emerson's attempts to talk M and her roommate into signing up for the camp, her estrangement from Emerson and the other students while at the camp, heavy alcohol consumption, and a series of events including public urination. She said that Professor Emerson tickled her on her thighs and on her chest ""very near my breasts."" She also accused Emerson of making suggestive comments.
*855 She said Emerson witnessed, but did not intervene to stop, a naked male student jump on ""M"" while she was sitting on a couch. She said the boy ""jump[ed] on top of me naked for approximately two minutes while I proceeded to hide my face in my book and everyone else in the room laughed hysterically. I asked, no begged, Professor Emerson to please make [ name deleted] put his clothes on. Professor Emerson was sitting in the balcony of the main cabin and responded with smug laughter and then said, if you don't like it, tell him yourself, or else you can come up here with me. It was pitch dark up where he was sitting and the tone of his voice truly frightened me. I couldn't ask [name deleted] to put on his clothes because I knew he wouldn't and I was afraid to antagonize anyone any further.""
Attached to this written complaint is an addendum dated June 26, 1994, in which M relates that she decided ""after thoughtful consideration, to come forward with my complaints against Michael Emerson."" She said she had discussed her grievances against Emerson with Craig in the summer of 1993 ""but fearing both a scandal and academic repercussions chose to wait until graduation to deal with the situation."" [see Doc. 120, exh. 6]
Craig testified that she recalled ""M""'s complaint against Emerson during the summer of 1993 as one involving grades or grading, though she admitted M ""may have had a written grievance with her"" during a meeting in the spring of 1993. Craig said in that deposition that she realized ""M""'s complaint may have involved more than just grades after speaking with the Plaintiff Burtner and her friend a year later. [see Doc. 120, exh. 7, at pp. 376, 380]
In a sworn affidavit, Craig also testified that ""[p]rior to June 1994, I had never received any complaints of any type regarding Professor Michael Emerson."" [see Doc. 107, exh. A, at ¶ 7]
On June 8, 1994, after discussions with another professor regarding their situation, Burtner and ""B"" went to Hiram's grievance officer. On graduation day, June 10, 1994, Burtner and ""B"" filed a written grievance against Emerson. After several conversations with Craig, Burtner says she felt that the grievance officer was not supportive and not taking her grievance seriously.
Craig contacted ""M"" in June 1994 to ask whether she wished to file her grievance against Emerson since two other women had come forward. This grievance also was forwarded to Emerson for a response.
Hiram's policy permitted tenured faculty to be dismissed for sexual harassment. The result of the allegations of sexual harassment against Emerson was a letter in Emerson's personnel file which reflected that his conduct constituted sexual harassment in violation of school policy. Emerson also failed to receive a raise the next year.
On August 1, 1994, Craig presented Burtner with her findings and gave Burtner the option of accepting an informal resolution of the grievance (a settlement) or rejecting it and proceeding with a full hearing. Burtner chose to sign the letter which found that Emerson sexually harassed her. The letter warned Emerson that any further infractions would jeopardize his employment with the college. This concluded the matter as opposed to proceeding with a more formal hearing.
Plaintiff says Emerson remained unsupervised and uncounseled after ""M""'s aborted complaint in May 1993, and for two academic years after Hiram reviewed Burtner's grievance. Dean Makosky suggested that Emerson seek other employment, which he did after the 1995-96 school year.
Since February 1996, Burtner has sought counseling on a weekly basis for treatment of her depression and anger. 
III
Both parties seek summary judgment. Pursuant to Rule 56, summary judgment shall be rendered if the evidence presented in the record shows that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. In assessing the merits of the motion, this court shall draw all justifiable inferences from the evidence presented in *856 the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Woythal v. Tex-Tenn Corp., 112 F.3d 243, 245 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 118 S. Ct. 414, 139 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1997).
However, an opponent to a motion for summary judgment may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings, but must set forth through competent and material evidence specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986); Miller v. Lorain County Bd. of Elections, 141 F.3d 252, 258-59 (6th Cir. 1998). 
IV
The first two counts in Plaintiff Burtner's amended complaint charge the college with separate violations of Title IX. Count I makes out a quid pro quo sexual harassment claim and Count II makes out a sexually hostile educational environment claim.
Title IX provides in pertinent part that, ""[n]o person ... shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" 20 U.S.C. § 1681(a). Hiram College receives federal financial assistance.
The Supreme Court of the United States held in Cannon v. University of Chicago, 441 U.S. 677, 99 S. Ct. 1946, 60 L. Ed. 2d 560 (1979), that Title IX also is enforceable by means of an implied private right of action. A school district can be held liable in damages under Title IX in cases involving a teacher's sexual harassment of a student. Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1992). Plaintiff's federal claims are grounded on this judicially-implied private right of action.
Between the time the parties filed their motions for summary judgment and this Court's ruling, the Supreme Court decided that theories of respondeat superior liability and constructive notice are not enough to hold schools liable for sexual discrimination under Title IX.
In Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, ___ U.S. ___, 118 S. Ct. 1989, 141 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1998), the Court held that an educational institution's liability will depend on a showing of actual notice and deliberate indifference. A damages remedy is not applicable under Title IX ""unless an official who at a minimum has authority to address the alleged discrimination and to institute corrective measures on the recipient's behalf has actual knowledge of discrimination in the recipient's programs and fails adequately to respond."" That response ""must amount to deliberate indifference to discrimination."" Gebser v. Lago Vista Independent School District, ___ U.S. ___, ___, 118 S. Ct. 1989, 1999 (emphasis added).
The majority opinion was explicit that Gebser did not ""affect any right of recovery that an individual may have against a school district as a matter of state law or against the teacher in his individual capacity under state law or under 42 U.S.C. § 1983."" Id. at 2000. The Court notes that the plaintiff has another suit pending against Professor Emerson in federal court.
As the facts above make clear, Plaintiff Burtner did not file her sexual harassment complaint against Professor Emerson until two days before her graduation from the Defendant Hiram College. Gebser said a damage recovery under Title IX was stopped ""unless an official of the school district [has] at a minimum ... authority to institute corrective measures on the district's behalf."" Id. at 1992. The Court finds that Kathryn Craig, the director of career services and the grievance officer for the defendant during the 1993-94 school year, does meet the Gebser threshold.
Burtner has presented evidence that a female student identified only as ""M"" sought to file a grievance against Professor Emerson a year earlier in June 1993. The record evidence is not clear on whether Craig was told in specific detail which female students had been at Emerson's philosophy camp in Michigan. Plaintiff Burtner was one of five invited students during the summer of 1993. The two-week for-credit course was held at a rustic lodge called Northwoods. Professor *857 Emerson was the only faculty member present. Certainly the events related in ""M""'s confidential report to Craig, whenever it was filed, would have put this official on notice of a serious sexual harassment situation.
However, Craig's affidavit says she first became aware of a sexual harassment complaint against Professor Emerson during June 1994 when the plaintiff and another female student first filed their complaint against Emerson. There is another reference in the record that ""M""'s complaint chiefly concerned grades or grading. It is not clear whether Craig read ""M""'s written complaint against Emerson in May or June 1993, or read those details tending to support sexual harassment sometime after receiving the plaintiff's grievance in the summer of 1994.
If notice to Craig can be considered actual notice for purposes of Title IX liability, the Court finds that Hiram College did not receive actual notice of Professor Emerson's sexual harassment until the plaintiff was graduating from Hiram College.
While the Gebser Court did not explain the actual notice standard, it is clear that the notice in that case was not enough to attach Title IX liability to the Texas school district. In that case, the high school student victim never reported the relationship to a school official. Several months before a police officer discovered the girl and her teacher in a sexual activity, the parents of two other students complained about the teacher's inappropriate comments in class. The principal met with the teacher, advised the teacher, spoke with the school guidance counselor, but never reported the parents' complaint to the school district superintendent. In Gebser, the school district lacked a formal anti-harassment policy and had not drafted an official grievance procedure for lodging complaints about sexual harassment. The teacher also lost his job and teaching license. However, the Supreme Court still held that the school district could not be held liable under Title IX because notice to officials at one school was insufficient to hold the district liable. Id. at 1992.
The filing-upon-graduation notice here gave the defendant school little or no time to correct the problem. It tends to demonstrate that the plaintiff cannot show that the defendant school also was deliberately indifferent to her situation. The evidence adduced by the parties shows, however, that the plaintiff's complaint was processed that summer. On August 1, 1994, before the plaintiff left for graduate school in New York, she and the other female student signed off on an informal grievance procedure. Emerson also signed off on the procedure which found that he had violated the school's sexual harassment policy.
Even if Plaintiff Burtner could establish actual notice in this case, she cannot show that Defendant Hiram College was deliberately indifferent to her situation after it received her complaint. The Court also notes that the defendant school district in the Gebser case was not found liable under Title IX even though it lacked a grievance policy. That case also involved a teacher's sexual activity with a young female, who was an eighth grader, a freshman and a sophomore during the relevant time period. In this suit, the complainant is a more mature college student and the defendant school did have a sexual harassment policy and grievance procedure.
The Court is convinced after a review of the record that Hiram College is entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's two Title IX claims. 
V
Plaintiff's amended complaint also includes claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count III), tortious sexual harassment (Count IV), negligent hiring and retention (Count V), and breach of contract (Count VI). Since the Court disposes of all the federal claims alleged in the plaintiff's amended complaint, only state claims remain to be litigated.
The doctrine of pendent jurisdiction permits federal courts to entertain state claims which would otherwise lack subject matter jurisdiction so long as the state claim is ""joined"" with a related federal claim, the two claims arising out of the same event or connected series of events. See United Mine *858 Workers of America v. Gibbs, 383 U.S. 715, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966). Because pendent jurisdiction is associated principally with federal question jurisdiction, where the existence of a federal claim supports jurisdiction of a pendent state claim, disposition of the federal claim allows the district court to exercise its discretion to allow any unresolved state claims to be heard in the state courts. 28 U.S.C. § 1367.
The Court declines to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state claims (Counts III, IV, V, and VI) and dismisses those claims without prejudice. 
VI
Therefore, the Court grants the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the Title IX claims on Counts I and II. The remaining state law claims (Counts III, IV, V, and VI) are dismissed without prejudice as the Court declines to exercise pendent jurisdiction when the federal questions no longer remain in the case.
The Court denies the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.
The Court also denies as moot the defendant's first motion for summary judgment [Doc. 45]; denies as moot the plaintiff's motion for an extension of time within which to respond to the defendant's second motion for summary judgment [Doc. 115]; grants the plaintiff's motion for leave to file instanter memo in opposition to the defendant's second summary judgment motion [Doc. 120]; denies as moot the defendant's motion to extend time to serve a rebuttal expert report [Doc. 126]; denies the defendant's motion to strike the plaintiff's summary judgment motion and impose sanctions [Doc. 127]; denies as moot the defendant's motion to compel the plaintiff to submit to a psychological exam [Doc. 138]; denies the defendant's motion to continue the trial [Docs. 139]; and denies the defendant's motion for leave to file a supplemental memorandum [Docs. 140].
IT IS SO ORDERED.

This included unwanted touching, flirting, fondling and degrading propositions of a sexual nature,” according to the statement.The victims worked at a university library and were supervised by Bright-Abu.“Everybody said this was typical of him,” said Mercedes Woodson, one of two women who say they were assaulted by the man.The lawsuit charges that the victims reported Bright-Abu's sexually abusive and offensive comments to university officials, but the university failed to respond in a way that would protect the students and stop the behavior.“He touched my breasts,” claims Rukayat Bello.""When I saw her (upset) I said ‘it's time to do something,’"" Woodson said.The women say their complaints to supervisors were ignored. They eventually filed a police report.""Howard University created a hostile and abusive working environment for all plaintiffs by continuing to employ Bright-Abu after being made aware of his ongoing physical and verbal sexual assault,"" said Christal Edwards, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit.""When the University administration became aware of the allegations, we reported the case to the Metropolitan Police Department. The individual was subsequently charged and terminated from the university. We take the safety of our students very seriously,"" the university said in a statement to Fox5."
https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2017/07/07/brazilian-wax-question-lands-professor-hot-water,"Howard University has found a professor of law guilty of sexual harassment in relation to a 2015 test question involving Brazilian waxing. At first blush, it’s the kind of case that might anger even modest professors concerned about the rising tide of what’s been called campus illiberalism, or student calls for censorship of emotionally discomfiting speech.
But Reginald Robinson’s full question about a client who fell asleep during a wax and later alleged improper touching is rather graphic, with references to a “landing strip,” hairlessness from “belly button to buttocks"" and more. Still, some free speech and academic freedom advocates are calling Howard’s response excessive: mandatory sensitivity training for Robinson, prior administrative review of his future test questions, classroom observation and a warning that any further violations of the university’s sexual harassment policies may result in termination.
The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education -- which asked Howard to revoke Robinson’s sanctions, but reportedly did not hear back by a June 30 deadline -- said this week that the university’s “overreaction to a simple hypothetical question is a threat to academic freedom and a professor’s ability to effectively teach students.” The question ""clearly does not constitute sexual harassment,” added Susan Kruth, FIRE’s senior program officer for legal and public advocacy. 
Robinson’s attorney, Gaillard T. Hunt, said via email Thursday that it’s “silly but relatively harmless” if Howard’s law school “wants to treat its students as delicate snowflakes who must be protected from unpleasant hypothetical cases.” But when it makes a “formal finding that a professor is guilty of ‘sexual harassment’ because of a discussion in class, that’s libelous of him as an individual and debases the whole concept.” Howard did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Two students complained about Robinson's question, triggering the university's investigation, according to FIRE.

                                UPPER EAST SIDE — Hunter College was slow to address sexual harassment complaints and failed to protect victims from retaliation in the aftermath, according to an investigation by the U.S. Department of Education.

In May 2014, the department's Office for Civil Rights included Hunter College in a list of 55 schools to be investigated for violating Title IX laws, which prohibits discrimination based on sex in any education program receiving federal funding and requires schools to have a protocol in place on how to handle complaints.

The probe was triggered after a student made sexual harassment complaints against a professor in 2011 and 2012, but the investigation revealed that the school had failed to properly address a slew of other complaints.

        
                                            

The student filed two complaints against the professor a year apart, and it wasn't until the second complaint that Hunter College finally launched an investigation into the matter, according to the education department.

In Hunter College's own report, it found that the professor had ""preyed upon the [student's] immaturity and family circumstances, including her mother’s illness, and used interactions with [her] sister in order to further his relationship with [her].""

The school's report also states that the two had a consensual relationship until April 2012, and after that, the professor’s conduct became “non-consensual, uninvited, and unwelcomed … [i]t offended, annoyed and harassed [the complainant],"" according to OCR's findings.

In addition to waiting a year of the first complaint to finally take action, the school took another four months to complete an investigation, and didn't report its outcome to the student until months after that, while discussing the results with the professor during that period, according to the education department.

Following its investigation, the school determined there wasn't enough evidence that the professor had retaliated against her. The professor was fired in the summer of 2013 after the school found that his ""conduct became inappropriate.""

The probe also found that Hunter College had not adopted or published information on how to report and handle harassment complaints, and had no measures established to prevent a hostile environment after a complaint is made, OCR's report states.

""The college’s determination that the professor engaged in repeated, unwelcome and graphic communications after April 2012 should have caused the college to assess whether a sexually hostile environment existed for the complainant,"" the report reads.

The Office for Civil Rights also reviewed other case files during the same period and found other instances where the school didn't do timely and fair investigations, and didn't provide sufficient solutions to address the impact of harassment and possible hostile environments.

The other instances involved a doctor affiliated with the school's nursing internship program, who admitted to a student that he was sexually attracted to black women, hugged her and rubbed his genitals against her leg; a student who allegedly raped another student; a doctoral student who threatened to remove a female student from a lab after she rejected his sexual advances — none of which were handled in a sufficient manner, according to the Office for Civil Rights.

        
                                            

The U.S. Department of Education would not say whether the outcome of the investigation involved any penalties or return of federal funding.

But in a written statement the agency said that CUNY and Hunter College had agreed to remedy its violations by taking a number of actions, including revising its reporting procedures, provide training to staff and college students about sexual misconduct and the school's policies, addressing any remaining effects the student may have suffered, and reexamining and handling all complaints of sexual harassment, assault and violence filed in recent years.

Hunter College released a statement saying that it ""has agreed to a settlement without any admission of liability.""

""OCR found that Hunter 'did take some important and appropriate steps to investigate and address the allegations. Hunter College and CUNY have always been committed to maintaining a campus environment free from discrimination, intimidation, or violence of any sort. It is a core value of the College and a goal we vigorously pursue by broadly disseminating our policies and rigorously enforcing them. Hunter College and CUNY will continue to work diligently to comply with Title IX rules.""

http://www.tampabay.com/news/education/college/usf-scientist-resigns-ending-a-short-tenure-filled-with-turmoil/2335142,"TAMPA — A prominent University of South Florida scientist has voluntarily resigned in an agreement with USF, ending a short tenure riddled with grievances about his behavior. The agreement follows months of discord between Herb Maschner, 58, and colleagues. His resignation date is Oct. 31.In a March email, the College of Arts and Sciences dean excoriated Maschner for ""insulting and unprofessional"" treatment of his colleagues. Dean Eric Eisenberg also decried Maschner's ""poor judgment,"" including assigning his teenage sons to operate expensive university equipment on upcoming trips, potentially taking the place of USF students.PREVIOUS COVERAGE: USF faculty complained of a hostile, sexist, boorish bossOther issues led the dean to ""doubt (Maschner's) ability to manage complex projects smoothly and without blaming others when things do not go as planned."" Maschner had already been stripped of a leadership title after he failed to disclose a sexual harassment finding from his previous job at another university. He'd already been told to improve his behavior. And an internal review of faculty concerns was underway. The reprimand was to be ""a serious wake-up call."" Maschner contested it. But complaints kept coming. In the resignation paperwork, USF says it has no reason to terminate Maschner for misconduct. Both parties agree there was no wrongdoing.Maschner will receive six weeks' pay of his $195,000 salary. He also will take a multimillion-dollar grant with him.He did not respond to a request for comment. USF does not comment on personnel matters.USF began recruiting Maschner in 2014, while he was at Idaho State University. Prominent in the field of digital heritage, Maschner came to USF to lead a center that digitally documents historical sites. He would prove key in securing a $4.6 million grant from the Hitz Foundation. However, he quickly sparred with colleagues. This summer, an exhaustive legal review revealed Maschner to be an insensitive, hostile boss, but fell short of faulting him for discrimination. Maschner vehemently denied those claims. The lawyer who compiled it acknowledged having a hard time finding facts amid the conflict. What emerged, she wrote, was a picture of Maschner's aggression and attempts to undermine coworkers. USF responded with a memo further curtailing Maschner's role in the center he once led, called CVAST, or the Center for Virtualization and Applied Spatial Technologies. For instance, he would need his boss to sign off on proposals for using the Hitz grant money. At least one complaint about Maschner is still ongoing. The 11-page resignation agreement outlines the specifics of Maschner's last months at USF and beyond. Much of it focuses on the Hitz grant. For instance, USF will have to return $138,000 in equipment to the foundation.

Now it will be held only as long as public records law requires, marked as having ""no administrative significance and superseded by voluntary resignation.""Maschner contested that reprimand, asserting his academic freedom. He also defended placing his sons on research teams, saying that decision was within his discretion. The agreement also allows Maschner to pursue 501(c)3 status for a company he created earlier this year with a mission mirroring that of CVAST. Before, proceeding with company activities would have violated USF policy. Now Maschner may go ahead. Until he leaves, he will work off campus, helping transition USF away from the Hitz grant.USF has instituted mandatory reference checks since the Idaho State revelation. The university didn't know that Maschner had violated Idaho State policy for sexually harassing a graduate student until Maschner approached USF three years later, as an Idaho newspaper readied to publish a story.Contact Claire McNeill at (727) 893-8321 or cmcneill@tampabay.com."

                                                            A former Indiana State University professor and researcher at the Kinsey Institute may have his psychologist license revoked for allegedly sexually harassing his research subjects.\nThis summer, four ISU students filed a complaint with the Indiana attorney general's office, alleging professor Jerome A. Cerny, 59, inappropriately touched their genitalia and made sexual comments during research. The complaints contain four counts of inappropriate conduct between September 1994 and June 2002.  \nCerny will defend his license in front of the Indiana State Psychology Board at a hearing Nov. 21. \nThe Board suspended his license in an emergency session May 16. \nISU closed Cerny's lab in 1996 following two similar student accusations. From September 1998 to August 1999, Cerny went on sabbatical where he did research on psychophysiological processes of sexual behavior at the Kinsey Institute.\nJennifer Bass, spokesperson for Kinsey, said no one was aware of any past complaints against  Cerny when he was accepted to the Institute. She said there were no complaints made during his time at the Kinsey Institute.\nMichael Morse, an ISU student from 1992 to 1997, discussed his contact with Cerny in 1996.\nMorse, a psychology major, said he was eager to be a research subject to add to his resume. He showed up at Cerny's lab, but was turned down because he didn't meet the criteria.\nIn 1997, Cerny allegedly approached Morse, then a senior, and asked if he was still interested in being a subject. Morse said it was typical of his style of recruitment. \nMost of the subjects were enrolled in his courses and were not paid. Instead, they received ""massive amounts"" of extra credit -- a half-hour in the laboratory in exchange for almost a grade higher in some cases, Morse said.\nMorse said he was told by Cerny, both verbally and in a written consent form, that his genitals would only be viewed once during the ejaculatory latency research. Morse said Cerny asked him to masturbate to a pornographic movie while he talked to him over an intercom. For almost three hours, Morse unsuccessfully tried to ejaculate wearing the plethysmograph. Cerny then told him to use his hand and then Morse ejaculated. Cerny then allegedly grabbed Morse's penis.\nDuring the procedure, Morse said Cerny touched his penis at least eight times during a two-day period, for ""vague and ambiguous reasons.""\nMorse said he felt uncomfortable, but didn't say anything at that moment.\n""I didn't even realize that anything was wrong until he tickled my sides at the water fountain outside of class,"" he said. ""Then, I realized something terribly wrong went on.""\nCerny did not wish to comment when called at his home Monday night.\nIn the complaints, the counts detail Cerny's relationship with ISU students, including accusations Cerny massaging, pinching and tickling. The complaints also claim Cerny suggested that he stay in the room with the subjects and watch them masturbate. In his lab, students also claim Cerny asked them to help him design a more ergonomic chair. One student agreed and took his pants off so Cerny could trace his legs, buttocks and testicles on paper.\nShelly Mazo, director of the Indiana State Psychology Board, said a board of seven members will vote on whether or not to revoke Cerny's license.\nBass said regardless of the outcome of Cerny's hearing, situations like these are always detrimental to the sexual research field.\n""Doing sex research is a very, very sensitive topic,"" she said. ""We need to provide more protections for people involved, both researchers and subjects.""\nBass said researchers should never touch a subject or be in the room when they are performing personal sexual acts. Most of all, she said subjects need to know what will actually occur in the study and their rights to privacy.\n""Most subjects don't know they can back out at any time,"" she said\nMorse said he felt the same way.\n""I was just in terror of him,"" he said. ""I literally felt that I could not get out of there unless I finished the project. It had nothing to do with science."" \nThe public hearing will begin at 9:15 p.m., Friday at the Indiana Government Center South, Room 1, in Indianapolis. \n-- Contact campus editor Adam Aasen at aaasen@indiana.edu.

													A former clinic director at the Indiana University School of Dentistry in Indianapolis who was fired last year after students complained he inappropriately touched them is suing to get his job back, saying he was denied a fair hearing.
Dr. Matthew C. Moeller, a faculty member at the school for 30 years, filed suit Thursday in U.S. District Court, claiming he was prohibited from learning the identity of students who complained, as well as specifics that would allow him to defend himself.
The suit alleges breach of contract, defamation, emotional distress, breach of covenant, and violations of his due-process rights under the fifth and fourteenth amendments.
In court filings, Moeller acknowledged “on occasion he would pat, rub and massage the backs of female students,” but denied the conduct was unwanted, unwelcome or “presented in the context of sexual harassment.”
In one incident, he acknowledged touching a female student’s left thigh while sitting next to her at a seminar. But he said in court documents the touch was innocent greeting “something to the effect of ‘how are you doing, OK?’” and when he realized the touching was inappropriate, he apologized to her within 24 hours.
In October 2014, Moeller was notified by the university’s Office of Equal Opportunity that students had complained of sexual harassment.
“Upon having been officially corrected, I do not believe I have made the same mistake twice,” Moeller wrote last year to his dean, Dr. John N. Williams. “Hence no pattern. …There is nothing sexual or harassing about what I have done.”
Two months later, after the investigation was complete, Moeller was temporarily relieved of his duties as clinic director. He was fired on March 26, 2015, as a result of “serious personal and professional misconduct.”
Moeller protested, saying he never got a chance to read the investigation report and didn’t have a chance to defend himself by learning the specifics of the complaints or the identity of the accusers.
In November, a university board of review found procedural deficiencies in the termination, including a lack of documentation and any opportunity for behavior remediation.
The board’s report specifically said the process to terminate Moeller violated his “right to adequate due process” and that the “decision-making process did not meet the requirements of essential fairness.”
The review board also said Moeller’s personnel file did not contain any prior documentation of behavior incidents, warnings or admonitions.
“While the board agrees in principle that the university must not tolerate sexual harassment, it also recognizes employees have the right to feedback and where appropriate, the opportunity to remediate their behavior with a behavioral plan,” the board of review wrote in its report.
Moeller, who had been working for the School of Dentistry since 1984, said in court filing he regularly received grades of “excellent” on his annual reviews, and always got a “favorable” review for potential for promotion. Just a few months before learning of the OEO investigation, his appointment as clinical assistant professor had been extended for seven years.
In December, IU Chancellor Nasser Paydar sent a memorandum to Moeller, indicating a willingness to accept some of the recommendations for a limited review, provided Moeller “waive any appeal rights, including claims of due process or otherwise, internally or externally.”
Not liking those terms, Moeller appealed to IU President Michael McRobbie, but earlier this month, McRobbie upheld the firing “and acknowledged that the administrative remedies were exhausted.”
University officials declined to comment on the lawsuit.
Moeller is asking the court to rule that the university violated his due process rights, and that he be restored to his positions with full back pay, along with unspecified damages.
“Dr. Moeller appears to be the latest victim of a concerning trend by universities to throw out fairness and due process in a flawed effort to appease the Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights,” said his attorney, Jay Mercer of Indianapolis-based Mercer Belanger, in a written statement. “Dr. Moeller now has a full understanding of the devastating, deep and long-lasting impacts on those wrongly accused of sexual misconduct who are denied fair and equitable treatment by their colleges in investigating and adjudicating alleged incidents.”

								A district court judge has granted a legal victory to Indiana University’s School of Dentistry and high-ranking members of its faculty after finding the school did not violate a former clinic director’s rights by firing him for alleged sexual harassment of students.
Southern District Chief Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson’s handed down the summary judgement on Wednesday.
Dr. Matthew C. Moeller, a 30-year faculty member of the school, sued his former employer and supervisors in 2016, alleging federal and state law claims related to due process and breach-of-contract violations. Moeller’s trouble began two years earlier, when he was investigated by the university for alleged sexual harassment of female students.
In court filings, Moeller acknowledged “on occasion he would pat, rub and massage the backs of female students,” but denied the conduct was unwanted, unwelcome or “presented in the context of sexual harassment.”
In one incident, he acknowledged touching a female student’s left thigh while sitting next to her at a seminar. But he said in court documents the touch was innocent greeting “something to the effect of ‘how are you doing, OK?’” and when he realized the touching was inappropriate, he apologized to her within 24 hours.
Moeller was sent a notice of the complaint against him, which included the allegations from the female student, as well as allegations that both male and female students were “creeped out” by his actions, yet chose not to broach the issue for fear of academic retribution.
In a subsequent written response and interview, Moeller claimed the allegations were true, but not in the context in which they were presented. He asserted his practice of touching students was meant to encourage them and was not intended to be sexual in nature. He also claimed he was a touchy person by nature who responded best to physical encouragement.
Moeller went on to write he had implemented a zero-tolerance policy to break himself of his habit of touching students, and offered to be placed on probation under similar conditions. The university eventually removed him from his position as a clinic director, then terminated him after a series of meetings between the school’s high-ranking faculty members determined he had violated university policy.
Though his initial appeals and requests for rehearing were denied, Moeller found a minor victory with the Faculty Board of Review, which determined there were procedural deficiencies in the investigation into his actions. The board recommended the university provide Moeller with a copy of its investigatory report, interview him a second time and provide a full explanation of the factors that led to his dismissal.
IU Chancellor Nasser Paydar made those options available to Moeller, but only on the condition that he waive his right to appeal. Moeller refused and instead filed the suit against the university, Paydar, IU President Michael McRobbie and other university faculty members involved in the investigation.
The defendants moved for summary judgment, prompting Moeller to move for dismissal without prejudice of two of his claims—breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.
As an initial matter, Magnus-Stinson denied Moeller’s motion to dismiss the two breach claims, finding that if she did not do so, he would presumably litigate the same claims in state court, a course of action that would be unfair to the defendants.

Magnus-Stinson went on to write that the university and individual faculty members being sued in their official capacities each had 11th Amendment immunity, so Moeller’s claims against them could not continue. While the faculty members did not have immunity for the claims against them in their individual capacities, the chief judge determined each of those claims failed as a matter of law.
Magnus-Stinson granted summary judgment to the faculty members on Moeller’s due-process claim, determining no reasonable jury could conclude he was not afforded notice of the claims against him or an opportunity to respond.
Rather, the notice Moeller received outlined the six allegations against him that were the subject of the investigation. He then had the opportunity to respond both in writing and in an interview, as well as in other meetings with the school’s faculty and through his various appeals and requests for reconsideration.
“The University’s decisions to ensure an environment where students are free from uninvited back rubs, thigh touches and other physical contact by a clinical instructor who holds the power to negatively impact their clinical successes is a lawful one within its prerogative,” Magnus-Stinson wrote. “A procedural due process claim is not an invitation for the Court to consider whether it agrees with the University’s judgment, or whether it endorses the University’s policies and procedures.”
She also granted summary judgment to the defendants on the state law breach claims, determining neither of those claims was based on any actual contract between Moeller and the school. Further, Moeller failed to respond to the university’s substantive arguments regarding those claims, thus waiving any argument in opposition.
Finally, in a footnote to the 48-page opinion, Magnus-Stinson addressed Moeller’s claims that his conduct, though inappropriate, did not rise to the level of sexual harassment.
“The Court rejects the overall theme of his argument—that the Defendants were somehow required to conclude that although he engaged in the conduct for which he was terminated, he should be excused either because he did not intend the consequences or because the recipients of his behavior should not have been offended,” she wrote.

https://www.idsnews.com/article/2017/10/when-sentenced-on-a-count-of-confinement-guoping-wang-was-described-as-more-than-his-worst-act,"
                                                            To colleagues, family and friends, Guoping Wang is a dedicated family man, hard worker and accomplished ballet dancer and instructor.
He is helpful, humble and soft spoken, the type of father who cooked breakfast for his family every morning and would run to and from his work duties to ensure his kids got to piano lessons or math club on time.

                                

                                This is how he is described in seven character letters submitted to the court last week. The former Jacobs School of Music lecturer, who, through his lawyer, declined to be interviewed for this article, was sentenced to two years of probation Wednesday after a student reported in spring 2016 that he had sexually assaulted her.
As the Indiana Daily Student previously reported, this allegation was one of multiple against Wang that the University found while investigating. The details of these allegations are contained in a 13-page memorandum which has not been made available to the public. The complainant in this particular case requested police involvement, according to court documents.
Those who have worked with Wang said they never thought he was capable of such a thing. When he was arrested last spring, he was charged with criminal confinement and sexual battery. At the Wednesday hearing, he pleaded guilty to the criminal confinement charge with the battery charge being dropped.
“These charges are so far out of character I simply cannot believe it to be true,” wrote Sara Knight, a character witness who met Wang at a ballet camp in Cincinnati. “I have never witnessed him to be inappropriate. Ever.”
Wang grew up in China and had a poor upbringing. In court documents, his wife said they met as students at the Shanghai Dance Academy before marrying and moving to America.
The brochure for the 2016 Spring Ballet says he worked with the Shanghai Ballet Company for 11 years before coming to IU, where he attended the Jacobs School of Music for graduate studies. After graduation, he worked with multiple prestigious ballet companies, including the Ballet Chicago Company, Colorado Ballet, Joffrey Ballet of Chicago and Lyric Opera of Chicago.

                                
                                                                    
                                    According to several of the character letters, he chose to teach dance at IU and in several other programs after retiring from professional performance.
At one point, Wang’s family lived outside Chicago while he worked in Bloomington and drove back and forth between the two cities every weekend. Three people who knew him during his time in Chicago mentioned this in their letters, saying it was both a testament to his passion for ballet and his devotion to his family.
Ballet instructors in New York, Ohio and Maine said they had observed him teach students without incident, and some said they invited him to teach their own. They added that he was a soft spoken person who may have had trouble sometimes communicating in English but got his point across nonetheless. When Judge Marc Kellams asked Wang about his English skills Wednesday, he described them as ""not so good.""
“Most ballets use French,” Wang said.

                                    All of Wang's former colleagues said he got stellar reviews from students. Jacques Cesbron, who has been a ballet instructor at IU, said he was impressed by Wang’s teaching style and his ability to combine his American and Chinese training.
Other colleagues say he offered to substitute other instructors’ classes. He took on side jobs at other ballet schools to share his expertise and help support his family.
He taught ballet at IU for over a decade before the University fired him after investigating multiple reports of unwanted advances toward students and staff, according to court documents.
Wang, who has worked with ballet companies on at least four continents, testified under oath Wednesday that he had taken a job working at Menards. His wife, who said she had been a homemaker for 20 years, has also taken a job to support the family.
The testaments to Wang’s character became a key part of Wednesday’s hearing. Kellams said he read the letters, which spoke of a loving father and accomplished ballet master.
“Mr. Wang is more than this bad act,” Wang’s lawyer Katherine Liell said.

http://www.pressherald.com/2011/07/16/standish-nursing-student-awarded-_300000-in-suit_2011-07-16/,"
						A nursing student from Standish has won a $300,000 award from a jury in a lawsuit she filed against a nursing school that expelled her from its program in 2008 — after she complained repeatedly of sexual harassment by one of its male instructors.
The InterCoast Career Institute, a California-based school that operated a nursing program in South Portland, dismissed Aimee Helwig in October 2008, after about nine months of study, for violating the “InterCoast Practical Nursing Code of Conduct.”
In a complaint filed in Cumberland County Superior Court, Helwig contended that she had not violated the code and that the school expelled and discriminated against her because she had accused her instructor, David Martin, of sexual harassment.
The school expelled Helwig about a week after it was notified that she had filed a complaint about Martin and the school with the Maine Human Rights Commission.
Helwig sued the school for maintaining a hostile work environment, thereby breaching the tuition contract, and for retaliating against her with libelous statements and unwarranted expulsion after she filed the human rights complaint.
The civil court jury last week awarded her $100,000 on the claim for retaliation, $150,000 for the inconvenience and emotional distress caused, $30,000 for punitive damages and $20,000 in tuition reimbursement for the breach of contract.
Helwig could not be reached for comment Friday.
According to court documents, Martin continually asked Helwig invasive questions, touched her inappropriately and made suggestive remarks. When she rebuked him, he began giving her low grades and unflattering write-ups.
The school did not remove the poor marks and evaluations from Helwig’s record despite Helwig’s reports to the school about Martin’s behavior, the lawsuit contends.
Other students in Helwig’s class reported harassment. Lisa Green wrote on a teacher evaluation that Martin had made comments about her and another student, saying “Why don’t you sit on her lap?” and “I want you two making out by the end of the day,” according to court records.
Helwig claimed that the school did not take sufficient action against Martin and that he continued to act aggressively toward her.
The school dismissed Martin in August 2008 on the grounds that it no longer had a position for him, court records show. However, Martin still worked at the same clinical facility as Helwig during the fall.
The school later transferred Helwig to a different location, after which Martin began making critical public statements about her, according to court records.
School officials declined to comment Friday on the jury’s award to Helwig.

http://www.twincities.com/2007/08/07/twin-cities-woman-sues-college-alleging-harassment/,"A St. Paul woman is suing Inver Hills Community College and a former music professor, claiming that he harassed and molested her and that the college did little to investigate her grievance.  
The lawsuit was filed last month in Dakota County but was moved to U.S. District Court last week at the college’s request. Two of the 10 counts claim the school violated Title IX, a federal statute barring sexual harassment or discrimination in educational institutions that receive federal funding.
The school’s legal counsel referred all questions to the state attorney general’s office, which represents Minnesota State Colleges and Universities in litigation. A spokeswoman for MnSCU declined to comment.
Angela M. Van Auken began working toward a paralegal degree in May 2005 by enrolling in summer classes on the Inver Grove Heights campus. She completed “The History of Rock and Roll” to fulfill a liberal arts requirement and received an A in the class.
The top grade came at a steep price, according to the lawsuit. She maintains that Herminio Diaz, a longtime music professor, locked her in a classroom and tried to kiss her while grabbing her wrists and invited her to a motel room.
The suit also alleges he invited her to his office to see a letter of reference, then groped her.				
Van Auken, 38, maintains she filed a grievance with the college July 20, 2005, but received a letter a week later from Julie Jones, the school’s human resources director and grievance investigator, indicating the investigation was closed. Diaz, then 63, had resigned July 26.
Van Auken’s attorney said the decision to drop the investigation violated the school’s grievance process.				
“You’ve got to talk to other witnesses, other students,” Christopher Walsh said. “You have to make findings. You have to determine, did sexual harassment happen? Did it not? You can’t just throw up your hands and say, well, he resigned. They cut short the process.”
The school’s marketing manager and other employees said that Jones is no longer employed at the college but that they were unaware of the circumstances surrounding her departure.
Diaz did not return calls made to his home phone.
Diaz’s attorney, Howard L. Bolter, declined to comment on the litigation. In a legal answer to the lawsuit, Diaz maintained that he had a consensual sexual relationship with Van Auken and that she never resisted his advances.
Van Auken dropped out of Inver Hills “due to false perceptions of her character” among her classmates and the perception she was “trading sex for grades.” She has been unable to find a comparable degree program with similar tuition, according to the suit.
The suit seeks undetermined damages in excess of $50,000.
The college’s 90-acre campus hosts about 5,400 students per semester, about 60 percent of them female, and half of the student population is older than the traditional college age.

State places university psychologist Cara Hale on probation over sex with graduate assistant
July 11, 2013

	On February 15, 2013, the Iowa Board of Psychology placed psychologist Cara Hale’s license on probation for up to four years. The Board’s document states that Hale, who was at that time employed as a senior staff psychologist at Iowa State University (ISU), engaged in improper sexual contact with a coworker and failed to comply with Ethical Principles of Psychologists and Code of Conduct. Specifically, the document states that Hale had a sexual relationship with a male graduate assistant while he was under her supervision. Further, the document states that Hale confided in a female graduate student who she was mentoring and supervising, information about her personal life, including information about her husband, who was one of the student’s professors at ISU. Lastly, another intern in the ISA psychology program reported to program directors that she was offended by a sexual comment Hale made about the intern’s husband. Hale, who was working at a federal facility in California when the probation order was issued, resigned from position and subsequently surrendered her Iowa license.

http://www.basementmedicine.org/campus-community/2012/09/17/wiseman-to-leave-in-december/,"
                JSC Humanities Professor Fred Wiseman will stop teaching classes at Johnson State College at the end of the fall 2012 semester, according to information released by JSC Dean of Administration Sharron Scott on Friday, Sept. 14.
Responding to a Basement Medicine request under Vermont’s Public Records Law for release of documents pertaining to any severance agreement between the college and Wiseman, who has been at the center of a controversy involving allegations of sexual harassment, the College provided a copy of an agreement signed prior to the beginning of the fall semester.
Requests for three other documents filed at the same time, including the complete Policy 311 report delivered to President Murphy’s office in May, were denied, citing permitted exemptions under the Public Records Law.
An official separation agreement between Wiseman, JSC, the VSC and the VSC Faculty Federation was dated Aug. 1 “as a resolution of the disciplinary process” related to Policy 311 complaints against Professor Wiseman.
According to the agreement, Wiseman will continue to teach full-time for the fall 2012 semester, during which he will be paid full salary, but he will no longer be the Humanities Department Chair. During this time, Wiseman “will be subject to all JSC and VSC academic standards in teaching, academic advising, scholarship, and service to College and community.”
Wiseman will then be on paid leave during the spring 2013, fall 2013 and spring 2014 semesters, per the agreement, during which time he will receive half of the base pay salary he would have received for full-time service.
The agreement states Wiseman will retire at the conclusion of the 2013-2014 academic year.
Additionally, the agreement stipulates “The college will not impose any discipline on Professor Wiseman as a result of the Policy 311 complaints filed in the Spring 2012 semester. Professor Wiseman shall not retaliate in any way against any individual who initiated, investigated, cooperated with the investigation into, or deliberated on the Policy 311 complaints against him.”
The agreement was signed by Wiseman, Murphy and VSC Vice President and General Counselor William J. Reedy.
In March 2012, then-JSC student Nicole Daigneault filed a formal complaint against Wiseman alleging a violation of the Vermont State Colleges’ Policy 311, which among other things prohibits sexual harassment.
An official summary of those findings from the Office of the (JSC) President, provided by Daigneault’s attorney, David Sleigh, noted, “While the investigators did not find that Ms. Daigneault’s overall academic environment at the college was objectively intimidating, hostile or offensive, the Investigators arrived at the conclusion that harassment based on sex as a protected category occurred. Further, they concluded that there is ample evidence of ‘Related Unprofessional Conduct.’”
In a subsequent letter from JSC President Barbara Murphy to Daigneault, also provided by Sleigh, a part-time instructor at Lyndon State College, Murphy said she “accepted” their findings, and that administrators would “initiate the next steps set forth in that Policy.” (See https://www.basementmedicine.org/top-stories/2012/09/10/questions-surround-allegations-of-sexual-harassment/)
In an email interview with Basement Medicine last week, Wiseman said, “I cannot make any comments about the student who made a complaint against me. That could be construed as retaliation under governing College policies. I may, however,disclose that all allegations against me were investigated and I was not disciplined in any way. I expect that if I had acted in violation of College expectations, there would have been discipline.”
In a letter to Basement Medicine accompanying the release of the August1 agreement, JSC Dean of Administration Sharron Scott noted that “ For reasons that President Murphy has discussed, we will not be able to speak about the details of the agreement. However, President Murphy offers the following general statement on the way we approach such matters:
“As the President of Johnson, as an educator and as a person, I want to be clear that I have always taken allegations of harassment and unprofessional conduct, very, very seriously. That includes conducting a thorough, objective and fair investigation when an issue arises. What matters to us in terms of resolving any particular dispute is the result. My chief goal as President is to provide a safe campus and a safe teaching and learning environment for all students, faculty and staff, while minimizing the risk of undue disruption and conflict for the community.”

https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/herpetologists-league-revokes-distinguished-herpetologist-award-64504,"Prominent turtle conservationist Richard Vogt of the National Institute of Amazonian Research was stripped of his Distinguished Herpetologist Award the day after he received it at the Joint Meeting of Ichthyologists and Herpetologists, recently held in New York. The Herpetologists’ League revoked the honor on Friday night (July 13) in light of the images of female students conducting field research in bathing suits that Vogt displayed while accepting his award. According to Motherboard, Jessica Ford, a graduate student at McGill University who attended Vogt’s lecture on Thursday (July 12), says, “a few people walked out, but most people either were flabbergasted or nervously laughed.”Some of the photographs of the bikini-clad students had blue boxes placed over the women’s torsos by the conference’s audiovisual team. Vogt was unaware of the changes.  The controversy garnered attention when several attendees tweeted about the unacceptable content of Vogt’s award...Henry Mushinsky, the conference committee chairman, tells the Democrat  Chronicle that parts of the images were covered up “to minimize anyone feeling uncomfortable,” as some of the photos were “too revealing.” Mushinky says it’s not uncommon for researchers in the field to wear bikinis or other swimwear, but Vogt’s images were atypical. “Why does he have these pictures and why does he think it’s okay to show these pictures?” Ford adds. The societies at the meeting are putting together a Code of Conduct that the Herpetologists’ League will be signing. Both the League and other herpetologists have claimed Vogt, who has a recently identified turtle namesake, has been known to misbehave towards young, female colleagues. Lori Neuman-Lee, who leads the League’s newly formed diversity and inclusion committee says, “This has provided an opportunity—an unfortunate opportunity—to talk about this,” according to The New York Times. Interested in reading more?Receive full access to more than 35 years of archives, as well as TS Digest, digital editions of The Scientist, feature stories, and much more!Join for free todayAlready a member?Login Here"

https://casetext.com/case/campbell-v-board-of-regents,"  THEIS, District Judge.   This matter is before the court on the motion of defendants for summary judgment. (Doc. 24). The action is brought under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of  1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e, et seq., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and state common law. Plaintiff alleges sexual harassment, retaliation, constructive discharge, as well as a due process violation.   I. Background   The material facts are undisputed unless otherwise noted. The dispute arises out of plaintiff's employment as an Administrative Assistant in the Department of Grain Science at Kansas State University. By a one-year contract, plaintiff's appointment to this position became effective on June 10, 1986. Before the expiration of this term, plaintiff signed a second contract covering the period from June 18, 1987 through June 17, 1988.   On February 18, 1988, plaintiff brought a complaint of sexual harassment to Walter Woods, Dean of the College of Agriculture. A meeting was held on this date, attended by plaintiff's attorney and Dick Seaton — the University Attorney — at which plaintiff outlined the following claims:   (1) that her supervisor — Dr. Charles Deyoe, Head of the Department of Grain Science — slapped her on the butt on December 22, 1987, and that this incident took place in Room 03K Shellenberger Hall after plaintiff had called Dr. Deyoe out of a meeting to deliver a message. Plaintiff stated that at the time she said to Dr. Deyoe: ""If you don't do that again, I won't tell your wife;""   (2) that Dr. Deyoe had told plaintiff several times prior to December 22, 1987 that he would slap her on the butt;   (3) that plaintiff told Deanna Selby, a coworker, of the incident of December 22 on the same day, stating to her: ""Dr. Deyoe has lost his mind. I'm going home; he hit me on the butt;""   (4) that plaintiff also told June Bishop, Office Supervisor in the Department of Grain Science and Industry, of the incident the day after it occurred;   (5) that in January 1988, Dr. Deyoe said that he would hit plaintiff again but obviously she does not like it;   (6) that plaintiff felt like Dr. Deyoe ""treated her like a piece of meat;""   (7) that Dr. Deyoe crowded plaintiff in her office space and made knee to knee contact in his office, and further that this made her feel uncomfortable, but that she had not observed any inappropriate actions by Dr. Deyoe with other employees;   (8) that Dr. Deyoe had used obscenities in talking to plaintiff about others; and   (9) that Dr. Deyoe had not used any other inappropriate language or made other suggestive approaches.   A dispute exists regarding whether and at what time plaintiff told other employees in the Agriculture Department about the December 22 incident. Plaintiff alleges that she told Deanna Selby of the incident on the same day and told June Bishop the following day.   To investigate plaintiff's claims, Dean Woods met with Dr. Deyoe, informed him of the charges against him, and gave him an opportunity to respond. Dean Woods also talked to Deanna Selby, June Bishop, and Dr. Keith Behnke regarding the December 22 incident. The findings and conclusions of Dean Woods were stated in a letter of administrative resolution dated March 23, 1988 and sent to both plaintiff and Dr. Deyoe. (Eht. 10 to Defendant's motion in support). Among his findings were that:   (1) Dr. Deyoe generally denied plaintiff's allegations.   (2) Ms. Bishop and Ms. Selby stated that plaintiff made no mention on or about December 22, 1987 of the incident with Dr. Deyoe. Rather, these persons recall plaintiff telling them at different times. (Defendants' statement of facts, ¶ 8; Plaintiff's statement of facts, ¶ 8).   (3) Ms. Bishop stated that in mid-January of 1988, plaintiff became very angry in her presence because another employee was receiving tuition assistance from the Grain Science Department. Ms. Bishop recalled plaintiff saying: ""She gets her tuition paid and all I get is a slap on the butt."" Ms. Bishop further recalled plaintiff saying: ""He's going to pay for this if I don't  get my tuition paid."" Plaintiff denies having made this latter statement. (Defendants' statement of facts, ¶ 9; Plaintiff's statement of facts, ¶ 9).   (4) Dr. Keith Behnke, a professor in Grain Science, stated that during the week of January 25, plaintiff asked Dr. Behnke for a letter of recommendation to the public administration program, and that plaintiff also told Dr. Benke that Dr. Deyoe had hit her on the butt.   Based on Dr. Deyoe's denial of plaintiff's allegations, and that fact that others had not confirmed plaintiff's claim of having brought the December 22 incident to their attention, Dean Woods stated that the University could not conclude whether sexual harassment had occurred. Dean Woods went on to state, however, that if plaintiff's claims had been substantiated, he believed such claims would constitute sexual harassment under University policy. For this reason, Dean Woods sent a letter to Dr. Deyoe, which included the following instructions:     1. That he continue to be professional in his behavior toward [plaintiff] and other employees, and that he pay special attention to conducting himself so that none of his actions can be perceived as sexually harassing.    2. That he avoid any actions that could be perceived as retaliatory toward [plaintiff] for making [the] complaint.    3. That he carefully review the University's policy on sexual harassment.    Dean Woods closed by assuring plaintiff of the University's intention to maintain a non-discriminatory work environment, and by informing plaintiff of her right to review by the Classified Discrimination Review Committee. (Ehts. 10 11 to Defendants' Motion in Support, Doc. 25).   On April 20, 1988, plaintiff brought a formal complaint to the Discrimination Review Committee charging Dr. Deyoe with sexual harassment. In this letter, plaintiff reiterated most of her claims considered by Dean Woods, and further claimed that she was suffering from retaliation in the form of a hostile work atmosphere. On April 28, 1988, plaintiff requested through her attorney that the hearing before the Review Committee be conducted as an open hearing.   Also on April 28, plaintiff wrote to Dr. Deyoe, stating that she was unable to continue working in the present work environment in the office, and requesting a leave of absence without pay, in accordance with University policy. By letter dated April 29, 1988, Dr. Deyoe informed plaintiff that he did not believe the work environment prevented her from fully meeting the responsibilities of her position. Nonetheless, Dr. Deyoe granted plaintiff's request for a leave of absence and also reminded plaintiff that the appointment she was on at that time terminated on June 17, 1988.   On May 5, 1988, the Review Committee, chaired by Professor Robin Higham, held an open hearing on plaintiff's complaint. At the hearing, plaintiff called Kim Hoffman, who had been an employee in the Grain Science Department from June 4, 1985 until May 19, 1986. Hoffman testified that during her employment as Charles Deyoe's secretary, she and Dr. Deyoe had had a conversation in which she had asked for time off to attend the Kansas Artificial Insemination School. During this conversation, Dr. Deyoe made joking comments about artificial insemination and said to her: ""I'm going to inseminate you."" Hoffman also testified that June Bishop told Dr. Deyoe of Hoffman's distress over his comments, and that the next day Dr. Deyoe apologized to Hoffman that his comments had offended her. Hoffman also testified that Dr. Deyoe had asked her: ""What would you do if I hit you on the butt,"" but that she had ""never really considered it a threat until [plaintiff] called her."" (Defendants' statement of facts, ¶ 18). Hoffman also testified that she had participated in telling jokes in the department and to Dr. Deyoe, some of which were sexually explicit.   On May 11, 1988, the Discrimination Review Committee sent to President Jon Wefald the following findings and recommendations:    FINDINGS:     The committee's findings are broken down into two categories: those relating to the complaint of sexual harassment, and those relating to the retaliation as a result of the filing of a sexual harassment complaint.    I. Sexual harassment Complaint     a. There is insufficient evidence to establish that the alleged 22 December 1987 incident actually occurred.    b. Dr. Deyoe did on the occasions engage in impermissible language and inappropriate actions. Specifically, we concluded that:    i. Dr. Deyoe used profanity and improper sexually-explicit language in the office.    ii. Dr. Deyoe inappropriately made direct sexually-explicit statements to a former employee.    iii. Dr. Deyoe inappropriately listened to sexual jokes related to him by a former employee.    iv. Dr. Deyoe failed to discourage his office staff from using profanity and other offensive conversation within the working environment.    II. Retaliation Complaint     There was hostility in the main office of the Department of Grain Science which accelerated with Mrs. Campbell's request for tuition payment and escalated much further after she filed a sexual harassment complaint against Dr. Deyoe.    a. Dr. Deyoe would have been within his rights not to support Mrs. Campbell's tuition payment request. The remission of fees for classified employees is not a well established policy in the department, so his failure to act upon her request is not viewed as an act of retaliation for filing the sexual harassment complaint.    b. Dr. Deyoe was within his prerogative to assign work to classified employees other than his administrative assistant, Mrs. Campbell. However, Dr. Deyoe showed insensitivity to the rights of an employee to file a sexual harassment complaint, but Mrs. Campbell was not sensitive either to Dr. Deyoe's needs.    c. Dr. Deyoe failed to address the obvious escalating hostility developing among some of the classified employees working in the main office. There is no evidence that he took significant steps to remedy the problem.    d. Mrs. Campbell was partly responsible for the growing hostility within the departmental office's working environment. She contributed by not cooperating with other office staff, and on more than one occasion, by accusing Dr. Deyoe of engaging in retaliatory behavior.    e. Mrs. June Bishop, the office supervisor, shared the blame for the growing hostility within the Department because she discussed the case with another employee and made a derogatory remark about the complainant contrary to Dean Wood's direction.    RECOMMENDATIONS     1. That Dr. Deyoe be counseled as to his behavior, language, and lack of sensitivity to the feeling of those around him. That within a suitable time the Dean review the situation in the department to see that the suggested corrective actions have taken place, and continue to monitor the situation until they have. We do not, however, recommend the removal of Dr. Deyoe from his position as Head of the Department.    2. Mrs. Campbell should have restored to her payment for the leave which she has felt forced to take since March 2 when she filed her suit and shall continue to be paid and remain on leave until her contract expires on June 17, 1988.    3. That the working environment in the main office of the Department of Grain Science and Industry be evaluated as soon as possible by an outside team under the auspices of the Affirmative Action Office.    4. That Mrs. June Bishop be admonished for expressing her opinion of the complainant in the sexual harassment charge with another member of the Department of Grain Science and Industry  after being directed by Dean Woods not to discuss the charge.    5. That to avoid the potential acceleration of tensions within the department or unit concerned as was evident in this case, the University's Affirmative Action Plan should be revised to provide a person who brings a complaint (or is named in a complaint) an option to be placed in another working environment until the matter is resolved.    (Report of May 11, 1988 by the Discrimination Review Committee, Eht. 19 to Defendant Motion in Support, Doc. 25).   On June 3, 1988, Kansas State University President, Jon Wefald, concurred with the recommendations of the Discrimination Review Committee. President Wefald asked Dean Woods to carry out the recommendations and to inform him when all recommended action had been taken. By June 21, 1988, Dean Woods had carried out all of the recommendations of the Discrimination Review Committee and reported to President Wefald.   On May 16, 1988, Dean Woods offered to move plaintiff to the Office of the Dean of Agriculture until June 17, 1988, the date on which plaintiff's appointment was to terminate. In this offer, Dean Woods described the work assignment and assured plaintiff that she would have three days of vacation restored and that her pay would remain the same. On May 19, 1988, plaintiff, through her attorney, declined the transfer to the Dean's Office. On June 16, 1988, Dean Walter Woods notified plaintiff that the University intended to offer her a one-year term appointment beginning June 18, 1988, as an administrative assistant in the Library. In his letter he asked her to contact Dr. Brice Hobrock, Dean of Libraries, who would prepare her contract and communicate the responsibilities of the position.   By letter dated June 20, 1988 to Dr. Bobrock, plaintiff declined the offer for the position as administrative assistant in the Library. In this letter, plaintiff explained that she felt that the offer was ""tainted"" because of her sexual harassment complaint. Plaintiff stated that during the course of the interview, she was asked whether she would ""involve the staff in [her] hostilities because the committee had ruled against [her]."" Plaintiff also stated that she was asked whether she would use the position to enlist sympathy for her case. Finally, plaintiff expressed concern that the position was not the equivalent of her position at the Grain Science Department because the library position was funded for only one year. (Eht. 29 to Defendant's Motion in Support). Both Dean Woods and Dean Hobrock replied to plaintiff, assuring her that the position was an equivalent one-year appointment, and that the offer was not in any way ""tainted"" by her having brought a complaint of sexual harassment.   On September 27, 1988, a referee for the Kansas Department of Human Resources concluded that plaintiff had ""failed or refused to accept suitable work without good cause.""   II. Discussion   A. Sexual Harassment   Unlawful employment practices under Title VII include discrimination based on sex that ""'has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.'"" Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404-05, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986) (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1604.11(a)). For claims of sexual harassment based on a ""hostile work environment"" to be actionable, the harassment ""must be sufficiently severe or pervasive 'to alter the conditions of [the victim's] employment and create an abusive working environment.'"" Id. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405 (quoting Henson v. Dundee, 682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982)). See also Ramsey v. City County of Denver, 907 F.2d 1004, 1011 (10th Cir. 1990); Hirschfeld v. New Mexico Corrections Dep't, 916 F.2d 572, 575 (10th Cir. 1990). Sexual harassment need not involve conduct that is explicitly sexual in nature, but may include ""'any harassment or other unequal treatment of an employee or group of employees that would not occur but for the sex of  the employee or employees. . . .'"" Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1413, 1415 (10th Cir. 1987) (quoting McKinney v. Dole, 765 F.2d 1129, 1138 (D.C. Cir. 1985)). See also Laughinghouse v. Risser, 754 F. Supp. 836, 840 (D.Kan. 1990). Whether the challenged conduct rises to an actionable level is a fact-specific question that depends upon the totality of the circumstances. Hicks, 833 F.2d at 1413.   Plaintiff relies on the following evidence to support her claim of a hostile work environment: Dr. Deyoe crowded plaintiff in her office space and made knee to knee contact with her that made her feel uncomfortable; he used obscenities in talking to her about others; he threatened plaintiff at least a half dozen times to slap her on the butt; on December 22, 1987, Dr. Deyoe slapped plaintiff on the butt after she had just delivered a message to him, and plaintiff made it clear that this conduct was unwelcome; in January 1988, Dr. Deyoe told plaintiff that he would hit her again but obviously she did not like it; Dr. Deyoe had previously threatened a former secretary, Kim Hoffman, that he would hit her on the butt and also threatened to inseminate her. (Doc. 28, at 9).    Plaintiff has made no averment that she was aware of Deyoe's actions toward his former secretary. Although the court must consider evidence of sexual harassment against persons other than the plaintiff in passing on a claim of hostile work environment sexual harassment, see Hicks, 833 F.2d at 1416, the past incidents related by Hoffman, of which plaintiff apparently had no knowledge, could not have contributed to the hostility that she perceived in the Department. Nonetheless, Hoffman's allegations of past sexual harassment from Deyoe are relevant to the credibility of Deyoe's denial of plaintiff's allegations. See Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).   Defendants dispute that any of the alleged conduct of Dr. Deyoe ""had much to do with the fact that plaintiff is female."" Doc. 25, at 19. The court cannot agree. Wherever else such conduct might be acceptable, a slap on the buttocks in the office setting has yet to replace the hand shake, and the court is confident that such conduct, when directed from a man towards a woman, occurs precisely and only because of the parties' respective gender.   Defendants also contend that the alleged conduct does not constitute sexual harassment under Title VII as a matter of law. The court finds that plaintiff's allegations, although minimal, are sufficient to create an issue of fact regarding the existence of actionable sexual harassment. See Mahoney v. Driscoll, 727 F. Supp. 50, 52 (D.Mass. 1989) (allegations of threats on two occasions plus intimidating work environment sufficient to state claim).   Finally, the defendant University challenges plaintiff's sexual harassment claim on the ground that it cannot be held accountable for the actions of Deyoe. A prima facia case of hostile work environment sexual harassment against an employer requires a showing of harassment by the employer itself or by an employee whose acts may be imputed to the employer under some agency theory. See Henson v. City of Dundee, 682 F.2d 897, 905 n. 9 (11th Cir. 1982); Halasi-Schmick v. City of Shawnee, 759 F. Supp. 747, 751 (D.Kan. 1991). There is no allegation that Dr. Deyoe was plaintiff's actual employer, and the University's liability must therefore be based on an agency theory.   In Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1417-18 (10th Cir. 1987), the court examined three agency principles under Restatement (Second) of Agency § 219 (1958) as possible bases for subjecting an employer to liability for its agent's acts of sexual harassment: (1) acts within the scope of the agent's employment; (2) employer negligence or recklessness in failing to respond to complaints of sexual harassment; and (3) tortious acts within the scope of the agent's apparent authority, or acts whose accomplishment is aided by the existence of the agency relationship. Because the first of these is largely irrelevant to employer liability under Title VII, Hicks, 833 F.2d at 1418, the court examines plaintiff's claim under the second and third agency theories.   1. Employer Negligence or Recklessness   In the context of claims of sexual harassment, employer negligence or recklessness  ""is defined as 'failing to remedy or prevent a hostile or offensive work environment of which management-level employees knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known.'"" Hirschfeld v. New Mexico Corrections Dep't, 916 F.2d 572, 577 (10th Cir. 1990) (quoting EEOC v. Hacienda Hotel, 881 F.2d 1504, 1516 (9th Cir. 1989)). Plaintiff alleges two separate sets of inaction on the part of the University that would expose the University to direct liability for its negligence or recklessness. See id. at 577 n. 5 (distinguishing between derivative liability under respondeat superior and direct liability for negligence or recklessness); Baker v. Weyerhaeuser Co., 903 F.2d 1342, 1346 (10th Cir. 1990). First, plaintiff contends that the University failed to act to remedy Deyoe's conduct prior to plaintiff's formal complaint of February 18, 1988. Second, plaintiff alleges that the University's response to her formal complaint was inadequate. The court addresses these allegations in turn.   a. University Inaction Before Formal Complaint   Plaintiff charges that the University was ""negligent or reckless in allowing Charles Deyoe to not only bully and threaten one secretary but to continue such behavior, including a physical attack on Carla Campbell."" (Doc. 28, at 14). Although plaintiff did not file a formal complaint until February 18, 1988 which the University thereafter acted upon, the University may not escape liability by belatedly correcting an employee's harassing conduct when it might reasonably have been expected to take such corrective action earlier. See Baker, 903 F.2d at 1348 (employer who knew of previous harassing conduct should have fired known sex maniac earlier). Before defendant can be said to have negligently or recklessly ""allowed"" Deyoe to commit these acts, however, plaintiff must make some showing that defendant had knowledge of Deyoe's conduct. ""The employee can demonstrate that the employer knew of the harassment by showing that she complained to higher management of the harassment, or by showing the pervasiveness of the harassment, which gives rise to the inference of knowledge or constructive knowledge."" Henson, 682 F.2d at 905 (citations omitted). See also Huddleston v. Roger Dean Chevrolet, Inc., 845 F.2d 900, 904 (11th Cir. 1988); Robinson v. Jacksonville Shipyards, Inc., 760 F. Supp. 1486, 1529 (M.D.Fla. 1991).   There is only limited evidence that — prior to plaintiff's formal complaint brought on February 18, 1988 — University personnel other than plaintiff and Deyoe had any knowledge of Dr. Deyoe's alleged sexually harassing conduct: (1) plaintiff alleges that she told Deanna Selby and June Bishop, the office supervisor, of the December 22, 1987 incident the day after it occurred, and told Dr. Keith Benke of the incident during the week of January 25, 1988; (2) plaintiff also alleges that Kim Hoffman, the former secretary, had previously told June Bishop of Deyoe's conduct. Although plaintiff offers no evidence that any of these fellow employees had any management-level authority, plaintiff attaches an excerpt from the ""University's Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment."" Under the heading ""WHOSE RESPONSIBILITY IS IT TO PREVENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT FROM OCCURRING?"" the Policy states:     it is the obligation of supervisors and administrators to prevent sexual harassment from occurring or continuing. To that end, it is essential that administrators and supervisors become aware of the nature of sexual harassment and fully familiar with the University's ""Policy Prohibiting Sexual Harassment,"" and that they transmit this information to those faculty and staff in their areas of responsibility.    (Eht. 1, Plaintiff's Memo in Opposition, Doc. 28) (emphasis added). Regardless of whether Selby, Benke, or Bishop can be  considered management-level authority, the University's Policy indicates that supervisors such as Bishop, in addition to administrators, had the responsibility to respond to complaints of sexual harassment. Thus, an issue of fact exists regarding whether the University can be charged with knowledge of the incidents of harassment occurring before plaintiff filed her formal complaint.     The version of the University's Policy that is attached to defendant's motion in support contains no similar provision. See Doc. 23, Eht. 1 at p. 2, ¶¶ A.1., A.2.   Defendants point out in their reply memorandum that plaintiff's deposition testimony disavowed any expectation of corrective action from Dr. Benke. (""Attachment A"" to Doc. 29). According to this testimony, plaintiff told Dr. Benke of her complaint against Deyoe only with the expectation that he ""be a listener."" Id.    b. Inadequacy of University's Response   The second manner in which the University is alleged to have been negligent is in its response to plaintiff's complaint. Remedial actions taken by an employer with knowledge of sexual harassment must be both prompt and ""'reasonably calculated to end the harassment. . . .'"" Sanchez v. City of Miami Beach, 720 F. Supp. 974, 981 (S.D.Fla. 1989) (quoting Katz v. Dole, 709 F.2d 251, 256 (4th Cir. 1983)). Plaintiff contends that the University ""knew"" what happened to her, but did nothing except hear her complaint. Plaintiff suggests several omissions on the part of the University: Dean Woods failed to reprimand Deyoe; Dean Woods should have offered to remove plaintiff to another University position away from Deyoe pending resolution of her complaint — which became the general University policy as a result of plaintiff's complaint; Dean Woods should have spoken to Kim Hoffman about the sexual abuse she allegedly suffered at the hands of Deyoe; Dean Woods should have given plaintiff the opportunity to discuss with him the information he had gathered from others before issuing his report; the Discrimination Review Committee failed to determine the facts based on the credibility of the witnesses; and the Committee ""should have anticipated opposing testimony and made provision to protect the complaining party rather than defend the alleged harasser."" (Plaintiff's Opposition in Response, Doc. 28, at 17).   The University's response to plaintiff's complaint was tempered by the fact that both Dean Jones and the Discrimination Committee found ""insufficient evidence"" to support plaintiff's allegation of the December 22 incident. See Swentek v. USAir, Inc., 830 F.2d 552, 558 (4th Cir. 1987) (employer is required to investigate but not necessarily credit plaintiff's allegations of sexual harassment). Nonetheless, Dean Jones sent a letter to Dr. Deyoe that admonished him to refrain from any action that might be perceived as sexually harassing or as retaliatory towards plaintiff for making the complaint, and to review the University's policy on sexual harassment. After conducting its own hearing at which plaintiff was allowed to present evidence and call witnesses, the Committee found specific instances of inappropriate conduct by Dr. Deyoe, recommended counseling for him, and charged Dean Jones with the responsibility to ensure that the recommended corrective action be implemented. Plaintiff presents no evidence of sexual harassment after the University responded. See Hirschfeld, 916 F.2d at 578 (important that no complaints followed after demotion of harasser).   The comprehensiveness of the University's response weighs heavily in favor of a finding that the University promptly and effectively remedied plaintiff's allegations of harassment. The summary judgment motion, however, is rarely an appropriate vehicle for assessing the reasonableness of an employer's response to complaints of sexual harassment. Given this, plus the court's finding that other issues remain for trial, the court believes ""that the better course would be to proceed to a full trial."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).   2. Acts Aided by Existence of Agency Relationship   Under § 219(2)(d) of the Restatement (Second) of Agency, a principal will be liable for the acts of his servant if ""the servant purported to act or to speak on behalf of the principal and there was  reliance upon apparent authority, or he was aided in accomplishing the tort by the existence of the agency relation."" (emphasis added). In Hirschfeld v. New Mexico Corrections Dep't, 916 F.2d 572, 579 (10th Cir. 1990), the court held that Title VII employer liability may not be based upon § 219(2)(d) of the Restatement where the wrongdoer had no supervisory authority over plaintiff. In this case, however, it is undisputed that Deyoe was the direct supervisor of plaintiff, and viewing matters in a light most favorable to plaintiff the court cannot say that Deyoe did not invoke his supervisory authority ""in order to facilitate his harassment of plaintiff."" 916 F.2d at 579. Thus, the court concludes that § 219(2)(d) is also a potentially viable theory for imposing liability on the University for Deyoe's actions.   B. Retaliation   Defendants move for summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of retaliation in violation of Title VII. Plaintiff contends that in retaliation for filing her complaint with the University, and later with the EEOC, she suffered several adverse employment actions at the hands of defendants: she was forced to continue working with her harasser; Deyoe and Bishop refused to communicate with her, making her job difficult and ultimately forcing her to request a leave of absence without pay; she was told by Deyoe that her contract with the University terminated in June 1988; and she was offered an inferior temporary position in the Library.   Retaliation against an employee who engages in activity protected under Title VII is made unlawful under § 704(a) of Title VII, which provides in part:     It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees or applicants for employment, . . . because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this, or because he has made a charge, testified, asserted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this title.  42 U.S.C. § 2000e-3(a). A prima facie case of retaliation in violation of Title VII requires that the plaintiff show: ""1) she engaged in protected opposition to discrimination or participation in a proceeding arising out of discrimination; 2) adverse action by the employer subsequent to the protected activity; and 3) a causal connection between the employee's activity and the adverse action."" Archuleta v. Colorado Dep't of Institutions, 936 F.2d 483, 486 (10th Cir. 1991). Plaintiff's claim is based on activity falling within the ""opposition clause"" of the statute, which protects activity other than participation in EEOC hearings. See Allen v. Denver Public School Bd., 928 F.2d 978, 985 (10th Cir. 1991) (retaliation for filing grievance with teacher's association cognizable under § 704(a)). A person who engages in activity protected under the opposition clause of § 704(a) need not prove that the discrimination she opposed actually occurred, but only that she had a good faith belief that Title VII had been violated. Love v. Re/Max of Am., Inc., 738 F.2d 383, 385 (10th Cir. 1984). See also Blizzard v. Newport News Redevelopment Housing Auth., 670 F. Supp. 1337, 1344 (E.D.Va. 1984) (although opposition clause requires reasonable belief, participation clause grants absolute privilege). Thus, plaintiff's lack of success on the original charge of discrimination does not defeat a claim of retaliation under § 704(a). Archuleta, 936 F.2d at 486-87.   Defendants argue that plaintiff's claims of retaliation are not cognizable under Title VII because no economically adverse employment action was taken against her. Defendants characterize plaintiff's grievances as nothing more than petty miscommunications and minor annoyances that indicate, at most, Deyoe's uncomfortableness in working with plaintiff after she filed her complaint.   In Drez v. E.R. Squibb Sons, Inc., 674 F. Supp. 1432, 1436-39 (D.Kan. 1987), Judge Saffels ruled that a plaintiff sustaining no economic injury from job harassment nonetheless has a claim under the ADEA's anti-retaliation provision, if the retaliatory harassment was sufficiently severe under  the ""hostile work environment"" standard of Vinson. See also Curl v. Reavis, 740 F.2d 1323, 1329 n. 5 (4th Cir. 1984) (filing of EEOC charge may well engender disruption in work place, but Congress elected to protect such persons from retaliation). The court need not decide whether this might applying equally to Title VII retaliation, however, because plaintiff also alleges that the office hostility became sufficiently severe to prompt her to request leave without pay, and that Deyoe refused to renew her contract in retaliation for her complaint. Thus, the allegations state adverse economic employment actions of a type prohibited by Title VII.   C. Discharge   Plaintiff alleges that she was either terminated or constructively discharged for making her complaint. Defendant challenges both of these claims, which the court addresses in turn.   1. Actual Discharge   Although plaintiff's contract expired on June 17, 1988, plaintiff contends that she was effectively terminated from a position that would have continued had she not brought a harassment complaint against Dr. Deyoe. Defendant relies on language in plaintiff's contract, which states: ""It is understood that this appointment carries with it no expectation of continuing employment and no consideration for tenure, and that the standards of notice of non-reappointment do not apply."" (Eht. 7 to Defendant's Motion in Support, Doc. 25). Defendant argues that by virtue of this contractual provision, the University was not obligated to reappoint plaintiff as an administrative assistant.   Be that as it may, plaintiff has alleged that the decision not to reappoint her was motivated, in part or in whole, by her complaint against Deyoe. Notwithstanding the absence of any contractual ""obligation"" on the part of defendants to reappoint plaintiff, or even of an expectation of employment rising to the level of a property interest protected by due process, § 704(a) prohibits an employer from taking retaliatory adverse employment actions against ""any of his employees or applicants for employment, . . . ."" (emphasis added). Proof of a causal connection between plaintiff's protected activity and the University's failure to reappoint her would constitute a violation of a statutory duty that may not be avoided by contract.   2. Constructive Discharge   Alternatively, plaintiff claims that the hostile working environment, the failure to reappoint her to her previous position, and the offer an inferior employment position led to her constructive discharge from the University. ""[T]he question on which constructive discharge cases turn is simply whether the employer by its illegal discriminatory acts has made working conditions so difficult that a reasonable person in the employee's position would feel compelled to resign."" Derr v. Gulf Oil Corp., 796 F.2d 340, 344 (10th Cir. 1986). See also Ramsey v. City County of Denver, 907 F.2d 1004, 1010 (10th Cir. 1990); Spulak v. K Mart Corp., 894 F.2d 1150, 1154 (10th Cir. 1990). Defendant contends that it was unreasonable for plaintiff to refuse the offer to work in the Library, and that in any event plaintiff had told her counselor in May 12, 1988 that she did not intend to work at the University again.   The court finds that material issues of fact exist regarding whether defendants' alleged discriminatory and retaliatory acts made plaintiff's working conditions so difficult that she reasonably felt compelled to request leave and subsequently refused any further employment at the University. The court also finds that the statement to plaintiff's counselor only presents an issue of fact regarding whether plaintiff herself or the University's alleged retaliatory actions were the cause of her loss of employment at the University. See Unified School Dist. No. 457 v. Phifer, 729 F. Supp. 1298, 1304 (D.Kan. 1990) (plaintiff's resignation defeated liberty interest claim). Defendants' motion on the constructive discharge claim will therefore be denied.    D. Due Process   Plaintiff argues that she had a continued right to employment at the University protected by procedural safeguards of due process that were not observed in her case.    Although not addressed by the parties, the court notes that plaintiff's due process claim directly against Kansas State University, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, is barred by the eleventh amendment. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 677, 94 S.Ct. 1347, 1362, 39 L.Ed.2d 662 (1974); Quern v. Jordan, 440 U.S. 332, 338-40, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 1143-45, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979); Alabama v. Pugh, 438 U.S. 781, 98 S.Ct. 3057, 57 L.Ed.2d 1114 (1978) (per curiam); Billings v. Wichita State Univ., 557 F. Supp. 1348, 1350 (D.Kan. 1983). The University also enjoys eleventh amendment immunity from plaintiff's pendent state claims. Pennhurst State School Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 120-21, 104 S.Ct. 900, 918-19, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984). Nonetheless, the court considers the due process claims against Deyoe and Bishop to be claims against them in their individual capacity for their actions taken under color of state law. See Kentucky v. Graham, 473 U.S. 159, 165-67, 105 S.Ct. 3099, 3104-06, 87 L.Ed.2d 114 (1985).   Property interests within the procedural guaranties of the fourteenth amendment are not created by that provision, but rather derive from independent sources such as state law. Cleveland Bd. of Education v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 1491, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985). ""Property interests 'arise from sources such as state statutes, local ordinances, established rules, or mutually explicit understandings.'"" Abercrombie v. City of Catoosa, 896 F.2d 1228, 1231 (10th Cir. 1990) (quoting Dickeson v. Quarberg, 844 F.2d 1435, 1437 (10th Cir. 1988)). In Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972), the Court found no procedurally protected property interest for a non-tenured University teacher under a fixed term of employment. Because ""the terms of [the teacher's] appointment secured absolutely no interest in reemployment,"" nor ""was there any state statute or University rule or policy that secured his interest in re-employment or that created any legitimate claim to it,"" the teacher had no property interest requiring any hearing. Id. 408 U.S. at 578, 92 S.Ct. at 2710.   Plaintiff presents the court with nothing more than a unilateral expectation of continued employment that has no basis in state law or University policy. See Roth, 408 U.S. at 577, 92 S.Ct. at 2709 (plaintiff must have more than abstract need or unilateral expectation). Plaintiff apparently attempts to construct an implied contract of continued employment from the University's past practice. Although ""agreements implied from 'the promisor's words and conduct in the light of the surrounding circumstances'"" can be sources of property interests, Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 601-02, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2700, 33 L.Ed.2d 570 (1972), ""[a] property interest . . . cannot be inferred from a consistent practice without some basis in state law."" Regents of University of Michigan v. Ewing, 474 U.S. 214, 223 n. 9, 106 S.Ct. 507, 512 n. 9, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985). See also Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 430, 102 S.Ct. 1148, 1154-55, 71 L.Ed.2d 265 (1982).   In the absence of controlling contractual provisions, Kansas law allows for the creation of implied contracts of employment under certain conditions. See Enstrom v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 712 F. Supp. 841, 851-52 (D.Kan. 1989). In this case, however, the express terms of plaintiff's contract foreclose such an argument. ""In determining the rights which occur under an employment contract, the entitlement thereto or eligibility therefor, the terms of the contract control so long as they are not unreasonable or illegal."" Weinzirl v. Wells Group, Inc., 234 Kan. 1016, 1019, 677 P.2d 1004 (1984). Plaintiff's contract of employment expressly states that her appointment was to terminate on June 17, 1988, and that it carried with it no expectation of continued employment. Cf. Morriss v. Coleman Co., 241 Kan. 501, 514, 738 P.2d 841, 849 (1987) (express disclaimer in employee handbook does not preclude finding of implied contract of employment). Thus, although plaintiff may have had a desire or expectation of continued employment, this expectation carried no claim of legitimacy entitling it to the protections of due process. See Hullman v. Board of  Trustees of Pratt Community College, 725 F. Supp. 1536, 1548 (D.Kan. 1989) (""Serial reemployment pursuant to one-year contracts does not establish a legitimate expectation in continued employment."").   IT IS BY THE COURT THEREFORE ORDERED that defendants' motion for summary judgment (Doe. 24) on plaintiff's claim of sexual harassment, retaliation, and constructive discharge be denied.   IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that defendants' motion for summary judgment (Doe. 24) on plaintiff's due process claim be granted.   "
https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/159/504/616492/,"This is a consolidation of seven separate appeals spawned by one district court case. Professor Emil Tonkovich, a law professor at the University of Kansas School of Law (""the Law School""), filed a complaint challenging his dismissal, alleging under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 that the University violated his First Amendment speech rights, and his Fourteenth Amendment due process and equal protection rights. He also alleged several state claims, which are not before us. Although the district court granted the defendants' motions to dismiss based on qualified immunity with respect to the First Amendment claim, it denied the motions to dismiss the Fourteenth Amendment claims. The defendants appeal this partial denial of their motions to dismiss, asserting their entitlement to qualified and absolute immunity. Because we resolve these appeals on qualified immunity grounds, we need not reach the issue of absolute immunity. Even taking Professor Tonkovich's allegations as true, they are insufficient to show that the defendants subjected him, or caused him to be subjected, to the violation of a clearly established right of constitutional dimension. Thus, we reverse the district court's denial of qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection claims. On appeal from a motion to dismiss, we must accept all of the well-pleaded allegations in the complaint as true. Albright v. Oliver, 510 U.S. 266, 268, 114 S. Ct. 807, 127 L. Ed. 2d 114 (1994). However, we need not accept conclusory allegations. Swanson v. Bixler, 750 F.2d 810, 813 (10th Cir. 1984). We must liberally construe the pleadings and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the plaintiff. Id. Accordingly, the facts recited herein are gleaned from Professor Tonkovich's first amended complaint.  As we analyze the issues presented by the doctrine of qualified immunity, which we shall discuss below in greater detail, we are guided by the Supreme Court's statement of our task: An appellate court reviewing the denial of the defendant's claim of immunity need not consider the correctness of the plaintiff's version of the facts, nor even determine whether the plaintiff's allegations actually state a claim. All it need determine is a question of law: whether the legal norms allegedly violated by the defendant were clearly established at the time of the challenged actions.... Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 527-28, 105 S. Ct. 2806, 86 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1985). Professor Tonkovich was employed as a faculty member at the Law School beginning in August 1981. In 1986, he became a tenured faculty member. In 1991, a graduating law student (""the Law Student"") complained that, during her first year of law school, Professor Tonkovich had engaged in a sexual act with her after discussing her grades. Officials in the Chancellor's office conducted an investigation, enlisting the assistance of various Law School faculty members and the Dean of the Law School. During the investigation, the Chancellor's office issued written findings and recommendations regarding the appropriate disciplinary action to be taken in Professor Tonkovich's case. A period of settlement negotiations ensued. Eventually, the Chancellor filed official written charges against Professor Tonkovich. An evidentiary hearing was conducted before a standing University Hearing Committee, which issued its decision and recommendation to the Chancellor, who dismissed Professor Tonkovich from the faculty in 1993. Professor Tonkovich then took an appeal to the Board of Regents. What follows are the details of the events surrounding Professor Tonkovich's dismissal, which form the basis of his claims. In May 1991, just after her graduation from the Law School, the Law Student went to Robert Jerry, Dean of the Law School, and complained that Professor Tonkovich had made a pass at her in the fall of 1988. Dean Jerry informed Professor Tonkovich that a female student had complained about his conduct. However, he did not name the student, nor did he provide any details about the nature of the allegation. Professor Tonkovich denied misconduct and asked to confront his accuser. During July and August 1991, Professor Tonkovich repeatedly requested that Dean Jerry disclose the name of his accuser and the nature of the allegation, but the Dean refused to do so. In August 1991, the Law Student filed a formal written statement with Vice Chancellor P. Delbert Brinkman, alleging that in July 1988, when she was a first-year law student, she had engaged in a sexual act with Professor Tonkovich, who was her professor at the time, and that the act was preceded by a discussion of law school grades. That same day, a local television news crew came to the Law School. The station later aired a segment about allegations of sexual misconduct against various law professors, who were not named. Later that day, Professor Tonkovich learned the name of his accuser. Shortly after the Law Student filed her written statement, Law Professor Elinor Schroeder told Vice Chancellor Brinkman that some faculty members thought the Law Student was unstable and that the accusations were part of a conspiracy against Professor Tonkovich. The University established September 6, 1991 as the deadline for submitting complaints against Professor Tonkovich. Professor Tonkovich's response, filed on September 9th, denied the Law Student's allegation and denied sexually harassing any student. Two days later, he submitted an affidavit of Jean Younger, one of the Law Student's classmates. Ms. Younger had hosted the party that preceded the alleged sexual activity. Ms. Younger stated (and later testified at the hearing) that at the party, the Law Student was flirting with Professor Tonkovich. The following is Professor Tonkovich's version of the events that took place on the evening of the party. The Law Student followed him around the party for approximately five hours. She flirted with him, but he did not return her flirtations. When Professor Tonkovich left the party, she followed him out. She asked him for a ride home, claiming she was too drunk to drive. However, she did not appear too drunk to drive. He agreed to drive her home, but he was concerned that she had romantic intentions. He suggested that they go for a drive. He drove her to the campus police department parking lot where they got out and took a walk. During their walk, she attempted to kiss him. When they returned to the car, she attempted to sit in the driver's seat with him. When Professor Tonkovich said they should go, she became upset. He then drove her back to her car, dropped her off, and left. He did not have sex with her, nor did he discuss grades with her.  During the course of the investigation, in September 1991, Dean Jerry issued a memorandum to the Law School faculty, stating that the guidelines of the Association of American Law Schools apply to the faculty. In particular, Dean Jerry pointed out the guideline concerning the inappropriateness of a professor engaging in sexual conduct with a student enrolled in his or her class. Dean Jerry's memo stated that the guidelines were relevant to the ethics provision of the University's Faculty Code of Conduct (""Faculty Code""). The Faculty Code in effect at the time the Law Student filed her statement, and at the time of the alleged incident, did not expressly prohibit sexual relations between a professor and a student enrolled in his or her class. The Faculty Code did, however, prohibit a professor from exploiting a student for the professor's private advantage. During Professor Tonkovich's tenure, six members of the Law School faculty had dated students. Several days after Dean Jerry issued this memo, Professor Tonkovich received Vice Chancellor Brinkman's written findings. Based on the Law Student's allegation, Vice Chancellor Brinkman found that Professor Tonkovich had violated the Faculty Code's ethics provision. Vice Chancellor Brinkman recommended a one-year paid teaching suspension for this violation. When Professor Tonkovich received the written findings, he was warned that repeating such behavior in the future would be cause for his dismissal from the University. Several days later, Executive Vice Chancellor Delbert Shankel formally adopted Vice Chancellor Brinkman's written findings. Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel informed Professor Tonkovich that if past misconduct were brought to the University's attention, it might be cause for further disciplinary action. The next day, Chancellor Gene Budig adopted Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel's decision. On October 4th, Professor Tonkovich formally requested a hearing before the Committee on Tenure and Related Problems (""the Hearing Committee""). Shortly after Professor Tonkovich requested a hearing, General Counsel to the Board of Regents called the Hearing Committee's chairman, Professor William Lawrence. During their conversation, they discussed recusals from the committee. After this conversation, Professor Lawrence and two other members of the standing committee recused themselves. Three other professors were substituted. The conversation, the recusals, and the substitutions occurred without Professor Tonkovich's knowledge. Professor H. Rutherford Turnbull, III, a substituted member, became the new chairman. Other members of the Hearing Committee were Professors Nancy Ann Dahl, E.P. Johnsen, John Michel, and Delores Ringer. None of the Hearing Committee members were members of the Law School faculty. Mr. Turnbull and one of the other substituted members of the Hearing Committee, Professor Dahl, eventually voted with the 3-2 majority in favor of Professor Tonkovich's dismissal. In October 1991, a few weeks after Professor Tonkovich requested a hearing, the University's newspaper, the University Daily Kansan, reported that a University employee (not a party to this appeal) had referred to Professor Tonkovich as a ""faggot"" in his conversations with reporters. As a result of this and the publicity generated when the local television station had aired its news segment, Professor Tonkovich requested an investigation into how the information was leaked to the press. The University denied his request. On October 31, 1991, Law School faculty members Sidney Shapiro, A. Kimberly Dayton, Reginald Robinson, Ellen Sward, Elinor Schroeder, and Sandra McKenzie signed a letter (""the Letter"") asking that students report any misconduct or sexual harassment by faculty members. Professor Shapiro drafted the Letter at the request of a University administrator. The Letter did not mention Professor Tonkovich by name. After Dean Jerry approved the Letter, it was distributed to students. Professor Tonkovich did not know of the Letter or that the University was soliciting additional complaints against him. Throughout the solicitation process, various people, including Professors Shapiro and Schroeder, told others that the Law Student's allegations against Professor Tonkovich included an allegation of rape.  In December 1991, Professors Shapiro, Robinson, Dayton, and Sward met with Chancellor Budig, Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel, and Ann Victoria Thomas, University General Counsel, to discuss the case against Professor Tonkovich. During December 1991 and January 1992, some of these law professors accompanied students (""the complainants"") to the University's Office of Academic Affairs, where the complainants presented allegations regarding Professor Tonkovich to University officials. Associate Vice Chancellor David Shulenburger interviewed these complainants, and, after completing the interviews, he recommended Professor Tonkovich's dismissal, which is the sanction Professor Tonkovich ultimately faced when the charging documents were filed. Professor Tonkovich requested copies of the complainants' written statements. Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel told Professor Tonkovich that the complainants had not provided written statements. University Associate General Counsel Rose A. Marino denied having any knowledge of written statements submitted by complainants. As the investigation progressed, in December 1991, Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel and Vice Chancellor Brinkman told Professor Tonkovich that if he did not ""resign quietly,"" he would be suspended from teaching, and a letter would be placed in his file to the effect that he posed a risk of substantial harm to students. Professor Tonkovich, who had continued teaching pending his administrative hearing, refused to resign. The University placed him on teaching leave. Shortly thereafter, Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel and Vice Chancellor Brinkman communicated with Professor Tonkovich's attorney, stating that there were no terms acceptable to the University that would allow Professor Tonkovich to continue as a faculty member. Several weeks later, in March 1992, Vice Chancellor Brinkman and Dean Jerry sent Professor Tonkovich a letter, reminding him that Board of Regents regulations did not allow payment of salary when a faculty member was dismissed for moral turpitude. This letter also informed Professor Tonkovich that Vice Chancellor Brinkman and Dean Jerry were recommending that he be charged with moral turpitude, which carried a sanction of dismissal. The following day, Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel concurred in Vice Chancellor Brinkman's and Dean Jerry's recommendation. In March 1992, Professor Tonkovich filed a complaint against various University administrators. He requested a stay in the investigation, recusal of the administrators, and appointment of independent investigators. The University denied his requests. On April 17, 1992, Chancellor Budig filed the University's formal written complaint against Professor Tonkovich. The complaint set forth charges of ethics violations, sexual harassment, and moral turpitude. The complaint contained a proposed sanction of dismissal. One week after the University filed the complaint, the University newspaper ran an article about the Law Student's allegation against Professor Tonkovich. The article named Professor Tonkovich but did not name the Law Student. Certain charges in the complaint were based upon allegations made by the additional student complainants. Several of the female students who were named in the allegations submitted affidavits that the allegations were false and that Professor Tonkovich had done nothing improper. These same students also submitted a letter requesting that the allegations involving them be dismissed. Nevertheless, the University prosecuted these charges. After receiving the formal complaint, Professor Tonkovich made repeated discovery requests, including requests for written statements from the complainants, which the University initially denied. However, on July 24, 1992, the Hearing Committee ordered discovery. Although the written complainants' statements that Professor Tonkovich had requested were not disclosed at this time, Professor Tonkovich was given summaries of them. The University did not produce an alleged tape-recorded interview between University officials and the Law Student that served as the basis of the article printed by the University newspaper shortly after the University filed its complaint against Professor Tonkovich. In addition, many of the University's witnesses, including the Law Student, declined to be interviewed by Professor Tonkovich's attorney prior to testifying. On August 27, 1992, the administrative hearing concerning the University's complaint against Professor Tonkovich began. Ms. Marino prosecuted the case on behalf of the University, presenting witnesses in support of the allegations in the complaint. Professor Tonkovich was present and represented by an attorney, who cross-examined the University's witnesses and presented witnesses on Professor Tonkovich's behalf. The Hearing Committee presided. The hearing was conducted in public at Professor Tonkovich's request. The hearing lasted until May 12, 1993, with sessions held once a week during the school year. At the hearing, during his cross-examination of one of the University's witnesses, Professor Tonkovich learned that at least one of the complainants had, indeed, provided a written statement. At Professor Tonkovich's request, the Hearing Committee sent a letter to the Law School faculty seeking any written statements. None were forthcoming. When Professor Tonkovich called Professor Dayton as a witness, she testified that she had received a written statement from a complainant but that she had discarded it. Professor Robinson also testified that he received approximately five written statements from complainants. He further testified that he received the statements in sealed envelopes, that he never opened them, and that he later threw them away. A week after she testified, Professor Dayton sent a letter to the Hearing Committee stating that she possessed the written statements of four complainants. She proceeded to turn these statements over to the Hearing Committee. Among them was a statement addressed to Professor Robinson. The Hearing Committee denied Professor Tonkovich's request to recall Professor Dayton as a witness. At Professor Tonkovich's request, the Hearing Committee sent certified letters to all of the complainants who had previously testified, asking them to produce their written statements. Two of the complainants, whose allegations the Hearing Committee ultimately found to constitute Faculty Code violations, did not respond to the request, nor did they return to testify. The Hearing Committee did not compel these witnesses to return to testify, nor did it strike the earlier testimony of these complainants. Professor McKenzie, who had openly dated a law student, declined Professor Tonkovich's request to testify at his hearing. The Hearing Committee did not compel her to testify. However, according to Professor Tonkovich, three law professors who had signed the Letter testified as ""expert"" witnesses on behalf of the University: Professor Schroeder testified about sexual harassment; Professor Sward testified about faculty ethics; and Professor Shapiro testified about due process. On the day before the Law Student was scheduled to testify, Ms. Marino proposed an evidentiary rule prohibiting counsel from inquiring about witnesses' prior sexual conduct. The Hearing Committee adopted this rule. It also adopted a sequestration rule to prevent witnesses who were scheduled to testify from hearing other witnesses' testimony. When cross-examining Ms. Younger, Professor Tonkovich's first witness, Ms. Marino asked if she had ever been sexually intimate with a professor. Ms. Marino also read a transcript of the Law Student's testimony to another University witness who was scheduled to testify. During the 1992-93 academic year, the year in which the hearing took place, Dean Jerry gave Professor Tonkovich a negative annual evaluation and the lowest merit salary increase on the entire Law School faculty. According to Professor Tonkovich, in the previous ten years, he had received excellent evaluations and average or above average salary increases. On May 19, 1993, one week after the hearing concluded, Andrew Ramirez, an attorney representing a University witness, sent a letter to the parties. The letter stated that his client had spoken with Mr. Turnbull several weeks after she testified at the hearing. At the conclusion of their conversation, Mr. Turnbull stated to her, ""I admire your courage in coming forward."" On July 30, 1993, the Hearing Committee issued its opinion. By a 3-2 vote, the Hearing Committee recommended that Professor Tonkovich be dismissed. As to the Law Student's allegation, the Committee found that she and Professor Tonkovich had engaged in a sexual act that was preceded by a discussion of grades. The Committee further found that Professor Tonkovich did not intend to intimidate the Law Student by discussing grades but that she was, nonetheless, intimidated because of the inherent power differential between a student and a professor. The committee concluded that this constituted unethical conduct in violation of the Faculty Code. The Committee also concluded that Professor Tonkovich's behavior constituted sexual harassment in violation of Title VII and Title IX and, as unlawful conduct, constituted moral turpitude under the Faculty Code. The Hearing Committee also found that Professor Tonkovich had violated the ethical provisions of the Faculty Code with another student. This occurred when Professor Tonkovich held a female student's hand while asking her who her favorite professor was. The Committee concluded that although this conduct was unethical, it did not constitute sexual harassment. The Committee further found that Professor Tonkovich's social behavior with respect to various other law students was negligent and constituted unethical conduct under the Faculty Code. On August 3, 1993, Chancellor Budig accepted the Hearing Committee's recommendation and dismissed Professor Tonkovich. The following day, Professor Tonkovich appealed his dismissal to the Kansas Board of Regents (""the Regents""). At this time, the Regents consisted of Robert Caldwell, Tom Hammond, John Hiebert, Karen Krepps, John Montgomery, Phyllis Nolan, Frank Sabatini, and Sidney Warner. On September 15, 1994, the Regents upheld Professor Tonkovich's dismissal. Pursuant to the Act for Judicial Review and Civil Enforcement of Agency Actions, Kan. Stat. Ann. §§ 77-601 et seq., Professor Tonkovich had the opportunity to file an action in Kansas state district court for judicial review of the University's decision. See id. at § 77-609. However, he decided to forego this route, and on April 27, 1995, he filed suit in federal court against the University of Kansas, the University Board of Regents, and approximately thirty-four other defendants in their individual and official capacities, alleging violations of § 1983 and various state laws. In his first amended complaint, Professor Tonkovich averred three § 1983 counts (for violations of his due process, free speech, and equal protection rights), and four state law counts (for breach of employment contract, breach of implied duty of good faith and fair dealing, tortious interference with business relationship, and intentional infliction of emotional distress). All defendants filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (1) and 12(b) (6), asserting various defenses such as Eleventh Amendment immunity, absolute immunity, and qualified immunity. The district court granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motions to dismiss. We shall relate only the district court's rulings with respect to qualified immunity. On the issue of qualified immunity, the district court treated the issues of procedural due process, free speech, and equal protection.  The court found that all of the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's First Amendment free speech claim. However, the court ruled that the individual defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process and equal protection claims. Many of the defendants have attempted to appeal not only the district court's denial of their qualified immunity motions but also the district court's denial of their motions to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b) (6). We believe that these defendants have misunderstood this court's limited jurisdiction at this stage of the litigation. Thus, at this juncture, we embark on a brief discussion of our jurisdiction to hear this appeal. ""The courts of appeals ... shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States...."" 28 U.S.C. § 1291. ""A denial of a motion to dismiss ordinarily may not be appealed because it is not a final decision."" Eastwood v. Department of Corrections, 846 F.2d 627, 629 (10th Cir. 1988). However, the denial of a motion to dismiss based on qualified or absolute immunity is immediately appealable under the Cohen  collateral order doctrine. See Mitchell, 472 U.S.  at 530, 105 S. Ct. 2806 (qualified immunity); Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 742, 102 S. Ct. 2690, 73 L. Ed. 2d 349 (1982) (absolute immunity). In holding the issue of immunity to be appealable under the collateral order doctrine, ""the Court has recognized that a question of immunity is separate from the merits of the underlying action for purposes of the Cohen test even though a reviewing court must consider the plaintiff's factual allegations in resolving the immunity issue."" Johnson v. Fankell, 520 U.S. 911, ---- n. 5, 117 S. Ct. 1800, 1804 n. 5, 138 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1997). Although to a certain extent a qualified immunity analysis overlaps with a 12(b) (6) analysis, we do not have jurisdiction to review the merits of Professor Tonkovich's lawsuit at this time. We turn, then, to a review of the district court's rulings with respect to qualified immunity. We review de novo the denial of a motion based on qualified immunity. Walter v. Morton, 33 F.3d 1240, 1242 (10th Cir. 1994); Eastwood, 846 F.2d  at 629. ""Under the doctrine of qualified immunity, 'government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.' "" Ramirez v. Oklahoma Dep't of Mental Health, 41 F.3d 584, 592 (10th Cir. 1994) (quoting Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 818, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982)); cf. Harris v. Board of Educ. of the City of Atlanta, 105 F.3d 591, 595 (11th Cir. 1997) (""In all but the most exceptional cases, qualified immunity protects government officials performing discretionary functions from the burdens of civil trials and from liability for damages.""). The key to the qualified immunity inquiry is the ""objective reasonableness of the official's conduct in light of the legal rules that were clearly established at the time the action was taken."" Melton v. City of Oklahoma City, 879 F.2d 706, 727 (10th Cir. 1989) (quotations omitted), modified on other grounds, 928 F.2d 920 (10th Cir. 1991). Hearkening back to its pronouncement in Siegert v. Gilley, the Supreme Court has recently stated that the better approach to resolving cases in which the defense of qualified immunity is raised is to determine first whether the plaintiff has alleged a deprivation of a constitutional right at all. Normally, it is only then that a court should ask whether the right allegedly implicated was clearly established at the time of the events in question. County of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, ---- n. 5, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 1714 n. 5, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043 (1998) (citing Siegert v. Gilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232, 111 S. Ct. 1789, 114 L. Ed. 2d 277 (1991) (""A necessary concomitant to the determination of whether the constitutional right asserted by a plaintiff is 'clearly established' at the time the defendant acted is the determination of whether the plaintiff has asserted a violation of a constitutional right at all."")). Thus, we use a two-part framework to analyze the issue of qualified immunity. Latta v. Keryte, 118 F.3d 693, 697-98 (10th Cir. 1997). First, we determine whether the plaintiff has sufficiently alleged that the defendant violated a statutory or constitutional right. Id. at 698. If the answer is yes, then we determine whether the right was clearly established such that a reasonable person in the defendant's position would have known that his or her conduct violated that right. Id.  Ordinarily, in order for a plaintiff to demonstrate that a law is clearly established, ""there must be a Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit decision on point, or the clearly established weight of authority from other courts must have found the law to be as the plaintiff maintains."" Medina v. City and County of Denver, 960 F.2d 1493, 1498 (10th Cir. 1992); see also Anderson v. Creighton, 483 U.S. 635, 640, 107 S. Ct. 3034, 97 L. Ed. 2d 523 (1987) (a right is clearly established if the contours of the right are ""sufficiently clear [so] that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right."") A plaintiff ""must do more than identify in the abstract a clearly established right and allege that the defendant has violated it."" Pueblo Neighborhood Health Centers v. Losavio, 847 F.2d 642, 645 (10th Cir. 1988). A plaintiff ""must articulate the clearly established constitutional right and the defendant's conduct which violated the right with specificity."" Albright v. Rodriguez, 51 F.3d 1531, 1535 (10th Cir. 1995) (quotation omitted); see also Walter, 33 F.3d  at 1242 (""the plaintiff ... has the burden to show with particularity facts and law establishing the inference that the defendants violated a constitutional right.""). ""If the district court denies the defendant qualified immunity, the court should identify on the record the defendant's conduct that violated clearly established law."" Mick v. Brewer, 76 F.3d 1127, 1134 (10th Cir. 1996) (citing Albright, 51 F.3d at 1535). Although of necessity we must consider Professor Tonkovich's factual allegations in resolving the immunity issues, we reiterate that this appeal comes to us on a partial denial of the defendants' motions to dismiss, as opposed to motions for summary judgment. The district court did not, nor shall we, consider whether there is a genuine issue of material fact. Thus, we do not face the appellate jurisdictional problem that may be entangled with a qualified immunity analysis on summary judgment. Cf. Johnson v. Jones, 515 U.S. 304, 319-20, 115 S. Ct. 2151, 132 L. Ed. 2d 238 (1995) (holding that ""a defendant, entitled to invoke a qualified immunity defense, may not appeal a district court's summary judgment order insofar as that order determines whether or not the pretrial record sets forth a 'genuine' issue of fact for trial"") (emphasis added). Instead, as stated above, we must accept the plaintiff's version of the facts as true. With this in mind, we proceed to analyze the issue of qualified immunity with respect to each separate cause of action under § 1983, i.e., alleged violations of procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection rights. A. Are the Defendants Entitled to Qualified Immunity on Professor Tonkovich's Procedural Due Process Claim? Because Professor Tonkovich was a tenured professor, he possessed a property interest deserving of procedural due process protections. Brenna v. Southern Colo. State College, 589 F.2d 475, 476 (10th Cir. 1978); see also Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 576-77, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972). In Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 535, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985), the Supreme Court examined the issue of ""what pretermination process must be accorded a public employee who can be discharged only for cause."" In deciding this issue, the Court balanced the competing interests at stake: ""the private interest in retaining employment, the governmental interest in the expeditious removal of unsatisfactory employees and the avoidance of administrative burdens, and the risk of an erroneous termination."" Id. at 542-43, 105 S. Ct. 1487 (citing Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 335, 96 S. Ct. 893, 47 L. Ed. 2d 18 (1976)). The Court concluded that prior to termination, something less than a full evidentiary hearing is sufficient. Id. at 545, 105 S. Ct. 1487. Thus, the Court held that a ""tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story."" Id. at 546, 105 S. Ct. 1487. The holding in Loudermill rested partially on the availability of a full post-termination hearing under applicable state law. Id.; see also Langley v. Adams County, Colo., 987 F.2d 1473, 1480 (10th Cir. 1993) (""Under Loudermill, the adequacy of pre-termination procedures must be examined in light of available post-termination procedures.""); Calhoun v. Gaines, 982 F.2d 1470, 1476 (10th Cir. 1992) (holding that ""Loudermill established that some form of pretermination hearing, plus a full-blown adversarial post-termination hearing"" are required when a property interest in continued employment is at stake). ""A 'full post-termination hearing' is understood to include the right to representation by an attorney and the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses."" Workman v. Jordan, 32 F.3d 475, 480 (10th Cir. 1994). A fundamental principle of procedural due process is a hearing before an impartial tribunal. See Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 46-47, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975). ""A tribunal is not impartial if it is biased with respect to the factual issues to be decided at the hearing."" Patrick v. Miller, 953 F.2d 1240, 1245 (10th Cir. 1992) (quotation omitted). However, ""a substantial showing of personal bias is required to disqualify a hearing officer or tribunal in order to obtain a ruling that a hearing is unfair."" Corstvet v. Boger, 757 F.2d 223, 229 (10th Cir. 1985). Moreover, "" [b]ecause honesty and integrity are presumed on the part of a tribunal, there must be some substantial countervailing reason to conclude that a decisionmaker is actually biased with respect to factual issues being adjudicated."" Mangels v. Pena, 789 F.2d 836, 838 (10th Cir. 1986) (citation omitted). It is worth noting briefly that, in addition to being governed by constitutional law, Professor Tonkovich's claims are also governed by 42 U.S.C. § 1983 itself. Thus, Professor Tonkovich must satisfy the elements of that statute, which states, in part, Every person who ... subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen ... to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws ... shall be liable to the party injured.... 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (emphasis added). The plain wording of the statute contains an element of causation. In other words, a defendant may not be held liable under § 1983 unless he or she subjected a citizen to the deprivation, or caused a citizen to be subjected to the deprivation. See 1A Martin A. Schwartz  John E. Kirklin, Section 1983 Litigation: Claims and Defenses § 6.3 (3d ed.1997). Professor Tonkovich argues that the University's policies require the following procedural safeguards: (1) notice; (2) discovery; (3) presentation of evidence; (4) confrontation and cross-examination; and (5) an impartial hearing committee. He argues that in denying him these safeguards, the defendants violated his clearly established procedural due process rights. At this juncture, we shall discuss each defendant's (or defendant group's) arguments with respect to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process claim. Professor Tonkovich takes issue with the following actions of Dean Jerry: (1) his initial handling of the Law Student's complaint; (2) his attempt to pass a rule, after the fact, prohibiting student/faculty sexual relations; (3) his denial of a request for a leak investigation; (4) his role in the settlement process; and (5) his negative annual evaluation of Professor Tonkovich. Dean Jerry argues that he is entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process claim because he is not responsible for any alleged defects in the process afforded Professor Tonkovich. In other words, he argues that nothing he did violated any of Professor Tonkovich's clearly established procedural due process rights. We agree. As for Dean Jerry's handling of the Law Student's initial complaint, Professor Tonkovich appears to argue that he did not receive proper notice of the charges against him because Dean Jerry would not immediately disclose the name of the accuser and the details of the allegation. However, Professor Tonkovich does not allege that it was Dean Jerry's duty to notify him of the charges. Moreover, Chancellor Budig did give Professor Tonkovich notice in plenty of time to prepare his defense in response to the charges. Professor Tonkovich next argues that his procedural due process rights were violated because the dean never disclosed the ""blatantly false"" statements that the Law Student allegedly made to a judge for whom she worked. Aple's Brief at 60. According to Professor Tonkovich, the Law Student told the judge who was her employer the following: (1) she had nonconsensual sex with her professor; (2) she told Dean Jerry about it; and (3) the Dean was not responsive. Professor Tonkovich argues that the statement the Law Student made to her employer was false because she had only told Dean Jerry that a professor had made a pass at her. We fail to see how Dean Jerry's failure to relate this conversation to Professor Tonkovich violated Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights. As we have discussed, Professor Tonkovich received sufficient notice of the charges against him, and, in addition, he had the opportunity to cross-examine the Law Student at his hearing. As for the remaining allegations involving Dean Jerry, Professor Tonkovich has failed to explain how any of them might constitute a denial of his procedural due process rights. That is, he has failed to demonstrate how attempting to pass a new faculty code rule, denying a request for a leak investigation, taking part in settlement negotiations, and rendering an unfavorable annual evaluation had anything to do with whether Professor Tonkovich received the process that he was due-notice, an explanation of the charges against him, and an opportunity to respond. Nor has Professor Tonkovich pointed to any clearly established law that stands for the proposition that the sorts of actions taken by Dean Jerry might form the basis of a procedural due process claim. For these reasons, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Dean Jerry's motion to dismiss Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process claim on qualified immunity grounds. 2. Appeal of Regents (Case No. 96-3403) and Hearing Committee (Case No. 96-3404) The Regents and the Hearing Committee members argue that because Professor Tonkovich failed to exercise his right to judicial review he should not now be heard to complain of the violation of his procedural due process rights. In other words, they argue that because Professor Tonkovich was entitled to seek judicial review of the University's decision under Kansas law, Kan. Stat. Ann. § 77-601 et seq., the state provided even more process than an administrative hearing and an appeal to the Board of Regents. Thus, they argue, his procedural due process claim must fail. We reject the argument that Professor Tonkovich's failure to seek judicial review in state court precludes his procedural due process claim. It is beyond dispute that a plaintiff need not exhaust state administrative remedies before filing suit in federal court under § 1983. Patsy v. Board of Regents, 457 U.S. 496, 516, 102 S. Ct. 2557, 73 L. Ed. 2d 172 (1982). However, as we shall discuss below, the availability of an action for judicial review is relevant to the question of what process the state afforded Professor Tonkovich. Professor Tonkovich argues that the Regents and the Hearing Committee members denied him his procedural due process right to an impartial tribunal. He also takes issue with the Hearing Committee members' failure to: (1) order discovery; (2) compel witnesses to appear and testify; and (3) mention evidence favorable to him in their findings. We shall address each contention in turn. Professor Tonkovich first argues that he was denied the right to an impartial tribunal because the Hearing Committee members were not professional hearing officers, they were employed by the University, and they were subordinates of the Chancellor. Furthermore, he argues that the fact that various members of the standing committee recused themselves, and that other members were substituted, demonstrates that the resulting Hearing Committee was biased. In support of this claim, he points to Mr. Turnbull's statement to a witness to the effect that he admired her courage in coming forward to testify. First of all, while the Due Process Clause certainly requires a hearing before an impartial tribunal, Professor Tonkovich has pointed to no law, clearly established or otherwise, that procedural due process includes a right to professional hearing officers or hearing officers not employed by the governmental body or agency taking the adverse action. As to the recusals, one of the substituted Hearing Committee members, Mr. Michel, actually voted against Professor Tonkovich's dismissal. This alone takes the wind out of the sails of Professor Tonkovich's recusal argument. Furthermore, even assuming Mr. Turnbull stated to a witness, ""I admire your courage in coming forward,"" that does not establish the required ""substantial showing of personal bias."" Corstvet, 757 F.2d  at 229. The Hearing Committee members argue that there is nothing indicating that they had a personal or financial stake in the decision, which might create a conflict of interest, nor are there sufficient allegations to support charges of personal animosity on the part of its members. See Hortonville Joint School Dist. Number 1 v. Hortonville Educ. Ass'n, 426 U.S. 482, 491-92, 496, 96 S. Ct. 2308, 49 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1976) (basing, in part, its holding that school board dismissing striking teachers did not violate Due Process Clause on fact that these indicia of bias were lacking). In short, they argue that Professor Tonkovich's complaint contains only conclusory allegations of bias, without alleging factual support. We agree. We simply do not think that Professor Tonkovich has sufficiently alleged personal bias requiring disqualification of the Hearing Committee members under the Due Process Clause. As to the Regents, Professor Tonkovich similarly levels accusations of bias against them. He argues that the Regents' bias violated his procedural due process rights. In support of this argument, he states that the Regents made erroneous and prejudicial decisions and that they deferred to the findings of the Hearing Committee. As with the Hearing Committee, these conclusory assertions are insufficient to allege bias constituting a violation of Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights. Professor Tonkovich next takes issue with what he claims is the Hearing Committee's failure to order discovery. He claims that this led to a denial of his right to cross-examine the witnesses against him. In particular, he argues that he never was able to discover a tape-recording of an alleged interview between the Law Student and University administrators. This, he argues, amounted to a denial of his right to cross-examine the Law Student. Furthermore, Professor Tonkovich argues that he was unable to discover all of the statements that various complainants had submitted during the investigation. As he points out, the Hearing Committee specifically requested, through certified return-receipt mailings, that the complainants produce their statements and return to testify. However, two of the complainants neither produced their statements nor returned to testify. Thus, he argues, he was denied the right to cross-examine these two complainants. Professor Tonkovich also complains that all of the complainants, including the Law Student, refused to allow Professor Tonkovich's attorney to interview them prior to the hearing. First of all, we note that the Hearing Committee ultimately did order discovery prior to Professor Tonkovich's administrative hearing. The fact that Professor Tonkovich was unable to discover every piece of evidence is of no consequence as a matter of procedural due process. The Due Process Clause does not guarantee that parties to an adversarial proceeding may discover every piece of evidence they desire. Indeed, civil litigants in federal court do not have a claim for a violation of their Fourteenth Amendment rights every time a federal district judge or a federal magistrate rules against them in a discovery dispute. Furthermore, Professor Tonkovich has not adequately alleged that he was denied the right to cross-examine adverse witnesses. As we have discussed, he had notice of the charges, and of his accusers, well before the hearing. He was able to cross-examine each of them, albeit not in exactly the way he would have liked. On these facts, we cannot say that the cross-examinations violated Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights simply because he did not have access to several of the witnesses' prior statements. As his complaint admits, the University did provide him with summaries of the complainants' statements. Importantly, Professor Tonkovich has also cited no clearly established legal authority for the proposition that the Due Process Clause requires that he be allowed to interview adverse witnesses prior to a hearing. Professor Tonkovich next argues that the Hearing Committee members violated his procedural due process rights by failing to compel the return of various witnesses who had previously testified. The Hearing Committee members argue that they did not have the authority to compel the attendance of witnesses. They did, however, attempt to assist Professor Tonkovich with the re-appearance of witnesses by sending certified return-receipt mail, as Professor Tonkovich himself acknowledges in his complaint. Professor Tonkovich has cited no law, clearly established or otherwise, which states that an administrative tribunal runs afoul of the Due Process Clause for its failure to compel the attendance of witnesses when it lacks subpoena power. See Workman, 32 F.3d  at 480 (stating that, under the facts of that case, "" [t]he lack of subpoena power available to the plaintiff or the unavailability of some witnesses does not ... create unconstitutional process.""). Even if the Hearing Committee did have subpoena power, a reasonable person in the place of a Hearing Committee member would not know that he or she was violating someone's procedural due process rights for failing to compel the appearance of witnesses under these circumstances. Professor Tonkovich next argues that the Hearing Committee should have mentioned in its findings various pieces of evidence favorable to his side of the case. For example, Professor Tonkovich takes issue with the Hearing Committee's failure to mention the discrepancy between what the Law Student told the judge who employed her and what she told Dean Jerry. Professor Tonkovich claims that the Committee's failure to mention such evidence violated his procedural due process rights. We disagree. The Hearing Committee handed down extensive findings and conclusions after a hearing spanning approximately nine months. Under the circumstances, the fact that the Committee did not mention every possible fact in its resolution of the case does not implicate due process. Professor Tonkovich also claims that the Hearing Committee itself admitted that the proceedings against him were unfair because it recommended additional procedures for future disciplinary proceedings. Taking into consideration the procedures afforded Professor Tonkovich, the fact that the Hearing Committee members made recommendations concerning future disciplinary proceedings does not convince us that they violated his procedural due process rights. In sum, the Regents and the Hearing Committee members argue that under Loudermill, Professor Tonkovich was entitled only to notice of the charges, an explanation of the evidence against him, and an opportunity to respond. They argue that the allegations in Professor Tonkovich's own complaint establish that he received this and much more. We agree. Therefore, the district court erred in denying the motion to dismiss Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process claim against the Regents and the Hearing Committee members on the basis of qualified immunity. Professor McKenzie (Case No. 96-3405) The only allegations against Professor McKenzie in particular were that she signed the Letter, she refused to testify, and she dated a student. None of these allegations, she argues, are sufficient to establish that she violated a constitutional right. We agree. As we shall discuss at length below, when the Law School faculty members signed the Letter, they did not thereby violate Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights. As to the remaining allegations against Professor McKenzie-that she refused to testify on Professor Tonkovich's behalf and that she dated a student-we fail to see how these might form the basis of a procedural due process claim. Professor McKenzie neither subjected Professor Tonkovich, nor caused Professor Tonkovich to be subjected, to the deprivation of his procedural due process rights. Thus, the district court erred in denying her motion to dismiss the procedural due process claim on qualified immunity grounds. 4. Appeal of the University General Counsel (Case No. 96-3406) The specific allegations against General Counsel Thomas are that she gave an opinion as to the applicability of the University's statute of limitations, and she attended two meetings to discuss Professor Tonkovich's case. Essentially, he seems to be complaining that she did her job. Ms. Thomas argues that neither of these actions can be said to have violated Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights. We agree. The allegations against Associate General Counsel Marino, who prosecuted the case on behalf of the University, are that she denied the existence of the complainants' statements and that she violated two of the Hearing Committee's evidentiary rulings. Specifically, she asked a witness about her sexual involvement with law professors, and she read a portion of the Law Student's testimony to another witness who was scheduled to testify. Associate General Counsel Marino argues that even if some of these actions constituted infractions of a University policy or rule, this is not enough to rise to the level of a deprivation of a federal constitutional right. We note that a university's failure to follow its established guidelines in overseeing a grievance ""does not in and of itself implicate constitutional due process concerns."" Purisch v. Tennessee Technological University, 76 F.3d 1414, 1423 (6th Cir. 1996); cf. Jones v. City and County of Denver, 854 F.2d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir. 1988) (a violation of state law, by itself, does not rise to the level of a federal constitutional deprivation, and, thus, is not cognizable under § 1983). The federal courts, and not the University of Kansas, are responsible for establishing the contours of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Thus, even taking Professor Tonkovich's allegations against Ms. Marino as true, as we must, we do not think they are sufficient to establish the violation of his procedural due process rights. While Ms. Marino's failure to adhere to certain evidentiary rules was perhaps not a model of prosecutorial conduct, nothing that she did changes the fact that Professor Tonkovich received notice, an opportunity to be heard by an impartial tribunal, and various post-termination remedies. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court erred in denying Ms. Thomas's and Ms. Marino's motion to dismiss the procedural due process claim on qualified immunity grounds. 5. Appeal of Law School Faculty Members (Case No. 96-3407) The Law School faculty members argue that they were not even in a position from which they could afford or deny procedural protections to Professor Tonkovich. Thus, they argue, they cannot be said to have violated his due process rights. We disagree with the notion that a faculty member, by virtue of his or her position within a university, may never effect a procedural due process violation. However, in this case, nothing the Law School faculty members did caused a deprivation of Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights. The specific allegations against the Law School faculty members are as follows: (1) they signed the Letter soliciting additional complaints; (2) they met with University administrators to discuss the case; (3) they accompanied students who submitted complaints to administrators; (4) two of them stated they heard that the Law Student's complaint contained an allegation of rape; (5) some of them refused to disclose, and one of them intentionally destroyed, complainant statements; and (6) they testified as witnesses at Professor Tonkovich's hearing. The faculty members argue that Professor Tonkovich has failed to point to any clearly established law that stands for the proposition that any of these actions might form the basis of a procedural due process claim. We shall first address the Law School faculty members' role in authoring, signing, and distributing the Letter, which Professor Tonkovich continually refers to as the ""secret"" solicitation process. See, e.g., Aple's Brief at 7, 31, 43. Professor Tonkovich cites no clearly established Tenth Circuit or Supreme Court precedent standing for the proposition that when a university is investigating a complaint of sexual misconduct against a professor, the university must disclose, during the investigatory process, every complaint it solicits and the means it uses to solicit those complaints. In fact, there is precedent in this circuit that arguably supports a contrary proposition. In Derstein v. Kansas, 915 F.2d 1410 (10th Cir. 1990), the plaintiff, a tenured court employee who could be terminated only for just cause, was fired after an investigation revealed that he had sexually harassed various fellow employees. The plaintiff was told neither that an investigation was underway nor that complaints against him were being solicited. A court personnel officer conducted the investigation by tape-recording interviews with various court employees and then transcribing the tapes. After the investigation was complete the plaintiff was told that he would have ten days to resign or be terminated. Id. at 1412. He was also advised that he could appeal the decision and that a hearing would be afforded at that time. At the end of the ten-day period, the plaintiff received a termination letter, which specified the nature of the charges against him and his right to appeal. The plaintiff filed an administrative appeal, which was denied as frivolous. At no time during the administrative proceedings did the employer provide the plaintiff with transcripts of the tape-recorded interviews. Id. The plaintiff then filed a § 1983 action. After a bench trial, the district court held that the pretermination proceedings deprived the plaintiff of a property interest without due process of law. Id. at 1411. We reversed, holding that the pretermination procedures comported with Loudermill 's requirements. Id. at 1413. We stated that the fact that the plaintiff ""may not have known in advance about [the personnel officer's] internal investigation [and that he] did not receive more facts or a copy of the transcript at the pretermination hearing is not significant."" Id. at 1413. Likewise, in the case at bar, the fact that University administrators conducted an investigation without Professor Tonkovich's knowledge does not implicate procedural due process because he ultimately received notice of the charges and a meaningful opportunity to respond in the hearing that took place over a period of nine months. We noted that the plaintiff in Derstein never contested the factual basis for the sexual harassment charges, i.e., he did not deny that the conduct occurred. Under those circumstances, we held that the appeal to an appeals board constituted a sufficient post-termination procedure, even though the appeals board did not grant the plaintiff a full evidentiary hearing. We found that this post-termination proceeding, in combination with the pretermination procedures, afforded the plaintiff all of the process he was due. In Professor Tonkovich's case, he obviously did contest the factual basis for the charges against him; however, he also received a full-blown evidentiary hearing. The fact that University officials and faculty members did not keep Professor Tonkovich apprised every step along the way of the investigation does not amount to a violation of his procedural due process rights. Professor Tonkovich next complains that when the Law School faculty members met with University administrators to discuss his case, and when they accompanied the complainants to meet with administrators, they violated his procedural due process rights. We fail to see how either of these actions might form the basis of a procedural due process claim in the absence of allegations that these actions interfered with Professor Tonkovich's receiving notice of the charges or with his ability to respond to those charges. Professor Tonkovich has not cited any law, clearly established or otherwise, that would support the proposition that in taking part in the investigation as the Law School faculty members here did, their actions ran afoul of the Due Process Clause. Next, Professor Tonkovich argues that two of the Law School faculty members violated his procedural due process rights when they repeated information they had heard, namely, that the allegations against Professor Tonkovich included an allegation of rape. Assuming, as we must, that the allegation is false, it still does not implicate procedural due process.  While the statements may be actionable under state tort law, they do not rise to the level of depriving Professor Tonkovich of federal procedural due process rights. There is no allegation that the statements made by the professors had anything to do with whether Professor Tonkovich received notice of the charges against him or had a meaningful opportunity to respond, which is what procedural due process requires. Finally, Professor Tonkovich takes issue with the Law School faculty members' role in testifying at his hearing and in discarding or denying the existence of the written complainant statements. Once again, he cites no clearly established law that stands for the proposition that taking such actions implicates procedural due process. As we have discussed, Professor Tonkovich received summaries of the statements, and he was able to cross-examine the complainants; therefore, the fact that several professors were not forthcoming with written statements does not amount to a violation of Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights. Although such conduct on the part of the professors is not to be lauded, it simply does not rise to a level sufficient to implicate procedural due process concerns. Furthermore, we fail to see how the professors' acts in testifying at Professor Tonkovich's hearing--and thereby being subjected to cross-examination--violated his procedural due process rights. For all of these reasons, the district court should have granted the Law School faculty members' motion to dismiss the procedural due process claim on qualified immunity grounds. 6. Appeal of the Chancellor's Office (Case No. 96-3408) The Chancellor's office staff members argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process claim because Professor Tonkovich received all of the process he was due. Furthermore, they argue that Professor Tonkovich failed to show that any of their actions constituted violations of a clearly established right. The specific allegations against staff members of the Chancellor's office are as follows: (1) they extended the investigation after having set a deadline for filing complaints against Professor Tonkovich; (2) Vice Chancellor Brinkman and Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel at first recommended a one-year paid suspension, but as the investigation progressed, they increased the proposed sanction to dismissal; (3) Associate Vice Chancellor Shulenberger interviewed the complainants; (4) Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel denied that the complainants had submitted written statements; (5) during settlement negotiations, Vice Chancellor Brinkman and Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel recommended that Professor Tonkovich resign quietly, and they stated that there were no terms acceptable to the University for Professor Tonkovich to continue as a faculty member; and (6) Chancellor Budig prosecuted charges even after several students stated that the charges were groundless. Professor Tonkovich's argument that extending the investigation and increasing the proposed sanction violated his procedural due process rights must fail. Neither the length of the investigation nor the decision to increase the proposed sanction deprived Professor Tonkovich of his rights to notice and an opportunity to respond. It is not as if the sanction he faced was changed during the course of or after his hearing. Well before his hearing began, he understood that he faced dismissal from the Law School faculty. Additionally, the fact that Professor Tonkovich initially responded in writing to the Law Student's charges, when he faced only suspension, is not significant because that was not his only opportunity to respond. Ultimately, after the investigation was complete, he was informed of all of the charges against him and given ample opportunity to respond to all of them. Professor Tonkovich next argues that Associate Vice Chancellor Shulenberger violated his procedural due process rights when he interviewed the complainants. Professor Tonkovich wholly fails to allege how these interviews deprived him of his rights to notice or an opportunity to respond. Furthermore, he cites no clearly established law standing for the proposition that during the course of an investigation of a university professor, a university administrator violates the professor's procedural due process rights by interviewing students with complaints. Next Professor Tonkovich complains of Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel's denial of the existence of written complainant statements. We have already discussed the failure to reveal the complainants' statements in the context of the Hearing Committee, Ms. Marino, and the Law School faculty members. For similar reasons, the fact that Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel denied that the complainants had submitted written statements does not implicate Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights. Although such conduct on the part of any university employee is not to be commended, it does not rise to the level of a constitutional violation. As previously discussed, the University provided summaries of the statements prior to his hearing, and Professor Tonkovich had the opportunity to cross-examine each of the complainants. Professor Tonkovich next argues that Vice Chancellor Brinkman and Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel violated his procedural due process rights when they took part in settlement negotiations. Specifically he points to their actions in recommending that he resign quietly and in stating that there were no terms acceptable to the University for Professor Tonkovich to continue as a faculty member. Professor Tonkovich fails to allege, however, how these actions caused the deprivation of his procedural due process rights. He does not allege, for example, that in pressuring him to resign quietly or in stating that there were no acceptable terms to the University, Vice Chancellor Brinkman and Executive Vice Chancellor Shankel somehow prevented him from receiving notice of the charges against him or an opportunity to respond. Finally, Professor Tonkovich argues that Chancellor Budig violated his procedural due process rights by including in the formal complaint allegations that several law students thought were groundless. We fail to see how this implicates Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights in the absence of an allegation that he was not given notice of these charges or an opportunity to respond to them. It is hardly the role of a law student to decide which allegations to include in a charging document against a faculty member. Professor Tonkovich was free to call these students as witnesses in his defense, and his complaint indicates that these students did submit affidavits stating their positions. For all of these reasons, the district court erred in denying the motion to dismiss the procedural due process claim against the staff members of the Chancellor's office on qualified immunity grounds. After considering the arguments of the parties, we turn our attention briefly to the district court's disposition of the qualified immunity issue as it relates to Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process claim. The district court concluded that Professor Tonkovich's hearing was a combined pre and post-termination hearing. Aplts' App. vol. IV, doc. 18 at 1345-46. However, Professor Tonkovich was not dismissed until after the hearing was complete and the Hearing Committee handed down its findings and conclusions. During the course of his hearing, although he was on teaching leave, his employment with the University had not been terminated. Thus, we think the district court was technically incorrect on this point. The evidentiary hearing was, in actuality, a pretermination hearing that afforded Professor Tonkovich more process than he was due prior to being terminated. In addition, the district court failed to consider that Professor Tonkovich had the opportunity to appeal to the Board of Regents and then, finally, to file an action for judicial review in state district court. A state court proceeding for judicial review of the University's action would have afforded Professor Tonkovich the opportunity to present evidence as to the alleged ""unlawfulness of [the] procedure or of [the] decision-making process."" See Kan. Stat. Ann. § 77-619(a) (2). Furthermore, on judicial review, the state district court would have had the power to order the University to take a specific action, enjoin the University from enforcing an action, or render appropriate declaratory relief. See id. at § 77-622(b). Although, as we have stated, exhaustion is not a prerequisite to bringing a § 1983 claim, the fact that Professor Tonkovich did have the opportunity for an additional post-termination hearing, regardless of whether he exercised this right, is germane to our inquiry into what process the state afforded him. The district court further concluded that the individual defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity in part because Professor Tonkovich received inadequate notice of the charges against him due to the fact that the University increased the stakes as the investigation progressed. We think this conclusion is incorrect for at least two reasons. First of all, the fact remains that approximately four months before the hearing, the University filed a written complaint against Professor Tonkovich. Thus, well in advance, the Chancellor informed Professor Tonkovich in writing as to the charges and the penalty he faced. Second, the district court failed to consider which of the individual defendants was responsible for giving Professor Tonkovich notice of the charges. Surely, for example, the Law School faculty members cannot be said to have violated Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process rights by failing to give him notice of the charges, because they had no duty to give him notice; moreover, none of their actions deprived him of notice. As we have stated, under Loudermill, before he was terminated, Professor Tonkovich was entitled to notice, an explanation of the charges against him, and an opportunity to respond. Professor Tonkovich's own complaint reflects that, prior to his termination, he received these protections and much more. A full-blown evidentiary hearing clearly meets the dictates of Loudermill. Taking into consideration Professor Tonkovich's pretermination hearing, in combination with the various post-termination proceedings afforded by the state, we conclude that Professor Tonkovich was afforded all of the process that he was due, and perhaps more than what Loudermill requires. Because we have found that Professor Tonkovich received all of the process that he was due, we must reject his claim for deprivation of a liberty interest, as well. In order to demonstrate the infringement of a liberty interest in one's good name, one must show that: (1) the defendant made a statement impugning his or her good name, reputation, honor, or integrity; (2) the statement was false; (3) the defendant made the statement in the course of termination proceedings or the statement foreclosed future employment opportunities; and (4) the statement was published. Workman, 32 F.3d  at 481 (internal citations omitted). In such a case, the Due Process Clause requires an adequate name-clearing hearing. Id. at 480. We acknowledge that Professor Tonkovich did, indeed, have a liberty interest in his reputation, deserving of due process protection. However, even if the University infringed that interest, when, for example, two of the faculty members stated that they heard that the Law Student accused Professor Tonkovich of rape, we conclude that the University provided him with an adequate name-clearing hearing. Thus, there is perhaps a tort claim, but there is no constitutional violation.  After carefully considering Professor Tonkovich's allegations, the defendants' arguments, and the relevant law, we hold that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's procedural due process claim. We do not necessarily condone each of the procedures that the University followed in the course of Professor Tonkovich's disciplinary proceedings. Nevertheless, as we have discussed, every alleged procedural error does not necessarily implicate due process. Although Professor Tonkovich may or may not have valid claims based on violations of state law, he has failed to meet his burden on qualified immunity as it relates to his federal procedural due process claim. We turn now to a discussion of Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim. B. Are the Defendants Entitled to Qualified Immunity on Professor Tonkovich's Substantive Due Process Claim? At the outset, we must address the district court's supposed failure to consider the defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim. The district court stated that after an extensive review of the record, it could not ""locate the individual defendants' argument that they are entitled to qualified immunity on plaintiff's substantive due process claim."" Aplts' App. vol. IV, doc. 18 at 1350. Therefore, the court stated that it was declining to address the issue. Id. Although all of the defendants filed motions to dismiss Professor Tonkovich's due process claim based on qualified immunity, they did not separately address substantive due process. However, they all argued, in more or less general terms, that they are entitled to qualified immunity because Professor Tonkovich failed to allege specific facts showing that they had violated any clearly established constitutional right of which a reasonable person would have known. See, e.g., Aplts' App. vol. I, doc. 3 at 172 (plaintiff's failure to allege that Hearing Committee members violated clearly established right entitles them to qualified immunity); id., doc. 4 at 216-17 (plaintiff's failure to identify clearly established right entitles Board of Regents to qualified immunity); id., doc. 5 at 248 (doctrine of qualified immunity bars suit against Law School faculty members because their conduct had no effect on plaintiff's constitutional rights); id. vol. II, doc. 7 at 679 (Dean Jerry entitled to qualified immunity because his actions did not violate clearly established constitutional rights); see also id. vol. III, doc. 9 at 996 (plaintiff's failure to allege that Chancellor's office staff members violated clearly established due process rights entitled them to qualified immunity). Our review of count one of Professor Tonkovich's first amended complaint indicates that Professor Tonkovich himself did not delineate his due process claim as containing both a procedural and a substantive component. On the contrary, count one is entitled ""42 U.S.C. Section 1983 (Fourteenth Amendment Due Process)."" Id. vol. I, doc. 1 at 79. Nowhere in his complaint does Professor Tonkovich argue that the defendants violated his substantive due process rights. He simply refers to ""due process,"" which, under the circumstances, the defendants could reasonably interpret in various ways. Professor Tonkovich has the burden to identify the rights that he alleges the defendants violated. See Walter, 33 F.3d  at 1242. Thus, the defendants should not be required to guess whether Professor Tonkovich pled a substantive due process claim, a procedural due process claim, or both. At this stage of the litigation, Professor Tonkovich argues that his substantive due process claim is based on the allegation that he did not have fair warning of prohibited conduct and is further based ""on the defendants' other arbitrary and wrongful actions."" Aple's Brief at 36. However, Professor Tonkovich did not articulate his ""no fair warning"" argument before the district court in his response to the defendants' motions to dismiss. Instead, he argued that his substantive due process claim was based on the fact that the defendants had deprived him of liberty and property. Aplts' App. vol. III, doc. 10 at 1102-03. Such an argument applies equally in the procedural due process arena as it does in the substantive, for there can be no violation of one's procedural due process rights without a deprivation of life, liberty, or property. See U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. Moreover, in the portion of his response addressing substantive due process, Professor Tonkovich referred to the defendants denying him an impartial tribunal, arguably a procedural due process topic, rather than a substantive one. Aplts' App. vol. III, doc. 10 at 1103. Our point here is that Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim lacked crisp contours during the district court proceedings. And even now, as mentioned above, Professor Tonkovich argues that his substantive due process claim is based, in part, on a host of allegedly arbitrary and wrongful actions of the defendants, some of which implicate procedural due process concerns. Because of the overlap inherent in the way Professor Tonkovich pled his due process claim, we think that the district court read the defendants' motions to dismiss too narrowly. In other words, we think that the defendants' motions to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity were sufficient to put the district court on notice that they were asserting the affirmative defense of qualified immunity with respect to Professor Tonkovich's entire § 1983 due process claim. Furthermore, because the substantive due process claim is based, in part, on allegedly arbitrary actions that may be fairly characterized as implicating procedural due process rights, we think the district court's treatment of the due process claim with respect to qualified immunity is of sufficient breadth to allow us to review the issue of qualified immunity as it relates specifically to substantive due process. We turn now to that portion of our task. Because Professor Tonkovich was a tenured professor, the law in this Circuit is that he possessed ""a property interest deserving of ... substantive protections of the Fourteenth Amendment."" Brenna, 589 F.2d  at 476. Substantive due process requires that the termination of a tenured professor's property interest not be ""arbitrary, capricious, or without a rational basis."" Id. at 477. The Supreme Court has ""emphasized time and again that [t]he touchstone of due process is protection of the individual against arbitrary action of government...."" Lewis, at ----, 118 S. Ct.  at 1716 (quotation omitted). In Uhlrig v. Harder, 64 F.3d 567 (10th Cir. 1995), we stated that ""the standard for judging a substantive due process claim is whether the challenged government action would 'shock the conscience of federal judges.' "" Id. at 573 (quoting Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115, 126, 112 S. Ct. 1061, 117 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1992)) (quotation omitted). To satisfy this standard, ""a plaintiff must do more than show that the government actor intentionally or recklessly caused injury to the plaintiff by abusing or misusing government power."" Uhlrig, 64 F.3d  at 574. Instead, a plaintiff ""must demonstrate a degree of outrageousness and a magnitude of potential or actual harm that is truly conscience shocking."" Id. We acknowledged that "" [t]he level of conduct required to satisfy this additional requirement cannot precisely be defined, but must necessarily evolve over time from judgments as to the constitutionality of specific government conduct."" Id. Recently, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the ""shocks the conscience"" test in Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 118 S. Ct. 1708, 140 L. Ed. 2d 1043, which involved a substantive due process claim brought under § 1983 against a municipality after a high-speed police chase killed a sixteen-year-old boy. The Court noted that "" [w]hile due process protection in the substantive sense limits what the government may do in both its legislative and its executive capacities, criteria to identify what is fatally arbitrary differ depending on whether it is legislation or a specific act of a governmental officer that is at issue."" Id. at ----, 118 S. Ct.  at 1716 (citations omitted). The Court went on to state that ""for half a century now we have spoken of the cognizable level of executive abuse of power as that which shocks the conscience."" Id. at ----, 118 S. Ct.  at 1717. Accordingly, when a plaintiff brings a substantive due process challenge to executive action, ""the threshold question is whether the behavior of the governmental officer is so egregious, so outrageous, that it may fairly be said to shock the contemporary conscience."" Id. at ---- n. 8, 118 S. Ct.  at 1717 n. 8. Professor Tonkovich argues that the ""shocks the conscience"" standard does not apply to this case because the defendants' conduct was intentional. He argues that the defendants' actions should be measured instead against a generic standard of arbitrariness. However, in the alternative, he argues that the defendants' conduct was, indeed, shocking to the conscience. There is some indication that the ""shocks the conscience"" standard and the ""arbitrariness"" standard are used interchangeably. See, e.g. Collins, 503 U.S.  at 128, 112 S. Ct. 1061 (stating that the Court is not persuaded that the defendants' actions ""can properly be characterized as arbitrary, or conscience shocking, in a constitutional sense""). Justice Scalia's reading of the majority opinion in Lewis is that the shocks-the-conscience test ""is the measure of arbitrariness when what is at issue is executive rather than legislative action."" Lewis, 523 U.S. at ----, 118 S. Ct.  at 1724 (Scalia, J., concurring) (emphasis in original). In any event, we express no opinion on whether the ""shocks the conscience"" standard applies to this case because regardless of whether we use that standard or we simply inquire whether the defendants' actions were arbitrary or lacking a rational basis, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim. As we shall discuss in greater detail below, the defendants' actions were not arbitrary, did not lack a rational basis, and were not shocking to the conscience. As we have discussed, Professor Tonkovich claims that the defendants violated his substantive due process rights by their failure to warn him of prohibited conduct and by their other arbitrary and wrongful actions. At this juncture, we shall discuss each defendant's (or defendant group's) arguments with respect to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim. Professor Tonkovich argues that Dean Jerry violated his substantive due process rights because the memorandum he issued to faculty falsely asserted that student/faculty sex was unethical under the Faculty Code. Furthermore, Professor Tonkovich argues, Dean Jerry violated his substantive due process rights by proposing a rule, with retroactive application, prohibiting sexual relations between professors and students enrolled in their courses. Since the Law School faculty did not approve Dean Jerry's proposed rule, the argument goes, Professor Tonkovich was arbitrarily charged with violating a nonexistent rule. In response, Dean Jerry argues that Professor Tonkovich did indeed have fair warning that his conduct was prohibited because at the time he allegedly engaged in a sexual act with one of his students after discussing law school grades with her, it was clearly unethical, under existing University policy, for a professor to exploit a student for his own private advantage. We acknowledge that the allegations against Professor Tonkovich required Dean Jerry and other University officials to confront a difficult question: when does sexual contact between participants in an unequal power relationship become exploitative? However, the fact that reasonable minds might not agree with the way in which the majority of the Hearing Committee, the Chancellor, and the Regents resolved that question is insufficient to support a substantive due process claim. In this regard, we note that the Seventh Circuit has rejected a claim similar to Professor Tonkovich's claim that he did not have fair warning that his conduct was prohibited. In Korf v. Ball State Univ., 726 F.2d 1222 (7th Cir. 1984), a tenured professor who allegedly sexually harassed various students filed a § 1983 suit after he was discharged from the faculty. He alleged that his substantive due process rights were violated because he did not have adequate notice that consensual sexual relations between faculty members and students were prohibited. Id. at 1226. The court noted that, after an investigation and a hearing, a committee found that the plaintiff had engaged in unethical behavior by exploiting students for his private advantage. Thus, consensual sexual relations were not at issue. The court stated that "" [c]ommon sense, reason and good judgment should have made [the plaintiff] cognizant of the fact that his conduct could and would be cause for termination."" Id. at 1227. Likewise, in the case at bar, if common sense, reason, and good judgment were not adequate to notify Professor Tonkovich, certainly the Faculty Code's prohibition against exploiting students concretely notified him that he could be terminated for having sex with one of his students after discussing her grades. Next, Professor Tonkovich argues that Dean Jerry violated his substantive due process rights by initially withholding the name of Professor Tonkovich's accuser and the nature of the accusation. However, Professor Tonkovich has cited no law, and certainly no clearly established law, supporting his argument that he had a substantive due process right to know the name of his accuser on the day she lodged her complaint. Furthermore, as we have discussed, Professor Tonkovich knew the name of his accuser and the nature of her allegation well before he had the opportunity to cross-examine her. Finally, Professor Tonkovich argues that Dean Jerry violated his substantive due process rights by giving him an unearned negative annual evaluation and the lowest merit salary increase on the entire law school faculty. In light of the fact that Professor Tonkovich was embroiled in a scandal involving sexual misconduct with one of his students, we cannot say that Dean Jerry's action in this respect was completely arbitrary or irrational. Professor Tonkovich certainly has not cited any clearly established law that would lead us to such a conclusion. For these reasons, the district court erred in denying Dean Jerry's motion to dismiss the substantive due process claim on qualified immunity grounds. 2. Appeal of Regents (Case No. 96-3403) and Hearing Committee (Case No. 96-3404) Professor Tonkovich argues that the Regents and the Hearing Committee members violated his substantive due process rights by making erroneous findings that he engaged in unethical conduct. Furthermore, he argues, they violated his substantive due process rights by voting for his dismissal, a sanction that he claims lacks a rational basis. The Regents and the Hearing Committee members argue that the fact that they did not agree with Professor Tonkovich on every issue and did not ultimately find in his favor cannot form the basis of a substantive due process claim against them. They argue that even assuming, for purposes of argument, their decisions in finding that he committed the charged conduct and voting for his dismissal were wrong, these actions do not rise to the level of a substantive due process violation. We agree. Indeed, "" [t]he Due Process Clause is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions."" Collins, 503 U.S.  at 129, 112 S. Ct. 1061 (quotation omitted). For these reasons, the district court erred in denying the Regents' and the Hearing Committee members' motions to dismiss the substantive due process claim on qualified immunity grounds. Professor McKenzie (Case No. 96-3405) Professor McKenzie is entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim for the same reasons that she is entitled to qualified immunity on his procedural due process claim. That is, in merely signing the Letter, refusing to testify, and dating a student, Professor McKenzie neither subjected Professor Tonkovich, nor caused Professor Tonkovich to be subjected, to a deprivation of his substantive due process rights. Furthermore, Professor Tonkovich has cited no clearly established law standing for the proposition that taking any of these actions violates one's substantive due process rights. 4. Appeal of the University General Counsel (Case No. 96-3406) We have already discussed the specific allegations against Ms. Thomas and Ms. Marino. Professor Tonkovich has failed to cite any clearly established law that would lead us to believe that any of the actions they took or failed to take caused the deprivation of his substantive due process rights. For this reason, Ms. Thomas and Ms. Marino are entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim. 5. Appeal of Law School Faculty Members (Case No. 96-3407) Professors Shapiro, Robinson, Dayton, Schroeder, and Sward argue that they are entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim because the allegations against them do not show a violation of a constitutional right at all, much less a clearly established right. We have already discussed the specific allegations against the Law School faculty members, and we will not repeat them here. We agree that Professor Tonkovich has pointed to no Supreme Court or Tenth Circuit precedent establishing that any of their actions could constitute a violation of one's substantive due process rights. We shall, however, address two specific allegations. Professor Tonkovich claims that two of the Law School faculty members violated his substantive due process rights by stating that the Law Student had accused him of rape. However, "" [a] substantive due process violation must be something more than an ordinary tort to be actionable under § 1983."" Abeyta v. Chama Valley Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 19, 77 F.3d 1253, 1257 (10th Cir. 1996). Professor Tonkovich may have a cause of action against these professors or against the University under state law, but he has failed to meet his burden on qualified immunity as to a federal constitutional claim. As to Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim based on a lack of fair warning of prohibited conduct, the Law School faculty members argue that this claim contains no allegations addressed specifically to them. That is, they argue that Professor Tonkovich did not allege that they had a duty to warn him of what kind of conduct the Faculty Code prohibited. Additionally, they argue, Professor Tonkovich was put on notice that exploiting a student for his own benefit was a violation of the Faculty Code. We agree. For these additional reasons, the Law School faculty members are entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process claim. 6. Appeal of the Chancellor's Office (Case No. 96-3408) Professor Tonkovich argues that the University violated his substantive due process rights by ignoring its six-month statute of limitations for sexual harassment charges. However, as counsel for the Board of Regents pointed out at oral argument, the charges against Professor Tonkovich were not solely based on sexual harassment. Professor Tonkovich was charged with violating an ethical provision of the Faculty Code. Even if a claim of sexual harassment was time-barred, the claim of an ethical violation was not. We cannot say that it was unconstitutionally arbitrary for the University to proceed with the prosecution, even though some of the charges involved sexual misconduct. Furthermore, Professor Tonkovich has failed to cite clearly established law demonstrating that a reasonable University official in the Chancellor's position would have known that going forward with the prosecution would have violated Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process rights. Next Professor Tonkovich claims that the staff members of the Chancellor's office violated his substantive due process rights by attempting to discourage him from exercising his right to a hearing. Specifically, he claims that after he requested a hearing, University administrators warned him that past conduct might be cause for future disciplinary action. In addition, the University increased the possible sanction from a one-year paid teaching suspension to dismissal. He claims that he was fired for asserting his innocence and demanding a hearing. We note that as the investigation progressed, the complaints against Professor Tonkovich mounted. There was nothing unconstitutionally arbitrary about extending the investigation or about changing the proposed disciplinary action. Professor Tonkovich next argues that Chancellor Budig violated his substantive due process rights because the charges against him and the recommended sanction lacked a rational basis. However, after the investigation was completed, the University had its side of the story, and Professor Tonkovich had his side of the story. Even taking Professor Tonkovich's version of the facts as true, as we must, we cannot say that the charges and the penalty he faced were unconstitutionally arbitrary. For these reasons, we conclude that the district court erred in denying the motion to dismiss the substantive due process claim against the staff members of the Chancellor's office on qualified immunity grounds. After carefully considering Professor Tonkovich's allegations and each of the defendants' arguments, we conclude that the district court erred in denying the defendants' motions to dismiss any ""substantive due process"" claim Professor Tonkovich may have asserted. Professor Tonkovich's substantive due process argument on appeal takes up almost nineteen pages in his brief but contains very little legal authority. Pages and pages of facts are no substitute for citations to clearly established law. Nor can they meet Professor Tonkovich's burden on qualified immunity. We hold that each of the individual defendants is entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's § 1983 claim based on a violation of his substantive due process rights. C. Are the Defendants Entitled to Qualified Immunity on Professor Tonkovich's Equal Protection Claim? According to the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, ""No State shall ... deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws."" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1. This Clause ""embodies a general rule that States must treat like cases alike but may treat unlike cases accordingly."" Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, ----, 117 S. Ct. 2293, 2297, 138 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1997). Unless a legislative classification or distinction burdens a fundamental right or targets a suspect class, courts will uphold it if it is rationally related to a legitimate end. Id. Professor Tonkovich does not allege that a fundamental right is at stake, nor does he allege that he is a member of a suspect class. Thus, in order to prevail on his equal protection claim, he must show that the University treated him differently than others ""similarly situated ... and that this different treatment lacked a rational basis."" Landmark Land Co. of Oklahoma v. Buchanan, 874 F.2d 717, 722 (10th Cir. 1989); see also City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 439-40, 105 S. Ct. 3249, 87 L. Ed. 2d 313 (1985). Professor Tonkovich alleges that the defendants violated his equal protection rights because the University has not penalized other professors, much less dismissed them, for dating their students. He points out that not only did other law professors openly date students but that the Law School actually promoted social activities between professors and students. The district court concluded that "" [a]llegations that these defendants disciplined plaintiff for a faculty-student relationship, without similar discipline for other professors who had relationships with students, establish a possible violation of plaintiff's right to equal protection."" Aplts' App. vol. IV, doc. 18 at 1356. There are at least two crucial problems with the district court's conclusion. First, as many defendants have pointed out, Professor Tonkovich has failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that he is similarly situated to law professors who dated students. Professor Tonkovich was not charged with dating a student. He was charged with exploiting a student for his own private advantage by engaging one of his students in a discussion of grades and then having sexual relations with her. Although we must accept as true Professor Tonkovich's claim that he did not engage in the charged behavior, see Aplts' App. vol. I, doc. 1 at 60, we must also accept as true the fact that this is part of what the University prosecuted him for and found him guilty of, see id. at 57-58. In any event, Professor Tonkovich does not allege that he was dating the Law Student, or any of his other students. Second, the district court's conclusion is infirm because it lumps all of ""these defendants"" together despite the fact that each of the defendants had different powers and duties and took different actions with respect to Professor Tonkovich. Although the district court acknowledged that it must identify on the record defendants' conduct that violated clearly established law, see Aplts' App. vol. IV, doc. 18 at 1342, it wholly failed to identify specific actions taken by particular defendants that could form the basis of an equal protection claim. For example, the district court did not point to any particular action taken by a Law School faculty member that can be said to have caused a deprivation of Professor Tonkovich's equal protection rights. In this way, the district court erred in failing to grant the Law School faculty members qualified immunity. It is not necessary for us, however, to consider the specific allegations against each defendant because at the heart of any equal protection claim must be an allegation of being treated differently than those similarly situated. Professor Tonkovich would have had to allege that other professors who had sex with a student, in a manner that exploited the student, were not treated the way he was treated by University officials. Therefore, we conclude that the district court erred when it ruled that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's equal protection claim. We hold that each of the individual defendants is entitled to qualified immunity as to Professor Tonkovich's § 1983 claim based on a violation of his right to equal protection of the laws. Professor Tonkovich argues that the reasonable inference to be drawn from all of the allegations in his complaint is that the defendants engaged in concerted action with the common goal of terminating his employment with the University. Professor Tonkovich claims that the reason the University handled his case the way it did and the reason he was ultimately dismissed is because of his outspoken political conservatism and because he supported an unpopular candidate during a divisive dean search at the Law School.  By raising the specter of a conspiracy, he attempts to avoid a grant of qualified immunity to the individual defendants. It is true that on a motion to dismiss, we must draw all reasonable inferences in Professor Tonkovich's favor. Swanson, 750 F.2d  at 813. However, we do not think that Professor Tonkovich has properly pled a claim that the individual defendants acted in concert to deprive him of his constitutional rights. Put differently, we do not think that such an inference is reasonable. At oral argument, counsel for the Law School faculty members and counsel for Ms. Thomas and Ms. Marino argued that Professor Tonkovich did not allege a civil rights conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1985 in his complaint. Counsel for Professor Tonkovich conceded that Professor Tonkovich did not plead a § 1985 claim. However, he claims that he has met his burden of showing that the defendants violated clearly established rights under § 1983. For example, he argues, the fact that some of the Law School faculty members met with certain administrators during the investigatory process and then signed the Letter soliciting complaints from students is enough to show that the faculty members were acting in concert with the administrators to deprive him of his constitutional rights. Allegations of conspiracy may, indeed, form the basis of a § 1983 claim. Hunt v. Bennett, 17 F.3d 1263, 1266 (10th Cir. 1994). However, a plaintiff must allege specific facts showing an agreement and concerted action amongst the defendants. Id. ""Conclusory allegations of conspiracy are insufficient to state a valid § 1983 claim."" Id. (quotation omitted). Professor Tonkovich presents us with nothing more than conclusory allegations. We do not think it is reasonable to infer, for example, that because certain Law School faculty members met with certain administrators during the investigation, they were conspiring with one another and with the Hearing Committee who ultimately found against Professor Tonkovich. Furthermore, there is no indication that the Hearing Committee members or the Regents were even aware of the divisive dean search or of the candidate whom Professor Tonkovich supported. Professor Tonkovich has simply failed to carry his burden of alleging the facts necessary to support his claim of conspiracy on qualified immunity. Ironically, Professor Tonkovich has said both too much and too little. His complaint certainly does not follow the dictates of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a) (""A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief ... shall contain ... a short and plain statement of the claim....)."" He pled facts extensively and repetitively in a 101-page complaint. However, as we have noted, facts by the truckload are simply not enough to meet a plaintiff's burden on qualified immunity. At the same time, we are certainly less than sanguine about some of the alleged actions taken by various University officials. In addition, the allegations of various violations of University policy cause us some discomfort. We do not know if we would have reached the same result that the Hearing Committee reached, by a close 3-2 vote. However, as we stated earlier, "" [t]he Due Process Clause is not a guarantee against incorrect or ill-advised personnel decisions."" Collins, 503 U.S.  at 129, 112 S. Ct. 1061 (quotation omitted). As noted legal scholar Alexander Bickel observed, "" [T]he highest morality almost always is the morality of process."" Alexander Bickel, The Morality of Consent 123 (1975). The process described in Professor Tonkovich's complaint, a hearing spanning nine months in conjunction with two post-termination remedies, clearly comports with the process required by the law of our land. The Due Process Clause does not guarantee that the University of Kansas would reach a result with which Professor Tonkovich agreed. In summary, we conclude that the district court erred when it denied the defendants' motions to dismiss based on qualified immunity. We hold that each of the individual defendants is entitled to qualified immunity on Professor Tonkovich's remaining § 1983 claims, i.e., violations of procedural due process, substantive due process, and equal protection rights. We REVERSE the district court's ruling to the contrary and REMAND the case to the district court with instructions to dismiss the remaining § 1983 claims against the individual defendants on qualified immunity grounds and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The North County nursing instructor was convicted Monday on charges of sexual battery by restraint, false imprisonment and drug possession.

Jurors found Kelley Edward Edley, 41, guilty of sexually assaulting three women including a co-worker and a student, according to our media partners the North County Times. 

Edley was arrested on charges of assault with intent to commit rape, sexual battery and false imprisonment, Vista sheriff's Detective Dave Brannan said.

“In each case, he held a position of “trust” over the victims, or was a coworker,” Sgt. Art Wager said at the time of Edley's arrest in December 2009.

In two of the three cases the victims were acquainted with Edley either as co-workers at health care facilities or a teacher/student relationship at Kaplan College in Vista.

Edley was found not guilty of assault with intent to commit rape in connection with one victim and the judge dismissed the other count in that case, a felony sexual battery, according to Edley's defense attorney Rich Berkon. That charge then became a misdemeanor.

Edley's sentencing date is set for Oct. 12.

[Photo courtesy of lafayette.edu]After 14 years of teaching, tenured Associate Professor of Physics Andrew Kortyna left the employment of Lafayette College on Mar. 31 under unclear circumstances. He was accused of sexual harassment by two students during his time at Lafayette and also filed a lawsuit against the college and the former provost.
Department Head of Physics Andrew Dougherty confirmed Kortyna left the employment of the college on Mar. 31, but declined to comment on why Kortyna left.
Kortyna was accused of sexual harassment in 2013 by two students. Because his request to have a lawyer represent him at the college’s hearings about the sexual harassment cases was denied, he filed suit against the college in April 2014, according to court records. He also filed suit against Former Provost Wendy Hill for intentional emotional distress.
U.S. District Court Judge Lawrence Stengel dismissed the lawsuit against the college and Kortyna withdrew the suit against Hill in Sept. 2014.
“Even viewing these facts in the light most favorable to him, Dr. Kortyna has failed to show a lack of good faith by Lafayette, which is necessary to make out a failure to accommodate claim,” the judge wrote in his decision. “While Lafayette did not grant him the accommodation he requested, Lafayette has made it a good faith effort to accommodate for his disability.”
The outcomes of the sexual harassment cases are unknown to The Lafayette.
Kortyna claimed he had an emotional breakdown because of the sexual harassment allegations and Hill’s actions against him, according to court records. Because he was having anxiety attacks and experiencing depression, Kortyna was prescribed anti-anxiety medication by his doctor.
According to court records, his inability to cope with the hearing procedure was the reason he requested to have his lawyer present. The college’s policies prohibit outside legal representation during disciplinary hearings.
During the sexual harassment hearing, Kortyna reportedly did have an outbreak, according to court records. Proceedings were delayed the next day. But, instead of returning to the proceedings, he filed suit against the college.
Neither Kortyna’s lawyer nor Hill responded for comment before deadline.
While the lawsuit was still active, Hill left Lafayette’s employment on June 30 and, on July 1, became the head of The Anges Irwin School, an all-girls private school in Rosemont, Pa.
Robert Cohn, who was the chair of the Lafayette College Appeal and Grievance Committee in 2014, came out of retirement to become the Interim Provost in July 1 until the current Provost Abu Rizvi was hired.
President Alison Byerly and Spokesman Roger Clow declined to comment on matters of employment.
Kortyna did not comment before deadline.

			CUNY just can’t seem to keep pervy profs off the payroll.
In a shocking Brooklyn federal court lawsuit, a female undergraduate claims her human-anatomy professor at LaGuardia Community College, Hany Fam, offered her good grades for sex.
The case comes on the heels of bombshell allegations that professors at CUNY’s John Jay College of Criminal Justice raped and tried to pimp out students and used and sold drugs on campus. The widening scandal, now being probed by the Manhattan D.A.’s office and the state Inspector General, was first revealed last month by The Post.
In the lawsuit, the 40-something student, going by the pseudonym Jane Doe, claims she asked Fam for a meeting in October 2017 to discuss grades. The prof, 60, insisted they meet at her apartment, court papers say.
“Fearing that she would offend her professor and perhaps jeopardize her grade in his class, [she] finally relented,” the suit says.
Fam arrived at her Brooklyn apartment and gave her a bottle of wine and a kiss on the cheek, court papers say. He sat on the couch and told her he was “lonely” and had “problems in his marriage,” the suit claims.
He “unbuttoned his shirt to reveal a scar and claimed to have a heart condition that left him with just a few years to live,” the suit says.
The student “got up and went to the kitchen, but Professor Fam followed her, leaned in to hug her, and told her to relax,” court papers say.
After pouring two glasses of wine — which the woman claims she refused to drink — Fam “said that he could make things much easier for her, and repeatedly asked if she would be his ‘friend,’” court papers say.
When the woman asked if “friend” was code for “sex,” he confirmed it was, according to the lawsuit.
“He suggested they meet once a week and told [her] it wouldn’t be ‘that hard’ for her because of his heart condition,” court papers say.
Taking his pitch one step further, Fam said other professors have similar arrangements with students, according to the lawsuit.
When the student made “unambiguous . . . expressions of disinterest,” the prof “became aggravated and told Plaintiff that she was too uptight,” the lawsuit says.

On his way out, Fam handed her “what appeared to be questions and answers for the following day’s scheduled quiz and told [her] to think about his offer.”
The woman did not return to Fam’s class and reported him to the college’s Title IX office, which handles sexual harassment complaints.
The college concluded that Fam “offered [her] a good grade … in exchange for sexual favors,” according to the lawsuit.
A LaGuardia spokeswoman told the Post the professors’s last day in the classroom was the day the student’s complaint was filed, Nov. 7, 2017, and that he was terminated on Jan. 11, 2018. He is “not eligible to work at LaGuardia any time in the future,” said spokeswoman Elizabeth Streich.
The public college located in Long Island City, which offers two-year associates degrees, also agreed to provide counseling for the woman, cover the costs of her course materials and re-enrollment in the class, but did not remove her “withdrawal” from the class on her transcript.
The woman — who is being represented by Carrie Goldberg, the Brooklyn lawyer backing at least two Harvey Weinstein accusers — claims her life has taken a dark turn because of the “emotional stress” of the ordeal. She “has even felt unsafe in her own home because Professor Fam knows where she lives,” the suit says.
The plaintiff told the Post she wants to maintain her anonymity because she is “scared of the repercussions.
“He’s obviously not a nice person, so I don’t know what lengths he might go to. It’s scary for a single woman who lives alone.”
She is seeking unspecified damages and a jury trial.
Court papers also claim Fam was part of a “wider culture of similar behavior by LaGuardia professors.”
In a review for Fam on the Rate My Professor website, a student wrote in October 2017 that he “wastes time on dirty jokes . . . I don’t know how to respect a professor who cracks dirty jokes all the time.”
Fam has been a lecturer at LaGuardia Community College and an adjunct associate professor at CUNY’s York College in Queens since at least 2012, according to SeeThroughNY. He earned $35,000 last year from LaGuardia and $14,000 from York.
Fam could not be reached for comment.

A Lehigh University faculty member, who is a prominent media figure and seen as a leader of the racial equality movement, has resigned amid an investigation that eventually found “sufficient cause” of sexual misconduct, according to a university email from the provost’s office.
The faculty member was identified as James Braxton Peterson, in the email to faculty and staff sent Tuesday. Peterson, a popular professor, is a regular contributor on MSNBC discussing issues such as gun violence, President Donald Trump’s administration and racial equality.
In addition to being an English professor, he was also head of the Africana studies at Lehigh.
According to the email viewed by The Morning Call, verified by university spokesperson Lori Friedman, Lehigh was made aware of “allegations of sexual and other misconduct” against Peterson on Nov. 7.
				
He was placed on leave and not permitted on campus, the email said. Attempts Tuesday to contact Peterson were unsuccessful.
A university investigation showed allegations of misconduct were made by “multiple individuals against Dr. Peterson,” according to the email.				
After receiving the reports but prior to provost Patrick Farrell’s formal decision, Peterson unconditionally resigned his position immediately, the email said.
While Peterson’s resignation made disciplinary action moot,  Farrell, following his own review of the investigative findings, “determined there was sufficient cause to initiate the process that could result in revocation of tenure and termination of employment.”
Bethlehem police Chief Mark DiLuzio said his department was not involved in the investigation. Lehigh police Chief Jason Schiffer directed all questions to Friedman, who declined to say if police were involved in the investigation.
The allegations against Peterson come amid the nationwide #MeToo movement, which gives a voice to sexual assault and harassment victims. The movement has been gaining momentum in Hollywood, among the media and the academia world.
Peterson was often quoted in the media on issues that related to race. Last year, he talked to The Associated Press about the Bill Cosby trial.
“The Cosby team [now] cares about how the public and maybe even how the black community feels about this whole situation, which is striking given his diatribes against the most vulnerable people in that community. But we’ve seen stranger things in these big trials,” Peterson said at the time. “It’s ironic how he makes that pivot, given that he’s demonized poor black people in the past.”
This fall semester at Lehigh, he taught a Contemporary Black Poetics English course. In November, another professor took over his class.
He wrote several books, including “The Hip Hop Underground and African American Culture” and “Prison Industrial Complex for Beginners.” He hosted “The Remix” on Philadelphia’s NPR affiliate WHYY. The podcast is about race, issues and popular culture.
WHYY spokesperson Art Ellis said Tuesday the podcast will no longer be distributed because of the allegations against Peterson.
Peterson was still making public appearances while on leave, although, at least in some cases, he was no longer listed as a Lehigh professor. On Monday, he wrote a commentary on Fortune.com about Martin Luther King Jr. and Trump.
He is scheduled as a speaker at a Martin Luther King Jr. celebration at Lock Haven University later this month. Lock Haven did not respond to a message asking if that was still planned.
Peterson was selected for a fellowship for spring 2018 at Harvard University’s Hutchins Center for African and African American Research. He is still listed on the Hutchins Center’s website.
Peterson’s biography has since been removed from Lehigh’s website.

http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-7564-untoward_mentor.html,"Last month, the dean of LewisClark Graduate School of Education and Counseling announced he would resign at the end of the 2007-2008 school year after five years in that position. 	In an interview with WW , Peter Cookson said he wanted to commit more time to his family and writing projects. Among other things, Cookson is the president of the board of directors of the Portland Schools Foundation, a powerful nonprofit group with ties to the City of Portland and Portland Public Schools.	WW' s review of hundreds of pages of public documents suggests Cookson's resignation may not have been his decision. 	An out-of-court settlement reached on April 19 stems from allegations by Cookson's former assistant, Vanessa Fawbush, that from February 2005 until Sept. 12, 2005, Cookson made sexual advances toward her, harassed her and created a hostile work environment. Fawbush alleges Cookson told her he wanted her to have his baby. Cookson says what transpired was ""just a weird situation.""	The out-of-court settlement (for an undisclosed sum) prohibits both Fawbush, 37, and Cookson, 64, from talking in detail. At the same time, Cookson did tell WW  that the lawsuit ""has nothing to do with"" his announced resignation. Meanwhile, Fawbush's lawyer, Robert Callahan, is careful to adhere to the confidentiality of the settlement.	""In the perfect world, the facts would rebut Dr. Cookson's innuendos,"" Callahan says. ""In the legal world, the constraints placed on Ms. Fawbush prevent her from commenting publicly.""	Separate from the lawsuit (and prior to it), LewisClark hired an investigator to look into the allegations, which Fawbush reported to the human resources department on Sept. 12, 2005.	Seven days later, on Sept. 19, the college's investigator wrote, ""There is significant evidence of the dean's actions, comments and behaviors being intimidating to Ms. Fawbush and causing her personal concern and stress."" On the same day, the college gave Cookson a disciplinary memo.	""Recognizing that there are substantiated findings of violation of the [college's harassment] policy, the college may wish to consider this a matter of such serious degree, that it would serve both the interests of the college and the individual if this individual resigned from his post,"" Anna Sestrich, the investigator, wrote.	Notably, Sestrich did not recommend firing Cookson. Thomas Hochstettler, president of LewisClark, did not respond to two requests for comment. David Ellis, general counsel for the college, says Cookson is ""leaving of his own free will."" 	Fawbush's lawyer says Fawbush considered Cookson a mentor. But her relationship with her boss was abused, he says. ""The strong emotion that you express to me in words and in writing makes me uncomfortable because I don't know how to respond and you seem to be getting more angry with me more and more often,"" Fawbush wrote to Cookson in an office email on Sept. 9, 2005.	Following the complaint, Fawbush requested a job transfer and was reassigned to a new position at the college. In August 2006, she filed a new complaint against the college with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries, alleging that her career had suffered as a result of the transfer, while there had been ""no outward effect apparent on Dr. Cookson.""	The bureau closed the complaint in February 2007, finding that Fawbush did not have a case against the college. Yet, ""her allegations against Dr. Cookson were substantiated,"" Amy Klare, a bureau manager told WW .	Documents filed with the Oregon Bureau of Labor and Industries include a number of handwritten letters from Cookson to Fawbush. They are alternately romantic and unsettling. He calls her ""pooh-bear,"" tells her he loves her, gives her gifts and, on one occasion, encloses $200 in cash. 	In one he writes:	Dear Vanessa, There is a place in my heart for you that will never leave. I hope we can find a way to be in rhythm with each other because the Gods have asked us to create together, to love together and to change the world together. Be well, my beloved. Peter 	In another he writes that Fawbush, who is white, cannot expect a ""genuine"" relationship with her black boyfriend. ""For you or any of us to understand the psychology and hidden desires of a 27 year old black man is difficult perhaps impossible at the deepest level,"" Cookson writes. ""I do know that most of [the] time the pursuit of white women is an expression of race and not a genuine romance.""	Cookson will remain on the graduate school's faculty after he steps down from his post as dean in June 2008. As of Tuesday, Sept. 4, Cookson's name was still listed on the college's website as a ""contact person"" for reporting incidents of sexual harassment.WWeek 2015"
http://victimsover18.blogspot.com/2010/03/liberty-university-professor-sentenced.html,"
A former Liberty University professor was sentenced to 6 months in jail and 5 years suspended by a Lynchburg, VA judge Friday for molesting a 21 year old student of his. Joshua Young Moon, 45 and of Durham, NC, molested a then 21 year old student April 21 while she fell asleep during a massage in his office. Moon, her statistics professor, massaged her to relieve injuries suffered during a car crash.

Before being sentenced, Moon apologized to the woman, her family and his family and friends. Moon’s wife offered tearful testimony on his behalf during the hearing, saying she was still proud of him. She staggered when trying to return to her seat and had to be helped by a deputy.

Moon, 45, of Durham, N.C., said he did not intend to hurt the woman, and asked for forgiveness. He said his only hope now would be to live the rest of his life as a useful member of society. “I wish I could go back and do things differently,” he said. 

His defense attorney, Randy Trost, said the ""socially naive and sexually inexperienced"" professor misinterpreted the woman's massage request and help she got on exams as welcoming the groping. He said that his client's psychological testing indicated a low likelihood of further sexual assaults.

Assistant Commonwealth’s Attorney Rebecca Wetzel said that Moon was a sexual predator because he used his influence to do the same thing to two victims present in the courtroom. ""This defendant is a minister and held a position of trust and authority at Liberty University."" She also said that Moon acted out the bondage and massage porn he stored and viewed on his computer at Liberty University. ""The defendant took advantage of the fact he had a sleeping woman in his office to act out a pornographic act,” said Wetzel.

Judge Mosby Perrow ordered Moon, who was behind bars after pleading guilty on January 22, to pay for the woman's counseling, serve 2 years of supervised probation, and register as a sex offender and undergo sex offender treatment. He was also orderd to have no contact with the victim or children outside of his family. “If I could give you five years for what you’ve done to your wife, I would give you five years for that, too,”  he said.

https://www.thecrcconnection.com/news/2018/03/16/student-and-faculty-call-on-los-rios-board-to-change-how-sexual-harassment-is-handled-in-district/,"A Cosumnes River College student and members of the faculty addressed the Los Rios Community College District Board of Trustees Wednesday to demand the district changes the way it handles complaints of sexual harassment.
The calls came following a documented case of sexual harassment on campus experienced by the student, 19-year-old psychology major Iris Perez.
“I felt like I needed to speak up and enact more change and achieve justice for my case as well as other students’ cases and possibly encourage other students to speak up and for them not to be afraid and to have them know that they’re not alone,” Perez said during the meeting.
During an emotional statement, Perez spoke of a meeting she had on Jan. 2 with Hoyt Fong, a counselor who worked at CRC for more than 30 years. During the Jan. 2 meeting, Fong made an uninvited sexual advance towards Perez.
Perez filed a complaint to Human Resources who then investigated the allegations of sexual harassment.
Perez was informed in a Jan. 11 email from Ryan Cox, vice chancellor of human resources, that Fong had resigned effective immediately, and she was also asked if she then wanted to drop her complaint, according to a copy of the email obtained by The Connection.
Director of Human Resources Susan Slager concluded that the allegation was proven true based on Perez’s credible testimony and no rebuttal evidence from Fong, according to Slager’s Jan. 18 letter to Perez, a copy of which was obtained by The Connection.
“It is the fault of the district for handling this incident poorly who asked me to drop my complaint and letting a predator get away with a clean record,” Perez said during the meeting.
College President Edward Bush attended the meeting and said that their response has to be quick and swift to ensure that students are safe on campus.
“We need to make sure that all our students are safe and protected in any environment that they’re in; counseling sessions, inside of classrooms, interactions with other students,” Bush said.
English Professor David Weinshilboum has been Perez’s advocate throughout the investigation.
“Iris is here because she does not want others to experience what she endured,” Weinshilboum said. “This months-long process she has withstood has left her unconvinced that she or other members of the community are properly protected from acts of sexual misconduct.”
While Fong was employed on campus, he was part of the college’s Safe Spaces program.
The Safe Spaces program was established in 2009 to create an inclusive campus where faculty and students respect each other’s views and may seek assistance during difficult times.
Sociology Professor Donnisha Lugo said during the meeting that the incident “came as a shock” to members of the Safe Spaces program.
“Although the district may be legally bound to protect the privacy and records of personnel, there is no excuse for allowing an individual with a record of harassment claims to continue to serve our students,” Lugo said.
Jason Newman, campus president of the Los Rios College Federation of Teachers, said there are reasons for keeping complaints confidential.
“When a faculty member faces any kind of disciplinary action that is private information that is kept with the faculty member and management as they work it out and is not released to other faculty members or students,” Newman said.
Cox said the district’s processes and practices are not perfect. He added that they will take the input from the meeting and continue to improve.
“I think it’s important for everyone to understand we take these matters absolutely seriously, we have for years and any recent complaint was taken with just as much seriousness as any other complaint,” said Cox.
Former Academic Senate President and Biology Professor Julie Oliver said she’s known of numerous cases where someone has been accused of wrong-doing, an investigation takes place and nothing ever happens. She, along with other faculty at the meeting, called for change in the way the district handles sexual harassment claims.
“You are complicit in allowing this person to have access to our students and the process has to change,” Oliver said, and later added that the college district was being “called out.”
Chancellor Brian King briefly addressed the issue during the meeting.
“I don’t want any student to leave this thinking that we don’t care very deeply about your safety and well-being,” King said.
Weinshilboum said he’d like a sea change to occur in the way complaints are handled in district.
“I want sexual misconduct to be discussed openly and honestly,” said Weinshilboum. “I want leaders who have the fortitude to speak Hoyt Fong’s name and tell the community that he is no longer welcome on campus.”

113 F. Supp. 2d 722 (2000)
Joseph DEMKO, Plaintiff,
v.
LUZERNE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE, Defendant.
No. 3:CV-98-0495.
United States District Court, M.D. Pennsylvania.
September 18, 2000.
*723 *724 *725 Al Flora, Jr., Wilkes-Barre, PA, for Joseph Demko.
Alexia Kita Blake, Hourigan Kluger Spohrer, Scranton, PA, Paul K. Paterson, Scranton, PA, for Luzerne County Community College. 
MEMORANDUM
VANASKIE, Chief Judge.
On March 25, 1998, the plaintiff, Joseph Demko, brought this action against the defendant, Luzerne County Community College (""LCCC"" or ""the College""), under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, for alleged violations of civil rights and under state law for breach of contract. (Dkt. Entry 1.) LCCC employed Demko in its Financial Aid Department, and the complaint arises from the circumstances of LCCC's discharge of Demko from his position. Demko's complaint contains two counts. Demko's first count alleges that LCCC denied him due process related to both property and liberty interests when it discharged him. The second count alleges that LCCC breached a contract between it and Demko that Demko maintains restrained LCCC from discharging him without ""just cause.""
Currently pending are summary judgment motions from both parties. All the issues have been briefed and are ripe for decision.
Because LCCC did not have statutory authority to enter into a non-at-will employment contract with Demko, the alleged contract was void ab initio. As such it did not entitle Demko to any property interest in his continued employment with LCCC. Because Demko had no property interest in his job, he was not entitled to a hearing in connection with the decision to fire him. Accordingly, LCCC's motion for summary judgment on Demko's claim for a deprivation of property rights without due process will be granted, and Demko's motion on that issue will be denied.
Because the contract was void ab initio, the contract is unenforceable. Accordingly, LCCC's motion for summary judgment on the pendent state law claim for breach of contract will be granted, and Demko's motion will be denied.
Because LCCC made public allegations of sexual harassment against Demko at the time of his dismissal, Demko had a liberty interest in clearing his good name and reputation that required the College to afford Demko due process in connection with the decision to fire him. Because the College afforded Demko an adequate opportunity to be heard before he was fired, and state law accorded Demko a full panoply of post-termination procedural rights, the requirements of due process were satisfied in this case. Accordingly, the College's motion for summary judgment on Demko's claim of deprivation of a liberty *726 interest without due process will be granted, and Demko's motion will be denied. 
I. BACKGROUND
Demko worked at the College, in various capacities, from November 1974 until his discharge in November 1997. (Statement of Material Facts to which the Def. Contends there is no Material Dispute, Dkt. Entry 29 at ¶¶ 5-7.) In November of 1991, he was named Financial Aid Officer of LCCC. As an administrator of LCCC, Demko had executed an employment agreement with LCCC on an annual basis. On September 29, 1997, Demko signed a ""Professional Employment Contract"" with LCCC that covered the period October 1, 1997 through September 30, 1998. (Id., ¶ 5 and Ex. 2.) This agreement provided that Demko would ""perform the duties assigned to [the Financial Aid Director] in keeping with the general operational policies of [LCCC] and the policies, rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees of [LCCC]."" (Id.) The phrase, ""policies adopted by the Board of Trustees,"" encompassed LCCC's personnel policy manual applicable to administrators such as Demko. (Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts, Dkt. Entry 39 at ¶ 11.) The personnel policy manual stipulated that ""[e]mployees may be terminated or suspended for just cause,"" and that ""[s]uch discharge should be completed in conjunction with all due process and contractual rights entitled to by the employee."" (Id. at ¶ 12.) The personnel policy manual, however, did not specify the ""due process and contractual rights"" to which an employee was entitled. (Larson Dep., Ex. 2 to Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts, Dkt. Entry 40 at 13.)
At the time that Demko executed the Professional Employment Contract covering the period October 1, 1997 through September 30, 1998, he was on ""probation"" on account of a complaint made by Barbara Brody, a female subordinate of Demko who charged Demko with using vulgar language and creating a hostile work environment. (Pl.'s Statement of Material Facts in Opp'n To Def.'s Summ. J. Mot., Dkt. Entry 48 at ¶ 1.) Brody began work as a clerk in the Financial Aid Department in 1994. (Demko Dep., Dkt. Entry 31.) Sometime prior to April of 1995, Brody complained to College administrators that Demko had sexually harassed her. (Id. at 34.) On April 3, 1995, Demko met with Susan Merkle, Associate Dean of Human Resources, Thomas Leary, Dean of Admissions and Student Affairs, and Ann Williams, Dean of Community Services and Continuing Education. (Id. at 32.) At this meeting, Demko and the College administrators discussed the complaints that Brody had made. (Id. at 34.) The administrators gave Demko the opportunity to respond to Brody's complaints. (Id. at 39.) Demko generally denied the allegations of sexual harassment, but he did not deny that he had used vulgar language in the Financial Aid Department. (Id. at 35.) Shortly after the meeting of April 3, 1995, Demko received a letter from Leary in which Leary explained that the College concluded that Demko had ""made remarks to Ms. Brody that had sexual or demeaning implications."" (Id. at 40  Ex. 3.) The letter also stated that Demko must attend seminars ""dealing with issues on Management Skills and Harassment ...."" (Id.) The letter further informed Demko that he had the right to ""exercise the option of a formal hearing.""[1] Finally, the letter concluded that ""[a] repetition of the behavior cited in this communication may result in termination of services by [LCCC]."" (Id.)
On May 8, 1997, Demko again met with Leary. They discussed Demko's continued use of vulgar language and the amount of time he spent counseling students. (Id. at 54.) At this meeting, Demko admitted that he continued to use vulgar language ""periodically."" (Id. at 56.) Leary gave *727 Demko the opportunity to respond to issues that the two discussed at this meeting. (Id. at 58-59.) Shortly thereafter, Demko received a letter in which Leary summarized their May 8, 1997 meeting. (Id. at 59  Ex 4.) The letter ""strongly advise[d]"" Demko that ""[v]ulgarity and profanity will not be tolerated,"" and that Leary would ""not hesitate to initiate the process of termination if progress is not immediately made ...."" (Id. at Ex. 4.)
In May of 1997, Brody again complained to administrators that Demko used vulgar language and created a hostile work environment in the Financial Aid Department. (Pl.'s Statement of Material Disputed Facts in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. Entry 48 at ¶ 1.) On June 9, 1997, the College placed Demko on probation, and he was again informed that he must ""attend training seminars relative to issues on management skills and sensitivity."" (Dkt. Entry 31 at 63  Ex. 5.) Demko's probationary period extended through December 19, 1997, at the conclusion of which LCCC was to ""render a decision relative to the probation status."" (Id.)
On October 28, 1997, Brody filed a complaint of sexual harassment with the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission (""PHRC""). (Dkt. Entry 48 at ¶ 2.) On November 5, 1997, Demko met with Leary and Merkle, and they discussed the complaint that Brody had filed. (Dkt. Entry 31 at 66.) Merkle gave Demko a copy of Brody's complaint. (Id.) At this meeting, Demko was put on paid administrative leave, and Leary suggested that Demko should retain counsel. (Id. at 68-70.)
Merkle conducted an investigation into the Brody PHRC complaint, interviewing four of the five full-time employees in the Financial Aid Department. The fifth person, Brody, refused to be interviewed on advice of counsel. (Dkt. Entry 29 at ¶ 25.) On November 12, 1997, Demko met with Merkle to discuss the Brody PHRC complaint. (Dkt. Entry 31 at 72.) At this meeting, Demko had the opportunity to respond to Merkle's questions and to offer any information relative to Brody's complaint. (Id. at 76-77.)
Merkle made the determination that Demko continued to use vulgar language after the College put him on probation on June 8, 1997. (Dkt. Entry 29 at ¶ 24.) Further, Merkle concluded that a hostile work environment existed in the Financial Aid Department. (Id. at ¶ 31.)
On November 24, 1997, Demko met with Merkle and Jon Larson, President of the College. (Dkt. Entry 31 at 167 and Larson Dep., Dkt. Entry 35 at 65-70.) At that meeting, Larson gave Demko a letter stating that the College was discharging Demko for ""continued inappropriate conduct."" (Dkt. Entry 31 at 167.) On December 4, 1997, counsel for Demko requested a ""formal due process hearing to challenge the termination of his employment."" (Dkt. Entry 29 at Ex 6.) On January 19, 1998, counsel for the College confirmed that the College ""[did] not intend to offer [Demko] any post-termination hearing."" (Id. at Ex. 7.) On March 25, 1998, Demko brought suit in this Court. 
II. DISCUSSION 
A. Summary Judgment Standard
A court should grant summary judgment when ""the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). A fact is ""material"" if proof of its existence or non-existence might affect the outcome of the suit under the applicable law. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 248, 106 S. Ct. 2505, 91 L. Ed. 2d 202 (1986). ""[S]ummary judgment will not lie if the dispute about a material fact is `genuine,' that is, if the evidence is such that a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party."" Id.
Initially, the moving party must show the absence of a genuine issue concerning *728 any material fact. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 329, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986). All doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party, and the entire record must be examined in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Continental Ins. Co. v. Bodie, 682 F.2d 436, 438 (3d Cir. 1982).
Once the moving party has satisfied its burden, the nonmoving party ""must present affirmative evidence in order to defeat a properly supported motion for summary judgment."" Anderson, 477 U.S.  at 256-57, 106 S. Ct. 2505. The affirmative evidence must consist of verified or documented materials. Mere conclusive allegations or denials taken from the pleadings are insufficient to withstand a motion for summary judgment once the moving party has presented evidentiary materials. Schoch v. First Fidelity Bancorporation, 912 F.2d 654, 657 (3d Cir.1990); see also Hampton v. Borough of Tinton Falls Police Dep't, 98 F.3d 107, 112 (3d Cir.1996) (""In order to defeat `a properly supported summary judgment motion, the party opposing it must present sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find in its favor.'"" (quoting Groman v. Township of Manalapan, 47 F.3d 628, 633 (3d Cir.1995))); Orson, Inc. v. Miramax Film Corp., 79 F.3d 1358, 1366 (3d Cir.1996) (""If the movant meets this burden, then the opponent ... must counter with specific facts which demonstrate that there exists a genuine issue for trial.""). Rule 56(e) requires the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery, when a party ""fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."" Celotex, 477 U.S.  at 322, 106 S. Ct. 2548; see also Orson, 79 F.3d  at 1366.
The Third Circuit recently summarized the burden of the nonmoving party: [I]f a moving party satisfies its initial burden of proving a prima facie case for summary judgment, the opposing party ""must do more than simply show that there is some metaphysical doubt as to material facts."" Rather, ""[t]here must be sufficient evidence for a jury to return a verdict in favor of the non-moving party; if the evidence is merely colorable or not significantly probative, summary judgment should be granted.""
Boyle v. County of Allegheny, 139 F.3d 386, 393 (3d Cir.1998) (citations omitted). 
B. Demko's Property Interest in his Job
To have a property interest in a governmental position, a person must ""have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it."" Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S. Ct. 2701, 33 L. Ed. 2d 548 (1972). ""Property interests are not created by the Constitution, `they are created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law ....'"" Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 538, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985) (quoting Roth, supra). Courts have recognized that a ""for-cause"" termination provision in an enforceable employment agreement or statute may establish a protected property interest. See Linan-Faye Constr. Co. v. Housing Auth. of City of Camden, 49 F.3d 915, 932 (3d Cir.1995); Sanguigni v. Pittsburgh Bd. of Public Educ., 968 F.2d 393, 401 (3d Cir.1992); Unger v. Nat'l Residents Matching Program, 928 F.2d 1392, 1399 (3d Cir.1991).
Demko contends that he was a party to a valid one-year contract for the period of October 1, 1997 to September 30, 1998. (Pl.'s Br. in Supp. of his Mot. for Summ. J. and in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. Entry 47 at 1  Dkt. Entry 31 at Ex. 2.) The contract in question reads: ""I accept this assignment on the conditions listed above and will perform the duties assigned to said position in keeping with the general operational policies of the College and the policies, rules and regulations adopted by the Board of Trustees ...."" *729 (Dkt. Entry 31 at Ex. 2.) Demko argues that the contract explicitly incorporated policies set forth in the College's personnel policy manual that guarantee that the College would not discharge employees without ""just cause."" (Id.)
The College refutes the validity of the contract, citing Shoemaker v. City of Lock Haven, 906 F. Supp. 230 (M.D.Pa.1995) (McClure, J.), for the proposition that a written contract is unenforceable if the contracting public entity lacked the authority to enter into the contract. The College argues that the enabling legislation for community colleges lacks the explicit authority for the College to enter into such contracts and that Demko's contract was therefore ""neither valid [nor] enforceable."" (Def.'s Br. in Supp. of Mot. for Summ. J., Dkt. Entry 30 at 6.)
Demko argues that three separate pieces of legislation authorize community colleges to enter into employment contracts that are not terminable at will: the Public School Employees Retirement Code, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 8180 et seq.; the Pennsylvania Public School Code, 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 19-1901-A et seq., in conjunction with regulations of the State Board of Education, 22 Pa.Code § 35.11(c); and the Pennsylvania Employees Relations Act (""PERA""), specifically, 43 Pa. Stat. § 1101.301(19). (Dkt. Entry 47 at 11-13.) The College relies on Shoemaker, arguing that the legislation that Demko cites does not satisfy the requirement that a public entity's enabling statute explicitly grant the entity the authority to contract with its employees in contravention of employment-at-will.
In Shoemaker, the court considered a contract between a Third Class City and its Chief of Police. Id. at 235. The city had entered into a contract with the Chief, agreeing that the city would not remove him for a probationary period of six months without ""just cause."" Id. at 233. The court found that such an agreement would create a property interest if the city had the authority to enter into such a contract. Id. at 233. However, Shoemaker went on to hold that the city lacked, ab initio, the authority to enter into such a contract, and that the contract in question was therefore void. Id. at 236.
The court scrutinized the city's enabling legislation, 53 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. §§ 41101-41625, and held that the language provided only general powers  powers that were inadequate to authorize the city to enter into a contract for a time certain with the Chief of Police. Id. In so holding, Shoemaker principally relied on Scott v. Philadelphia Parking Auth., 402 Pa. 151, 166 A.2d 278 (1960), and Cooley v. Pennsylvania Hous. Fin. Agency, 830 F.2d 469 (3d Cir.1987). See also Pivarnik v. Commonwealth, 82 Pa.Cmwlth. 42, 45, 474 A.2d 732 (1984) (""In Pennsylvania, public employees gain an enforceable expectation of continued employment in their jobs through legislative action.""); Stumpp v. Stroudsburg Mun. Auth., 540 Pa. 391, 658 A.2d 333, 334 (1995).
Scott, like the case sub judice, involved a written contract between a public entity and an employee. The court in Scott described the issue confronting it as follows: We are asked to determine the validity of a contract which gives an appointed employee of a public authority a tenure for a period of three years at a fixed salary. The primary issue as we see it is not, as the parties have argued, whether the instant contract is unenforceable as an attempt to bind the succeeding members of the Authority, but whether the making of the contract in the first place was beyond the power of the Authority and hence initially invalid.
Id. at 280. The court held that the Authority did not have such power. Hence, the contract was unenforceable.
Stumpp also addressed a contract between a public entity and one of its employees, and held: As an initial matter, the Authority simply does not have the power under law to enter into contracts of employment *730 that contract away the right of summary dismissal, since the power to confer tenure must be expressly set forth in the enabling legislation. Scott v. Philadelphia Parking Authority, 402 Pa. 151, 166 A.2d 278 (1960); Bolduc v. Board of Supervisors, 152 Pa.Cmwlth. 248, 618 A.2d 1188 (1992), appeal denied, 533 Pa. 662, 625 A.2d 1195 (1993).
658 A.2d  at 334. Stumpp, a 1995 case, went on to explicitly reaffirm the 1960 Scott decision: ""This holding has not been abrogated by either this Court or by the legislature. Appellee presents no case law that refutes the explicit holding of this case."" Id. at 335.
In Cooley, the Third Circuit also addressed the legislative authority for a public entity, the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, to enter into employment contracts. Id. at 473. However, Cooley, unlike Scott, did not involve a written contract; rather it involved the employee's claims that the agency's employee handbook had created certain property interests. Id. at 472.[2] Our Court of Appeals held that in the absence of a specific grant of legislative authority for the public entity to enter into employment contracts that are not terminable at will, the handbook could not support the plaintiff's claim to a property interest. The court explained: [W]e do not find the requisite legislative mandate within the enabling statute to bestow a right upon the agency to enter into employment contracts with its employees. Therefore, Cooley's claim that the contents of the manual embody this contract is void ab initio as no power to contract exists.
Id. at 473. See also Verney v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm'n, 903 F. Supp. 826, 835 (M.D.Pa.1995) (Caldwell, J.) (""In applying the holdings of Scott and Stumpp to the facts of this case, Defendants argue that the statute ... does not grant the Commission the power to contract for a term of employment. Thus, Defendants contend the Commission does not have the power to create an implied in fact contract, and we agree.""); Banks v. Redevelopment Auth. of Philadelphia, 416 F. Supp. 72, 72-73 (E.D.Pa.1976), aff'd, 556 F.2d 564 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 929, 98 S. Ct. 414, 54 L. Ed. 2d 288 (1977) (""Pennsylvania law does not allow a state agency to create tenure unless the legislature specifically grants the agency the power to do so. Mahoney v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, 13 Pa.Cmwlth. 243, 320 A.2d 459 (1974), cert. denied, 419 U.S. 1122, 95 S. Ct. 806, 42 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1975)."").
Scott, Cooley, and their progeny make it clear that for a public employee to claim a property interest in employment in Pennsylvania, the agency must have the specific authority to create that interest. Accordingly, the enabling legislation for community colleges must be examined.
The establishment and operation of community colleges within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is authorized by 24 Pa. Stat. Ann. § 19-1901-A et seq. Section 19-1905-A delineates the power and duties of the board of trustees of a community college. Subsection (a) of § 19-1905-A, in pertinent part, authorizes the board: (1) To appoint and fix the salary of a president .... (5) To make policies providing for the admission and expulsion of students, the courses of instruction, the tuition and fees to be charged and for all matters related to the government and administration of the college .... (8) To exercise such other powers and perform such other duties as are necessary to carry into effect the purposes of this act.
Demko argues that the College's authority under (a) (5) ""necessitates the hiring of qualified personnel as part of a broad based educational scheme."" (Dkt. Entry *731 47 at 12.) Scott considered similarly broad enabling legislation: Under its enabling legislation, Act of June 5, 1947, supra, the Authority is granted ""all powers necessary or convenient for the carrying out of the aforesaid purposes"" including the power ""... (7) To appoint officers, agents, employees and servants; to prescribe their duties and to fix their compensation;"" and the power ""... (10) To make contracts of every name and nature, and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient for the carrying on of its business."" § 5, 53 P.S. § 345.
Id. at 280 (omissions in original). The court interpreted this language to empower the public entity ""to appoint officers, employees and agents and to fix their compensation, not to enter into contracts of employment."" Id. at 282 (emphasis in original). The language that Scott considered is as broad, if not broader, than the enabling language for LCCC. Nevertheless, Scott held that the legislation did not authorize the public entity to enter into employment contracts for a time certain.
The enabling language in Cooley was equally broad; the legislation in question allowed the public entity: (3) To enter into contracts of all kinds and to execute all instruments necessary or convenient for carrying on its operations. *   *   *   *   *   * (14) Employ an executive director and other officers, agents, [employees], professional and business advisors as may from time to time be necessary in its judgment and to fix their compensation; and to promote and discharge such officers, [employees], and agents. *   *   *   *   *   * (17) To do all things necessary if convenient to carry out the powers granted by this act or other acts. 35 Pa.C.S.A. § 1680.205.
Id. at 472 (omissions in original). Despite this broad language, the Third Circuit found that ""these grants of power did not give the Redevelopment Authority the ability to create regulations which altered dismissal at will, the traditional Pennsylvania rule regarding public employees not holding specified tenured positions."" Id.[3]
Demko cites Northampton County Area Community College v. Dow Chem., U.S.A., 389 Pa.Super. 11, 24, 566 A.2d 591 (1989), for the proposition that community colleges are independent of municipalities and authorities. (Dkt. Entry 47 at 11.) Demko argues that the College need not have express authority to enter into contracts because ""it is neither a municipality nor [an] authority."" (Id.) Northampton addressed issues unrelated to those sub judice  the court addressed nullum tempus and the related doctrine of sovereign immunity. Only in that context did the *732 court find that community colleges are independent of their sponsors. In the context of a public entity's authority to enter into employment contracts, such a label is irrelevant.[4]
Neither Scott nor Cooley made such a distinction when they applied the rule that the authority to alter employment-at-will must be express. The plaintiff in Scott worked for the ""Philadelphia Parking Authority"" which was not a state agency, but the court applied the reasoning of a prior case which dealt with a state agency employee, noting that the reasoning of the prior case was ""applicable in general ...."" Id. at 280. Cooley, on the other hand, involved a state agency, the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency. Id. at 470. The reasoning of these precedents does not turn on the status of the agency, but instead turns on the content of the enabling legislation. In this case, the community college enabling legislation does not authorize the College to alter the employment-at-will status of administrators such as Demko.[5]
Demko next cites the Public School Employees' Retirement Code (""PSERC""), 24 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. § 8101 et seq., as authority for the College to enter into a contract for a time certain. (Dkt. Entry 47 at 12.) Neither the statute, nor the case on which Demko relies, Newport Township v. Margalis, 110 Pa.Cmwlth. 611, 532 A.2d 1263 (1987), is applicable to the issues sub judice. Nowhere in PSERC is there language that explicitly authorizes an agency to enter into a contract for a time certain with its employees. Further, Margalis does not even address PSERC, but addresses public employee retirement benefits in general.
Demko also argues that the Pennsylvania Employee Relations Act (""PERA"") provides the statutory authority for the College to enter into a contract for a time certain. (Dkt. Entry 47 at 13.) He cites Curry v. Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm'n, 843 F. Supp. 988, 990 (E.D.Pa.1994), in support of this argument. While it is true that Curry addressed the authority of a public entity to enter into contracts with ""collective bargaining"" units under PERA, id. at 991, it is undisputed that Demko was not a member of a union. Furthermore, the fact that Demko may have been a ""first-level supervisor,"" as that term is defined in PERA, with whom LCCC was required to ""meet and discuss"" on matters deemed bargainable for other public employees covered by PERA does not mean that his contract was covered by PERA. Demko has not presented any facts that support an inference that his agreement was part of an administrator compensation *733 plan covering first-level supervisors.[6] Accordingly, PERA affords no predicate for recognition of a property interest here. As stated in Shoemaker, 906 F.Supp. at 235: ""PERA ... deals exclusively and specifically with the right of public employers to enter into collective bargaining agreements, the right of public employees to organize, etc. See 43 P.S. § 1101.101. No collective bargaining agreement or related issue is raised here.""
Scott and Cooley are clear: the statutory language authorizing employment contracts must be explicit. A court may not infer the legislature's intent from a statute that is on the fringe of the issue. The statute must forthrightly confer the right to contract with employees for a time certain or to abrogate the at-will employment doctrine. If it does not, then the public entity does not have the authority to do so. PERA plainly does not grant to the College the authority to establish non-at-will employment for a non-union employee.
Demko claims that the yearly renewal of administrators' contracts was ""automatic"" and that it therefore created a ""de facto tenure."" (Dkt. Entry 47 at 9.) This argument, of course, fails for the same reasons that Demko's express contract claim fails: the College did not have the authority to enter into a contract with Demko that was not terminable at will.[7] Without the authority to enter into such contracts, the College could enter into neither an explicit nor an implicit, ""de facto,"" contract with Demko.
Because the College did not have the authority to enter into a contract with Demko, he had no property interest in his employment. And because he had no property interest in his employment, Demko had no due process rights related to his continued employment. Cooley, 830 F.2d  at 473 (""We therefore hold that Cooley is devoid of any proprietary interest in his employment which would afford him the protections of the due process clause.""). Accordingly, summary judgment in favor of the College on Demko's deprivation of property claim is appropriate.
Count Two of Demko's complaint is a pendent state breach of contract claim. For the reasons stated above, that claim must be denied. The College did not have authority to enter into the contract, and it is therefore unenforceable. Accordingly, I will grant the College's motion for summary judgment as it relates to that claim. 
C. Demko's Liberty Interest in his Reputation
""In a Constitution for a free people, there can be no doubt that the meaning of `liberty' must be broad indeed."" Roth, 408 U.S.  at 572, 92 S. Ct. 2701 (citing Bolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 499-500, *734 74 S. Ct. 693, 98 L. Ed. 884; and Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 92 S. Ct. 1208, 31 L.Ed.2d 551). ""[W]here a person's good name, reputation, honor, or integrity is at stake because of what the government is doing to him, notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential."" Roth, 408 U.S.  at 573, 92 S. Ct. 2701 (quoting Wisconsin v. Constantineau, 400 U.S. 433, 437, 91 S. Ct. 507, 27 L. Ed. 2d 515 (1971)). See also Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565, 574, 95 S. Ct. 729, 42 L. Ed. 2d 725 (1975) (holding that future employment rights may be liberty interests). The fact that Demko did not have a property interest in his employment is not fatal to his deprivation of liberty claim. Brady v. Gebbie, 859 F.2d 1543, 1553 (9th Cir.1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1100, 109 S. Ct. 1577, 103 L. Ed. 2d 943 (1989); Melo v. Hafer, No. 89-2685, 1992 WL 396816, *3, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19540 at *13 (E.D.Pa. Dec. 22, 1992) (""[F]ailure to prevail on a property claim does not bar a properly asserted liberty claim."").
In the employment context, courts frequently address a deprivation of liberty in terms of stigma. ""[T]he hearing required where a nontenured employee has been stigmatized in the course of a decision to terminate his employment is solely ""to provide the person an opportunity to clear his name."""" Codd v. Velger, 429 U.S. 624, 627, 97 S. Ct. 882, 51 L. Ed. 2d 92 (1977). As recognized in Melo, 1992 WL 396816 at *3, 1992 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 19540 at *12, ""the opportunity for a name-clearing hearing must be afforded.""
In this case, the College effectively published a statement that Demko had been fired for sexual harassment. Clearly, being labeled a sexual harasser is stigmatizing. Demko adamantly denied the charge. Under these circumstances, Demko's firing implicated a liberty interest in his reputation such that he was entitled to an opportunity to clear his name.
The College argues that the published statement surrounding Demko's discharge were not false. (Dkt. Entry 50 at 2.) This argument misses the mark. The question is not whether the published statement was accurate, but whether Demko contested the accuracy of the charge of sexual harassment. Only if the employee does not challenge the substantial truth of the publicized basis for his or her firing is an opportunity to clear one's name obviated. See Codd, 429 U.S.  at 627, 97 S. Ct. 882.
In short, the College's dissemination of the reasons for Demko's discharge implicated a liberty interest. Under these circumstances, he was entitled to an opportunity to be heard before he was fired and the press release issued. See Wallin v. Minnesota Dept. of Corrections, 153 F.3d 681, 690 n. 9 (8th Cir.1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1004, 119 S. Ct. 1141, 143 L. Ed. 2d 209 (1999). A pre-deprivation hearing that satisfies the requirements of Loudermill is adequate. Wallin, 153 F.3d  at 690 n. 9. Loudermill concluded that ""all the process that is due is provided by a pretermination opportunity to respond coupled with post-termination administrative [or judicial] procedures ...."" 470 U.S.  at 547-48, 105 S. Ct. 1487.
Demko does not dispute that Loudermill establishes the parameters for a pre-termination hearing. He does dispute, however, the adequacy of the process afforded him.
In Scarnati v. Washington, 599 F. Supp. 1554 (M.D.Pa.), aff'd, 772 F.2d 896 (3d Cir.1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1056, 106 S. Ct. 795, 88 L. Ed. 2d 772 (1986), the Veterans Administration (""VA"") discharged a non-tenured physician. The plaintiff contended that his firing for incompetence stigmatized him in his profession. Id. at 1557. After holding that the plaintiff had no property interest in his job, the court considered his liberty interest claim, and held that pre-termination hearings were sufficient process to protect that interest. The court first held that Scarnati had himself published the facts surrounding his dismissal, but went on to hold that even if the VA had infringed on Scarnati's liberty *735 interest, the VA provided all the process required when ""the plaintiff ... appeared before the [board] twice and had ample notice of the charges being considered, as well as the opportunity to counter them."" Id. at 1559. Scarnati also contended that the VA violated his due process rights because ""he had never seen three of the twelve exhibits presented to the [board]"" that were complaints about his job performance. Id. at 1558. The court held that ""plaintiff was not entitled to copies of all material reviewed by the [board]."" Id. at 1559.
Demko offers a similar, but even less convincing argument. He argues that the College administrators did not question him about each complaint related to the charges of sexual harassment. (Dkt. Entry 47 at 18.) Demko does not refute, however, that the administrators supplied him with a copy of the PHRC complaint on November 5, 1997. (Dkt. Entry 31 at 66.) Nor does he refute that at the November 12, 1997 meeting he had the opportunity to respond to Merkle's questions and to offer any additional information he wished Merkle to have. (Id. at 76-77.)
Scarnati held that two pre-termination hearings before a three person board were sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff's due process rights to protect a liberty interest. Id. at 1559. In the case sub judice, the College afforded Demko two separate pre-termination meetings: on November 5 and 12, 1997. The length and subjects of these meetings varied, but they addressed the charges which resulted in the College's dismissal of Demko. Moreover, Demko had received a copy of the PHRC complaint seven days before his meeting with Ms. Merkle. At the time he knew he was on probation and that his employment was in jeopardy. While Ms. Merkle may not have asked him about every charge in the PHRC complaint, he certainly had an opportunity to respond to each charge.
In McDaniels, the court held that the Loudermill requirements were met when the tenured professor had been told of the nature of the sexual harassment charges, was interviewed by College officials concerning those charges, and had an ample opportunity to supply information to the College between the time he was notified of the charges and his dismissal. 59 F.3d  at 456-57. McDaniels compels the conclusion that Loudermill's pre-termination requirements were met here. See also Gniotek v. City of Philadelphia, 808 F.2d 241, 244 (3d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 481 U.S. 1050, 107 S. Ct. 2183, 95 L. Ed. 2d 839 (1987) (due process satisfied when discharged employee given notice of charges sufficient to enable him ""to determine what facts, if any, within his knowledge might be presented in mitigation of or in denial of the charges"").
Demko insists that summary judgment is not warranted because he ""denied [the] allegations"" of sexual harassment. (Dkt. Entry 47 at 18.) Whether Demko refuted the charges is not the determinative issue. A court's inquiry is not whether the College made the correct decision, but whether the College afforded Demko the procedural due process that the Constitution guarantees.[8] As the Supreme Court has noted, ""[t]he Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not a guarantee against incorrect or illadvised *736 personnel decisions."" Bishop, 426 U.S.  at 350, 96 S. Ct. 2074.
Demko also claims a denial of due process because the College refused to give him a post-termination hearing. The Loudermill analysis contemplates adequate administrative or judicial post-deprivation procedures.[9] The College asserts that Pennsylvania's Local Agency Law, 2 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. §§ 751, et seq., governed the decision to fire Demko and provided adequate procedural protections. Demko disputes the applicability of the Local Agency Law.
The Local Agency Law, in pertinent part, provides: No adjudication of a local agency shall be valid as to any party unless they shall have been afforded reasonable notice of a hearing and an opportunity to be heard.
2 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann § 553. The Local Agency Law further provides a right to judicial review of any local agency ""adjudication."" Id. at § 752.[10] ""Adjudication"" is defined at 2 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. § 101, as: Any final order, decree, decision, determination or ruling by an agency affecting personal or property rights, privileges, immunities, duties, liabilities or obligations of any or all of the parties to the proceeding in which the adjudication is made.
Demko asserts that the decision to fire him did not constitute an ""adjudication"" subject to the procedural safeguards of the Local Agency Law.
Pennsylvania's Supreme Court has considered this issue and found that the removal of a government employee under circumstances that implicate a liberty interest satisfies the definition of a final adjudication even in a situation involving an at-will employee with no property rights in his job. In Pipkin v. Pennsylvania State Police, 548 Pa. 1, 693 A.2d 190, 194 n. 3 (1997), the court, differentiating between ""property"" and ""personal"" rights, held: A personal right or a privilege which will constitute an adjudication pursuant to Section 101 of the Administrative Law and Procedure Act will arise if the party claiming a privilege can establish either some right or privilege created by statute and characterized as such or some constitutionally protected right or privilege.

(Emphasis added). See also Guthrie v. Borough of Wilkinsburg, 505 Pa. 249, 478 A.2d 1279, 1283 (1984) (""[W]e must also examine whether the action of the Borough intruded upon any personal right, privilege or liberty interest ....""). As noted above, Demko has a constitutionally protected liberty interest in his good name.[11] Accordingly, the College's termination of Demko, coupled with the dissemination of the reasons for Demko's dismissal, constituted an ""adjudication"" under the Local Agency Law. Consequently, Demko had available to him the procedural rights afforded by that statute.
*737 In McDaniels, our Court of Appeals held that the dismissal of a community college professor was an ""adjudication"" under the Local Agency Law and that the procedural protections provided in that law satisfied the due process clause. 59 F.3d  at 460-61. McDaniels thus compels rejection of Demko's challenge to the absence of post-termination process.[12]
The fact that Demko was not accorded the hearing required by the Local Agency Law does not entitle him to seek relief under § 1983 for the denial of due process. As McDaniels recognized, it is enough if the state offered Demko sufficient process to protect his rights. In this regard, Demko had the right to avail himself of judicial review despite the absence of a hearing conducted by the College. Specifically, 2 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. § 754, in pertinent part, provides: (A) INCOMPLETE RECORD.  In the event a full and complete record of the proceedings before the local agency was not made, the court may hear the appeal de novo, or may remand the proceedings to the agency for the purpose of making a full and complete record or for further disposition in accordance with the order of the court.
The Pennsylvania courts have held that where the agency fails to accord the aggrieved party an opportunity to be heard, the aggrieved party is entitled to a remand to the agency for a hearing. See Turner v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm'n, 683 A.2d 942, 946-47 (Pa.Commw.1996); Foster v. Board of Sch. Directors of Keystone Oaks Sch. Dist., 678 A.2d 1214 (Pa. Commw.1996). Thus, the availability of state court review of the College's actions, whether or not Demko made use of that review, satisfied the requirements of the due process clause. Because state law accorded Demko due process protections in connection with the termination of his employment, the College's motion for summary judgment must be granted. 
III. CONCLUSION
Because the enabling legislation that established the College did not contain explicit language that granted the College authority to enter into contracts for a time certain, Demko's one-year contract was void and unenforceable. Although Demko's discharge may have implicated a protected liberty interest, the undisputed facts show that he received an appropriate pre-termination opportunity to be heard, and state law afforded Demko post-termination procedural rights that satisfied the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause. Because Demko received all the process the Constitution requires, and Demko does not have an enforceable contract, the College's motion for summary judgment will be granted and Demko's motion for summary judgment will be denied.
NOTES
[1]  There is no indication that Demko requested a formal hearing in connection with the matters raised in the April 3, 1995 letter.
[2]  Significantly, Demko relies, at least in part, on a personnel policy manual that he contends guaranteed that he would be dismissed only for ""just cause."" Thus, Cooley is an especially pertinent precedent here.
[3]  Perri v. Aytch, 724 F.2d 362 (3d Cir.1983), which held that a state court probationary employee had a property interest in her employment, is distinguishable because at issue in that case, and absent here, was the ""the importance of preserving the independence of the judiciary by allowing it to hire and fire its own employees free of interference from the other branches of government."" Id. at 364. Thus, the legislature's explicit authorization to enter into employment contracts with court personnel for a fixed time period was not required as to the court employee in Perri. Significantly, the court in Perri acknowledged the general rule that ""administrative agencies in Pennsylvania do not have the power to grant tenure absent the legislature's permission to do so."" Id. Also distinguishable is Abraham v. Pekarski, 537 F. Supp. 858 (E.D.Pa.1982), aff'd, 728 F.2d 167 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 467 U.S. 1242, 104 S. Ct. 3513, 82 L. Ed. 2d 822 (1984), which found a city engineer had a property interest in his public employment because of the interplay of a Township ordinance prohibiting his removal ""without just cause"" and case law under the Local Agency Law, 2 Pa. Cons.Stat. Ann. §§ 551, et seq., recognizing that the discharge of a public employee protected by such an ordinance constituted an adjudication of a property interest. No such legislative authorization is present here. Abraham is also distinguishable because it did not address whether the Township ordinance was beyond the authority of the Township's governing body.
[4]  Community colleges are ""local agencies"" for purposes of Pennsylvania's Local Agency Law. McDaniels v. Flick, 59 F.3d 446, 460-61 (3d Cir.1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1146, 116 S. Ct. 1017, 134 L. Ed. 2d 97 (1996).
[5]  Demko argues that Small v. Juniata College, 452 Pa.Super. 410, 682 A.2d 350 (1996), stands for the proposition that ""just cause"" clauses can create property entitlements for employees. Earlier, however, he notes that he ""has not alleged that the personnel policies of the College, independent of his written contract, create an employment contract."" (Dkt. Entry 47 at 10.) The ""just cause"" argument, however, sidesteps the holding of Scott and Cooley. A public entity must first have the authority to enter into an employment contract before it can offer limitations on discharge from that employment. In any event, Small involved a private institution.

Demko also relies on Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 92 S. Ct. 2694, 33 L. Ed. 2d 570 (1972), as support for the argument that the College created a tenure ""system in practice."" (Dkt. Entry 47 at 10.) Perry is inapposite for a variety of reasons. Foremost is the fact that it addressed a college system in Texas. Here the issue is whether Pennsylvania law allows a public entity to contract with its employees for a time certain. Second, Perry relied, at least to some extent, on the plaintiff's claims that the college had violated his First Amendment rights; here there is no such claim.
Demko also cites Stana v. School Dist. of Pittsburgh, 775 F.2d 122 (3d Cir.1985), in support of his claims. That case, however, does not address the issue of a public entity's authority to contract with its employee, but rather the issue of an applicant's right to remain on an ""eligibility list.""
[6]  Demko's reliance on Curley v. Board of Sch. Dir. of the Greater Johnstown Sch. Dist., 163 Pa.Cmwlth. 648, 641 A.2d 719 (1994), is misplaced. That case dealt with the effect of the ""meet and discuss"" provision in § 1164 of the Public School Code, 24 P.S. § 11-1164, and not with PERA's ""meet and discuss"" provision, 43 P.S. § 1101.704. The court in Curley noted that there were significant distinctions between those two statutes, with the latter imposing no requirements on public employees beyond meeting and discussing bargainable issues with non-union employees.
[7]  Demko does not argue equitable estoppel. Shoemaker noted some disagreement as to the application of equitable estoppel to the doctrine of employment-at-will in Pennsylvania. However, here, like in Shoemaker, I need not reach the issue. Demko has not alleged ""negligent misrepresentation of a material fact inducing [him] to act to his detriment,"" id. at 236-37, and accordingly he has no claim on that issue. It is noteworthy, however, that Stumpp, 540 Pa. 391, 658 A.2d 333 at 336, forthrightly addressed the issue of equitable estoppel in Pennsylvania, and held:

[E]quitable estoppel has been affirmatively rejected by this Court as an exception to the at-will rule. In Paul v. Lankenau Hospital, 524 Pa. 90, 569 A.2d 346 (1990), we held that ""[t]he doctrine of equitable estoppel is not an exception to the employment at will doctrine. An employee may be discharged with o[r] without cause, and our law does not prohibit firing an employee for relying on an employer's promise.""
[8]  The Supreme Court, in Bishop v. Wood, 426 U.S. 341, 350, 96 S. Ct. 2074, 48 L. Ed. 2d 684 (1976), noted:

The federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the multitude of personnel decisions that are made daily by public agencies. We must accept the harsh fact that numerous individual mistakes are inevitable in the day-to-day administration of our affairs. The United States Constitution cannot feasibly be construed to require federal judicial review for every such error. In the absence of any claim that the public employer was motivated by a desire to curtail or to penalize the exercise of an employee's constitutionally protected rights, we must presume that official action was regular and, if erroneous, can best be corrected in other ways.
[9]  In Loudermill, the Court noted that ""[a]lthough the Commission's decision was subject to judicial review in the state courts, Loudermill instead brought the present suit in Federal Court."" Id. at 536, 105 S. Ct. 1487. The Court further held that ""the existence of post-termination procedures is relevant to the scope of pretermination procedures."" Id. at 547, 105 S. Ct. 1487. The Court concluded that ""all the process that is due is provided by a pretermination opportunity to respond, coupled with post-termination administrative procedures as provided by the Ohio statute."" Id. at 547-48, 105 S. Ct. 1487.
[10]  Section 752 provides:

Any person aggrieved by an adjudication of a local agency who has a direct interest in such adjudication shall have the right to appeal therefrom to the court vested with jurisdiction of such appeals by or pursuant to Title 42 (relating to judiciary and judicial procedure).
[11]  See Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 708-09, 96 S. Ct. 1155, 47 L. Ed. 2d 405 (1976), holding that stigmatizing publications can, when coupled with changes in property status, support a cause of action even when there is no underlying right in the property interest.
[12]  If Demko had a property interest in his employment, McDaniels would also compel rejection of his procedural due process claims.

                                The chancellor of one of the nation’s largest community college
systems is being fired amid accusations of improper conduct around
women, according to performance evaluations released Tuesday.
With a unanimous vote and little discussion, the fivemember
governing board of the Maricopa Community College District at their
Tuesday meeting chose to terminate the contract of chancellor Fred
Gaskin, who was hired three years ago after a nationwide
search.
Gaskin left a private meeting with the board on May 12 after his
2003 performance evaluation was reviewed. Gaskin, who oversees 10
county colleges — including Scottsdale and Paradise Valley
community colleges — has been on paid personal leave ever since. He
could not be reached for comment.


        Comments by unidentified board members in the 2002 and 2003
evaluations, which were previously withheld, include:
• Women reported feeling uncomfortable by the way Gaskin ""looks
at them with his up -anddown glances and his stares at the upper
part of the body.""
• ""Your treatment of women borders on sexual harassment and only
their fear prevents them from filing charges against you.""
• ""Females . . . are uncomfortable with your staring at them and
won’t ride alone in the elevator with you.""
A recent allegation involves a trip to Washington, D.C., in
February that was designed to allow students to learn more about
politics.
On that trip, which was attended by the governing board members
and other district officials, ""a female student was embarrassed by
your comments at the banquet and thought that you and others with
you were inebriated,"" the 2003 evaluation states.
Governing board president Ed Contreras said Gaskin’s alleged
behavior on that trip was discussed during the private session May
12, but he would not elaborate.

        Vice chancellor Steve Helfgot, who once worked with Gaskin at
Cerritos College in California, sat with the chancellor at the Feb.
10 banquet, but told the Tribune he did not see Gaskin drunk or
hear him make improper comments.
Gaskin generally received high marks by the board in his first
evaluation in 2001. Many ""good"" and ""excellent"" ratings were given
in 2002, as well for Gaskin’s job in planning, financial
leadership, increasing community support in college programs and
other areas.
But in 2002, members wondered whether Gaskin fully supported the
board’s ideas for the college district’s future. Hispanic hiring
had not been improving as expected. And concerns were raised that
Gaskin treated men with more respect than women and made sexist
comments.
""At best, this is unprofessional and unbecoming, and at worst
could bring about a lawsuit against the district,"" a board member
wrote.
Despite those concerns, Gaskin was allowed to enter a new
four-year contract in May 2002, one that paid him each year
$198,884 in base salary, $12,000 in automobile expenses, $5,000 in
undocumented expenses, $20,000 in deferred compensation, and 32
days of vacation.
Comments by board members in the most recent appraisal chronicle
a far worse relationship. Gaskin was reported to play favorites,
exclude women and minorities from his ""inner circle,"" work poorly
with those who didn’t share his view, and act like an arrogant
bully.
The only question now is how many tax dollars will be needed to
satisfy both parties. Gaskin wants to be paid for the full three
years remaining on the four-year contract, Contreras said. That
would amount to almost $750,000.
Contreras said the board had hoped Gaskin would resign, but he
wanted too much money to leave. The board will vote on a final
resolution, detailing whatever agreement is reached.
""We believe this is the right action for the Maricopa community
colleges to continue to flourish,"" Contreras said.

https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/03/26/massart-professor-retires-amid-title-ix-investigation,"Nicholas Nixon, a well-known professor of photography at Massachusetts College of Art and Design, retired this month amid allegations of inappropriate behavior, The Boston Globe reported. President David Nelson announced Nixon's departure in an email to students and faculty members last week, saying, “We take reports of any form of sexual harassment, inappropriate behavior or misconduct seriously” and that was Nixon was no longer in the classroom.
Nixon reportedly referred requests for comment to his attorney, Bruce A. Singal, who said in a statement that Nixon received notice of a college investigation “into reports that he allegedly made inappropriate comments in the presence of students and staff members.” Singal said Nixon is “widely known for a provocative teaching style in a creative art school environment that he believed was inspiring to his students” and that “we hope the investigation can be completed before any conclusions are drawn.”

http://www.mit.edu/activities/safe/cases/mit-tewhey/tewhey-resign-report,"Charges of Harassment Fly As Dean Ends Six-Year Tenure

   By Josh Hartmann
   
   Photography Editor
   
   Associate Dean for Student Affairs James R. Tewhey resigned yesterday
   afternoon amid charges and countercharges of harassment, as well as
   claims of mismanagement in his office.
   
   ""He has some problems I think he needs to address at this time,"" said
   Provost Mark S. Wrighton, who accepted Tewhey's resignation. ""I think
   he has made the commitment to resolve them. I think he has done the
   right thing for himself and for MIT.""
   
   Tewhey is involved in a court battle with Katherine M. Nolan,
   associate director of student financial aid, with whom he had an
   18-month affair. Tewhey is currently under a restraining order
   preventing contact with Nolan and her 9-year-old daughter. The order
   was issued after both parties exchanged affidavits claiming
   harassment.
   
   Wrighton also praised Tewhey for his six years of service at MIT.
   ""He's been in a very difficult administrative position at MIT,""
   Wrighton said. ""He has executed his responsibilities well.""
   
   President Charles M. Vest said last night he had ""no personal
   comment."" Tewhey did not respond to messages left last night.
   
  EISENMANN ASSUMES DUTIES
  
   
   
   Assistant Dean for Student Affairs Andrew M. Eisenmann '75 was handed
   Tewhey's day-to-day duties as head of the residence and campus
   activities section yesterday, according to Kenneth D. Campbell,
   director of the news office. While Dean for Undergraduate Education
   and Student Affairs Arthur C. Smith is on vacation, Associate Dean
   Robert M. Randolph will assume overall responsibility for Tewhey's
   department.
   
   ""This is a difficult situation for all of us,"" Randolph said in a
   statement to housemasters. ""Jim has made major contributions to the
   MIT community that have made this a better place.""
   
  MANAGEMENT STYLE QUESTIONED
  
   
   
   Tewhey's resignation and allegations surrounding his affair with Nolan
   will undoubtedly fuel the controversy over the Institute's handling of
   sexual harassment complaints.
   
   ""I think the students will be well-served in the future as I think
   they have been in the past,"" Wrighton said. ""I hope we can continue to
   provide the services we have in the past.""
   
   Past and present employees who worked under Tewhey offered conflicting
   opinions of Tewhey's managerial ability before news of yesterday's
   resignation spread.
   
   Humanities lecturer Ann Russo has dealt with Tewhey on a number of
   occasions as a lecturer in the Women's Studies Program. ""There's been
   a number of students and staff who have come to me with a number of
   problems they've had dealing with Tewhey,"" she said, adding that she
   felt many harassment cases were not handled properly.
   
   ""He did some inappropriate management things,"" said Adam Goodie, a
   former Dean's Office assistant who worked in the Undergraduate
   Asssociation office. ""He had very little contact with me, which bugged
   me.""
   
   But Mary Ni, assistant dean for student affairs, tells a different
   story. ""I did hear from some people that he wasn't a good boss,"" she
   said. ""My personal assessment is that I think he's pretty good. I have
   found him to be very fair and thoughtful. His managerial style is
   loose, but I don't find it terribly problematic.""
   
   Although sources said formal complaints were made regarding Tewhey's
   management procedure, Wrighton said he was not aware of those concerns
   and would not comment on personnel matters.
   
   ""I suspected MIT's plan was to get him out as soon as possible,"" said
   one source who has worked with Tewhey. ""It looks better for him to
   resign than be fired. I don't think he stands any chance of getting a
   student affairs position in Boston. It was a _fait accompli_ that he
   was going to leave,"" said the source, who requested anonymity.

That made his MOOCs a good fit for Faïza Harbi, 32, a private English tutor living in Montpellier, France. Harbi spoke openly to Inside Higher Ed but asked that her maiden name be used. She said she decided to take a physics course after struggling with the subject in high school. She was not familiar with the rock star professor, whose more than four decades at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, innovative and hugely popular video lectures and hundreds of scholarly articles had earned him international acclaim.
To connect with other learners in the MOOC, Harbi searched Facebook for groups dedicated to the course but found none, so she created one herself. On Nov. 24, 2013, someone with the profile name Walter Lewin requested to join the group. Believing it to be a parody account, Harbi approved the request and asked for proof. Within minutes, she received an email with a screenshot of her Progress page -- a tool only individual learners and their edX instructor can access (MIT's MOOCs are offered through edX).
Harbi said she was surprised -- not just by the fact that she was communicating with the real Walter Lewin, but also that she was doing well in the course. She takes medications for anxiety and depression, which she told Lewin makes it difficult for her to concentrate. Lewin, Harbi said, told her he would help her regain some self-confidence.
It would take almost a year before Harbi, with the help of MIT’s investigators, said she came to understand that Lewin’s interest in her was not motivated by empathy, and that their first conversations included inappropriate language. Shortly after contacting her, Harbi said, Lewin quickly moved their friendship into uncomfortable territory, and she was pushed to participate in online sexual role-playing and send naked pictures and videos of herself. After about 10 months, Harbi said, she resumed self-mutilating after seven years of not doing so.
The harassment, however, “started day one,” Harbi said. Eventually, she said she discovered she was one of many women, which MIT confirmed.
Harbi last October sent MIT a packet of more than 100 chat logs, emails, pictures, recordings and screenshots to document the harassment against her and other women. She gave Inside Higher Ed permission to view the contents on condition that they not be published and that names of the other women not be disclosed. The various pieces of evidence include nudity and sexually explicit language.
After reviewing the packet, MIT last month announced that an investigation had determined that Lewin, 78, had “engaged in online sexual harassment in violation of MIT policies.” The institution cut ties with Lewin, removing his online courses and lectures from MIT OpenCourseWare and its MOOC platform, MITx, and stripping him of his emeritus title.
Harbi was not named in the announcement -- her identity was disguised as a “learner in one of [Lewin’s] MITx courses” who last October provided “information about interactions between Lewin and other women online learners” -- nor did MIT provide any further details about the case. To confirm her identity, Harbi provided a copy of the letter addressed to her from MIT announcing the results of the investigation. She is now coming forward because she is concerned the case will be forgotten.
“If I as a victim stay anonymous, I will send a negative message to the other victims,” Harbi said in an interview with Inside Higher Ed. “If I hide, how can I ask other victims to come forward?”
'Unprecedented' Legal Area
The Lewin case lacks precedent in higher education, experts on sexual harassment said. As MOOCs exploded onto the higher education scene as recently as 2012, “The Year of the MOOC,” the case took place in largely unexplored legal territory.
MOOCs can enroll hundreds of thousands of people, and -- like any massive online arena -- they offer some sense of anonymity, which can enable harassment among learners on the message boards. Moreover, MOOCs such as Lewin’s have been marketed as access to the most brilliant minds in academe -- superstar professors whose decades of experience and prominence in their fields made them known quantities, not potential predators. 
“I would call it an unprecedented area,” said Erin Buzuvis, director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Studies at Western New England University. “There isn’t even a lot of precedent for online harassment in general.”
Sexual harassment of students in face-to-face courses is not unheard-of, however, said Billie Wright Dziech, a professor of English at the University of Cincinnati who explored the issue in the book The Lecherous Professor: Sexual Harassment on Campus, which she co-wrote.
“Many of the cases that I’ve dealt with or known about have been cases where the professor is very popular, very brilliant, very well-received by the academic profession, and that’s one of the reasons why they’re able to get away with a lot of what they do,” said Dziech, who specializes in research on sexual abuse and harassment. MOOCs, she added, could amplify that problem. “It seems to me that there are really serious legal hurdles for institutions that are using this technology.”
Whether MIT could be held liable for not protecting Harbi and the other women is still an unanswered question. MOOC providers differ on whether learners who are not enrolled at institutions eligible for federal financial aid are covered by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, which some researchers have warned about. But when it comes to discrimination, legal experts said, Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 should apply to anyone who registers for a MOOC.
“Title IX talks in terms of ‘no person’ shall experience discrimination -- not ‘no student,’ ” Buzuvis said. “That broad language creates the possibility for anyone who’s a victim of discrimination [to] potentially have a claim under Title IX.”
Buzuvis, who runs the Title IX Blog, said that, based on the severity of the Lewin case, a lawsuit against MIT could come down to if the institution knew about the harassment and didn’t act to protect learners.
Joel Robbins, a lawyer involved in a 2008 case where a student at Paradise Valley Community College overdosed on cocaine in a faculty member's home, interpreted the law similarly.
“It’s really going to depend on [Lewin] having shown his unsuitability for that job in the past,” Robbins said. “To put someone in a candy store and know they have a propensity for victimizing women ..., I think that’s where the crux of any issue is.”
An MIT spokeswoman said the university handled the case as though Harbi were enrolled at the institution. 
“As President [L. Rafael] Reif said, we believe we must take the greatest care that everyone who comes to us for knowledge and instruction, whether in classrooms or online, can count on MIT as a safe and respectful place to learn,” Provost Martin A. Schmidt said in an email. “Our actions did not depend on legal conclusions. They were guided by MIT policies with respect to teacher-learner interactions.”
As MIT pointed out, Lewin, 78, taught his last course on campus in spring 2008 and retired the next year. He has not taught online since his fall 2013 MOOC on classical mechanisms, during which he contacted Harbi. 
Inside Higher Ed was unable to contact Lewin or identify a lawyer for him. Many of his social media accounts have been closed, as has his email through the institution. Multiple emails -- one outlining the issues raised in this article -- that were sent to a personal account were not returned. Some web directories list a Walter Lewin in Cambridge, Mass., and Inside Higher Ed called and left several voicemails that were not returned. A Federal Express letter, which the company confirmed was delivered and signed for by someone with the last name Lewin, was sent to the address but received no response. Attempts to reach Lewin through publishers also proved unsuccessful.
The institution’s decision to remove Lewin’s courses from OpenCourseWare, a repository for free course content, was met with frustration from students not familiar with details of the case. MIT professors and administrators elaborated on the decision last week in independent campus newspaper The Tech, saying that not removing the courses “presented a [real] danger to people who would see them and contact [former] Professor Lewin, expecting a student-teacher relationship and getting something that was inappropriate.”
MIT has not been able to remove all trace of Lewin from the internet. The video lectures are still available through other sites that aggregate free course content.
Asked if he believed Lewin is still in communication with the women, Schmidt said “We do not know, but we have closed the communication channels through MIT.” He did not say if the case had been referred to law enforcement, as “disclosing more information regarding our actions would not be appropriate at this time.”
Balancing Privacy, Safety
After talking to a psychiatrist in September 2014 about what she described as a “breakdown,” Harbi decided to collect evidence of Lewin’s behavior to take to MIT. Within five days of searching, Harbi said, she found 10 other women whom Lewin had befriended and contacted on Facebook with inappropriate, sometimes identical messages. Lewin then blocked her from seeing his Facebook friends, she said.
Generally speaking, Harbi said, the women live in countries where speaking out about sexual harassment is taboo -- countries “where the culture is that it is better to actually not speak at all, because you’ll be a disgrace to your family.” Lewin confessed his love for several of them, chat logs show, but often denied those feelings to women who asked about the others.
Schmidt did not say how many women Lewin harassed, nor if any harassment took place while he taught on campus.
“In investigating the complaint and making that announcement, we attempted to balance our commitment to the privacy of the people involved with our commitment to ensuring safe learning environments,” he wrote. He later added that “MIT’s actions with respect to Dr. Lewin and the decision to describe some of those actions publicly were taken in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.”
What may be most difficult to understand, Harbi said, is why anyone would respond to Lewin’s requests. Harbi, who is originally from Algiers, Algeria, is open about having been sexually assaulted in the past, and said she struggles with abandonment issues. The more she tried to distance herself from Lewin, she said, the more he attempted to contact her through email and social media. Ultimately, Harbi said, she felt forced to “obey.”
“We all felt trapped,” Harbi said.
Dziech said Harbi’s history as a victim of sexual assault was relevant.
“That stays with you all of your life,” Dziech, who this quarter teaches a seminar on child and adolescent abuse, said. “You never get beyond it no matter how much therapy. It’s terrifying, and it raises another problem for all institutions: They can never know the background of the student -- in what way the student is vulnerable.”
MIT last spring surveyed its students about sexual assault, an initiative that drew praise from victims’ rights groups. More than one-third of the student body responded; 17 percent of female students and 5 percent of male students said they had experienced sexual assault. The numbers grew to 35 percent and 14 percent, respectively, when the students were asked about sexual harassment.
The survey was not motivated by the Lewin case, Schmidt said. “The survey was undertaken to understand the extent and effects of sexual misconduct in our community,” he wrote. “The chancellor had already conducted the survey and was already preparing to make the results public when the complaint about Dr. Lewin was received in October.”
Despite the growing calls to address sexual abuse in higher education, Dziech said, the issue of professor-student harassment remains largely unexplored.
“We have never in the academic profession -- never, never -- in a collective way looked at the threat posed by professors,” Dziech said. “We have never been willing to confront whatever is happening on campus.”

            MIT is indefinitely removing retired physics faculty member Walter Lewin’s online lectures from MIT OpenCourseWare and online MITx courses from edX, the online learning platform co-founded by MIT, following a determination that Dr. Lewin engaged in online sexual harassment in violation of MIT policies.MIT’s action comes in response to a complaint it received in October from a woman, who is an online MITx learner, claiming online sexual harassment by Lewin. She provided information about Lewin’s interactions with her, which began when she was a learner in one of his MITx courses, as well as information about interactions between Lewin and other women online learners.MIT immediately began an investigation, and as a precaution instructed Lewin not to contact any MIT students or online learners, either current or former.The investigation followed MIT protocol for complaints of sexual harassment. The head of the physics department, Professor Peter Fisher, ensured an objective and timely review, which included a review of detailed materials provided by the complainant and interviews of her and Lewin.Based on its investigation, MIT has determined that Lewin’s behavior toward the complainant violated the Institute’s policy on sexual harassment. Following broad consultation among faculty, MIT is indefinitely removing Lewin’s online courses, in the interest of preventing any further inappropriate behavior.MIT President L. Rafael Reif says, “Students place tremendous trust in their teachers. Deserving that trust is among our most fundamental obligations. We must take the greatest care that everyone who comes to us for knowledge and instruction, whether in classrooms or online, can count on MIT as a safe and respectful place to learn.”At the time MIT received the complaint, Lewin was not teaching any courses, either on campus or interactively online. Lewin retired from MIT in July 2009 and last taught a course on campus in spring 2008. He last taught an online MITx course in fall 2013.Provost Martin Schmidt says, “Dr. Lewin had a long and distinguished career at MIT, and it is painful to learn of the behavior that necessitated this action. However, complaints of harassment must be met immediately and squarely in all cases. Today’s decision was made in consultation with faculty leadership both in the physics department and across MIT more broadly.”The following information describes resources available to those who wish to discuss or report sexual misconduct at MIT.

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/13/suit-metro-state-denver-enabled-professor-retaliate-against-those-who-complained-he,"In an eyebrow-raising lawsuit filed last week against Metro State University in Denver, two professors say they were retaliated against for reporting a colleague’s alleged sexual indiscretion with … himself. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission granted the plaintiffs right-to-sue notices, but the implicated professor denies all claims against him. The university also denies the allegations and plans a vigorous defense.
The complaint was brought by Kamran Sahami, a professor of physics and former president of the university’s Faculty Senate, and Kristin Watson, a former non-tenure-track professor of communications and business. Watson alleges that she saw Gregory Black, chair of marketing, masturbating in his office in 2011 but didn’t report the incident to administrators for several years, in part because she was “shocked and traumatized,” and because she lacked tenure and feared for her job.
Black himself is not named as a defendant, but the suit against Metro State alleges a pattern of behavior on his part. The plaintiffs claim they were subjected to a sexually hostile work environment, in addition to retaliation.
Unbeknownst to Watson, another faculty member -- who is not named in the suit -- allegedly observed Black engaged in similar behavior in his office on multiple occasions. The professor reported Black to the university’s coordinator for sexual harassment and assault, as well as the dean of the College of Business, according to the complaint.
In 2014, Sahami, then president of the Senate, allegedly received a call from an anonymous student saying she, too, had seen Black masturbating in the marketing department. Sahami says he told the student that the issue was outside the scope of his responsibilities, and that she should report it to the business dean. The caller reportedly told him that she feared retaliation for any report, since it was rumored that another professor had been fired for complaining about Black’s alleged extracurricular activities.
Disturbed by the call, Sahami says, he reported it to Steven Jordan, university president. Sahami also allegedly looked into the claim that a faculty member had been terminated and eventually “deduced from information he was privy to about marketing faculty changes” who it was. He says he called the former faculty member and briefly spoke with her about her case and the student complaint.
Campaign of Retaliation
Following each of these incidents, Metro State -- either through Black or “at his behest” -- engaged in a campaign of retaliation, according to the suit. And in violation of its own policies, the university allegedly shared with Black the names of his accusers.
It was Metro State's “shocking lack of systemic [equal opportunity] protections that led directly to Black’s retaliatory activities,” the suit says.
First, the unnamed professor who had first reported Black was terminated, according to the suit, leading her to file a charge of discrimination and retaliation with the EEOC.
Around the same time, in 2013, Watson applied for a promotion to senior lecturer and a three-year contract. But she was removed from the list of senior candidates under Black’s direction, according to the complaint.
Later that year, Black allegedly adopted new student evaluation score standards and used them to find Watson’s performance deficient. He did not apply the same standards to Watson’s male colleagues, however, according to the complaint. Watson says Black then informed her that he was initiating a search for her replacement and “summarily” took her place on the marketing department search committee.
It was only then that she approached the university’s coordinator for Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits gender-based discrimination in education, according to the complaint, as she felt Black’s actions against her were linked to her having seen him masturbating.
Watson’s complaint blocked Black from removing her based on anything other than university-approved performance guidelines, the suit says. But he also began to “repeatedly interfere” with her ability to teach marketing courses. No details about that interference are included in the suit, and Watson could not immediately be reached for comment.
Black also allegedly blamed Watson’s lack of a marketing degree for her lack of advancement, but she says that male colleagues who also did not hold marketing degrees were not similarly held back. Black ultimately forced Watson out of a job by asking all non-tenure-track faculty members to reapply for their positions and using similar degree qualifications, according to the complaint, and by dividing the candidate pool in a way that allegedly severely disadvantaged Watson but advantaged other, less qualified candidates. She was not renewed in 2014.
Sahami, too, faced “aggressive action” once Black heard about his concerns, according to the complaint. Black allegedly filed a formal written grievance against Sahami and accused him of discrimination and harassment, saying he’d failed to be objective in his professional judgments about Black’s alleged behavior. But the allegation was “ludicrous,” the complaint says, “since Sahami had no relationship with Black.”
Turning the Tables
Each of these allegations related to Sahami bringing forward the complaint he received concerning Black’s sexual misconduct. Black wrote in his complaint, “I am left to conclude that the sole purpose of his actions was to aid in the EEOC complaint against me, and, thus, I submit this formal complaint of unprofessional behavior.”
Instead of dismissing Black’s complaint, however, Jordan, Metro State’s president, ordered an investigation into Sahami’s alleged lack of professionalism. The findings were referred to a Campus Ethics Committee, before which Sahami had a limited chance to present information and no ability to confront his accuser, according to the complaint. He says he had to hire a lawyer and expend considerable funds defending himself, and that Jordan ultimately issued him a letter of reprimand.
Meanwhile, the complaint says, “the university never actually investigated the underlying claims against Black -- and, upon information and belief, even as of 2017, had not subjected Black to any discipline as a result of his behavior in any of these incidents.”
Sahami did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Both he and Watson are seeking a trial by jury and unspecified damages.
Black in an email denied all allegations against him and referred additional questions to the university. Cathy Lucas, Metro State spokesperson, said in a statement that the university “denies the allegations contained in this complaint, and we assert there are many factual errors and statements in the claim. The university will dispute these allegations in court.”

http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F3/25/1052/572108/,"Kenneth N. Wexley appeals the district court's summary judgment disposition of his religious discrimination claims. We affirm the district court's April 19, 1993 determinations for the following reasons. Plaintiff-appellant Kenneth N. Wexley, a Jewish professor, was a tenured faculty member at Michigan State University's College of Business. Defendant-appellee Richard Lewis was the Dean of the College of Business, defendant-appellee David Scott was the University's Provost and Vice-President of Academic Affairs, defendant-appellee John DiBiaggio was the President of the University, and defendants-appellees Delores Cook and Dean Pridgeon were members of the University's Board of Trustees. On October 16, 1990, Dean Lewis recommended to Provost Scott that formal sexual harassment proceedings be initiated against Professor Wexley after four female students complained of his sexual advances. On October 22, 1990, Provost Scott notified President DiBiaggio of Dean Lewis' intent to initiate the dismissal proceedings before the University's Committee on Faculty Tenure (""UCFT"") in accordance with the University's Dismissal of Tenured Faculty for Cause Policy (""Dismissal Policy"") which provides that tenured faculty may be dismissed for ""gross misconduct."" On October 24, 1990, Provost Scott charged Professor Wexley with gross misconduct. On November 28, 1990, Professor Wexley and the Provost's designee met with the UCFT to select the Hearing Committee that would hear the evidence. Seven of the UCFT's fifteen faculty members were randomly selected by the UCFT's chairperson to serve on the committee. The Provost's designee used his sole peremptory challenge to dismiss the only Jewish member selected to sit on the Hearing Committee, Professor Martin Fox. The Provost claims that he dismissed Professor Fox due to his previously-shown unwillingness to recommend that tenured faculty be terminated; Professor Wexley insists that the Provost dismissed Professor Fox because he is Jewish. On September 11, 1991, the Hearing Committee issued its decision in which five of the six members found Professor Wexley guilty of gross misconduct and recommended that he be dismissed from the University.  Specifically, the Hearing Committee found: (1) [a] persistent pattern of intrusion into students' private affairs through the sexualization of conversations; (2) [a] denial of a student's right to pursue an education and work with faculty in an atmosphere of intellectual and academic freedom; and (3) [an] unreasonable use of his authority to take advantage of others in subordinate positions through sexual advances.... Hearing Committee's Preliminary Written Report and Decision at 11. After considering ""a wide range of penalties, including a warning letter, job transfer, last chance warning, counseling, removal of merit pay, suspension, suspension with conditions, and dismissal,"" id., the Hearing Committee recommended, by a five-to-one vote, that Professor Wexley be dismissed. Though the UCFT agreed, on appeal, with the Hearing Committee's finding of gross misconduct, the UCFT asked the Hearing Committee to reconsider its recommendation that Professor Wexley be discharged. Upon reconsideration, the Hearing Committee voted, once again, to dismiss Professor Wexley. On May 14, 1992, President DiBiaggio recommended to the University's Board of Trustees that Professor Wexley be suspended, without pay, for 18 months, and that he be required to submit to psychological counseling. On June 12, 1992, the University's Board of Trustees unanimously adopted President DiBiaggio's recommendations. Professor Wexley refused to accept the terms of the proposed suspension and submitted his resignation to President DiBiaggio on June 26, 1992. The University accepted the professor's resignation on July 23, 1992. Professor Wexley initiated this action claiming, inter alia, that he was discriminated against because he is Jewish. Specifically, Professor Wexley claims that he was dismissed: in violation of Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act (Count I); in violation of his equal protection and due process rights under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (Counts II and V); in violation of Michigan's Bullard-Plawecki Employee Right to Know Act (Count III); and, in violation of Michigan's ""constructive discharge"" laws (Count IV).  On June 2, 1992, the district court dismissed Professor Wexley's due process and equal protection claims with prejudice. On April 19, 1993, the district court granted the appellees' motion for summary judgment, dismissed Professor Wexley's civil rights claims, and remanded the Bullard-Plawecki and ""wrongful constructive discharge"" claims to state court. Professor Wexley timely appealed.  Summary judgment is appropriate where ""there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). A district court's grant of summary judgment is reviewed de novo. Pinney Dock  Transp. Co. v. Penn Cent. Corp., 838 F.2d 1445, 1472 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 880 (1988). In its review, this court must view the facts and all inferences drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. 60 Ivy St. Corp. v. Alexander, 822 F.2d 1432, 1435 (6th Cir. 1987). The moving party has the burden of conclusively establishing that no genuine issue of material fact exists. Id. However, in the face of a summary judgment motion, the nonmoving party cannot rest on its pleadings but must come forward with some probative evidence to support its claim. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 324 (1986). ""By its very terms, this standard provides that the mere existence of some alleged factual dispute between the parties will not defeat an otherwise properly supported motion for summary judgment; the requirement is that there be no genuine issue of material fact."" Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986) (emphasis in original). The dispute must be genuine and the facts must be such that if they were proven at trial, a reasonable jury could return a verdict for the nonmoving party. 60 Ivy St. Corp., 822 F.2d  at 1435. If the disputed evidence ""is merely colorable or is not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted."" Anderson, 477 U.S.  at 249-50 (citations omitted). Professor Wexley's Discrimination Claims A plaintiff presents a prima facie case of discrimination by showing that he belongs to a protected class, that he was qualified for the position that he held, that he was discharged from his employment, and that he was replaced by a non-minority worker.  McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 802 (1973). See generally Boutros v. Canton Regional Transit Auth., 997 F.2d 198, 202 (6th Cir. 1993) (""This Circuit has held that the required elements of prima facie proof necessary for a plaintiff charging a ... hostile work environment under both Title VII and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 are the same."") Moreover, "" ' [p]roof of discriminatory motive is critical' when disparate treatment is claimed."" Wilson v. Stroh Companies, Inc., 952 F.2d 942, 945 (6th Cir. 1992) (citation omitted). When a plaintiff presents a prima facie case of religious discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate non-discriminatory reasons for its actions. See Id. (""Once the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the defendant must articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for his action.""). ""If the defendant is successful, the plaintiff still may prevail if he establishes that the apparently non-discriminatory rationale was merely a pretext."" Id. (citation omitted). ""A plaintiff may show pretext by establishing that he did not violate the work rule for which he was disciplined or that other employees who engaged in similar misconduct received less severe sanctions."" Id. Professor Wexley was constructively discharged in accordance with the Hearing Committee's finding of ""gross misconduct"" which the University defines as ""violations of professional ethics, to wit: the use of professional authority to exploit others, e.g., sexual advances to a student."" Though Professor Wexley maintains that the appellees recommended his dismissal because he is Jewish, the professor failed to establish that the appellees treated similarly-situated non-Jewish faculty members more favorably. Accordingly, we need not determine whether Professor Wexley established a prima facie case of employment discrimination under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because the appellees articulated non-discriminatory non-pretextual reasons for their actions, and Professor Wexley failed to establish pretext. Therefore, the district court properly rejected Professor Wexley's 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim. In order to establish a prima facie case under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act, Professor Wexley ""must demonstrate that 1) he is a member of a protected class, 2) he was discharged, 3) the individual that discharged him was predisposed to discriminate against members of the protected class, and 4) the individual acted on this predisposition."" Wilson, 952 F.2d  at 946 (citation omitted). Once again, we need not determine whether Professor Wexley established a prima facie case under Elliott-Larsen because the appellees (pursuant to the burden-shifting framework) articulated legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for filing the ""gross misconduct"" charges and for pursuing the claims, and Professor Wexley failed to establish that the appellees' proffered reasons were pretextual.  Accordingly, the district court properly rejected Professor Wexley's Elliott-Larsen claim.  We AFFIRM the district court's April 19, 1993 determinations for the aforementioned reasons.

http://www.indystar.com/story/news/2016/09/20/michigan-state-fires-former-usa-gymnastics-doctor/90735722/,"Michigan State University announced Tuesday that it has fired Dr. Larry Nassar after an IndyStar investigation revealed accusations of sexual abuse against the longtime USA Gymnastics team physician.""Over the past week, the university received additional information that raised serious concerns about Nassar's compliance with certain employment requirements,"" university spokesman Jason Cody said. He would not elaborate but said the requirements were tied to a 2014 investigation into alleged ""abuse during a medical procedure.""Cody added the university learned during the recent investigation that Nassar ""was not forthcoming when questioned about other previous allegations."" Cody emphasized the firing was independent of an ongoing criminal investigation.Nassar's former attorney last week denied any wrongdoing by the doctor. His new attorney, Matthew Newburg, declined comment Tuesday.The IndyStar investigation uncovered allegations by two former gymnasts — one an Olympic medalist — that Nassar penetrated girls with his finger while treating them for hip and back pain. The former gymnasts came forward independently after IndyStar's Aug. 4 investigation of USA Gymnastics and its handling of sexual abuse complaints over decades.The women said they were molested during multiple treatments in the 1990s and early 2000s. They also claimed Nassar never used gloves and fondled their breasts.One of the women, Rachael Denhollander, of Louisville, Ky., filed a report Aug. 29 with Michigan State University police and a Title IX complaint with the university.""I am filled with relief that the silence is ending and the truth is being made known,"" Denhollander said Tuesday. ""I have hope that full justice is coming, and am firmly resolved to see that process through. This process has been painful beyond what I can express, but as justice is done, his ability to prey on women and children begins to end.""The other woman has sued Nassar and USA Gymnastics in California. The former Olympian was identified in court documents only as Jane Doe.A day after publication of IndyStar's story, a university spokesman said Nassar was the subject of a misconduct complaint filed in 2014 by a recent graduate. The complaint alleged ""abuse during a medical procedure."" The spokesman said the complaint was investigated and a police report was submitted to then-Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III, but Nassar was not charged with any crime.Ingham County Prosecutor Gretchen Whitmer said she has received ""a handful"" of allegations against Nassar since IndyStar's story.

                                            Spartan Marching Band Director and MSU professor John T. Madden will retire from the Spartan Marching Band and the university on Aug. 16, according to an email sent to members of the Spartan Marching Band.  
The email was sent by the Dean of the College of Music James Forger on June 16.

                                        
                

                        David Thornton, previously assistant director of bands and associate director of the Spartan Marching Band, was appointed as the new Spartan Marching Band director effective June 14. He will lead the band in the upcoming season.
Madden, who graduated from MSU’s College of Music in 1985, served as director for 28 years. During his tenure, Madden led the band in a Rose Bowl and two Cotton Bowl Classic games, in addition to countless other sporting events including the NCAA Tournament National Championship game in 2000 and 2009. 
Before he came to MSU to serve as director, Madden worked with Wichita State University Bands and briefly served as Associate Director of Bands and Director of the Marching Band at Rutgers University.  
He serves on the Michigan Chair of the College Band Directors National Association and the Big Ten Band Directors Association, among others.
He oversaw the MSU fight song's name change from “MSU Fight Song” to “Victory For MSU” in 2015.
In April 2016, MSU’s Office of Institutional Equity conducted an investigation and found Madden violated RVSM policy and sexually harassed a student in February 2016. Madden's disciplinary actions included: ""a one-week suspension from May 27 to June 3, 2016, where Madden was not allowed to be on campus or represent MSU in any capacity, a delay of his promotion to a full-time professor until Oct. 1, 2016 and a ban from the 2017 Huddle.""

https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/2021/01/28/michigan-state-university-msu-faculty-sexual-harassment-assault/4249555001/,"EAST LANSING — A Michigan State University veterinary medicine professor had a pattern of making sexual advances toward young women, university investigators determined.He used his status to gain trust, according to university records, then isolated the women for sexual advances. This professor, Matti Kiupel, is one of five faculty members who remain employed at MSU despite warnings or multiple reports of sexual misconduct. Kiupel did not respond for comment. A Lansing State Journal investigation into sexual misconduct at the university revealed at least 49 faculty and staff have been found in violation of policy since 2015. Offenses include making unwanted sexual contact, stalking or sexually harassing students or co-workers. At least 11 remain at or affiliated with the university. Those who remain or were allowed to leave on their own accord primarily are faculty, while the majority of the employees fired were staff.Nonconsensual sexual relationship: MSU fired a coach in February for a Title IX violation. He was initially granted retirementScott Westerman:Former MSU Alumni Association director was a mentor to her, then he made a sexual advanceIn 18 cases — all but two of which involved staff members — university officials fired the employee.Seven employees — only one of whom was staff — resigned or retired before the Office of Institutional Equity investigative or discipline process was complete. In those cases, investigations continued until a determination was made, but no discipline was imposed.Eight employees had retired or resigned before a complaint was filed against them. In two cases, retired professors lost their emeritus title as a result of the finding against them. The 49 Michigan State University employees who made unwanted sexual contact, stalked, sexually harassed or retaliated against students or co-workers are listed below. This list includes employees found to have violated MSU's Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct policy since 2015. This isn’t new. In September 2015, the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights determined that an “employee’s continued additional acts of harassment after the University failed to adequately address his behavior, led to a continuing hostile environment for a number of other employees.”In 2016, faculty physician Larry Nassar was accused of sexually abusing women and girls through his sports medicine practice over two decades, triggering a crisis still felt today. In a Jan. 15, 2021, email to MSU faculty, staff and students, President Samuel Stanley Jr. recalled the 204 women and girls who spoke out against Nassar in his 2018 sentencing hearings, saying they “challenge us to create culture change at MSU.”Stanley also wrote that the State Journal was investigating sexual misconduct complaints involving employees and acknowledged the results would show inequities in how cases were handled. “We [say this] not to excuse past decisions; rather, we want you to know the actions we have taken the past few years and continue to take will improve our consistency and accountability,” he wrote in the email, which also was signed by Provost Teresa Woodruff, Executive Vice President for Administration Melissa Woo and Executive Vice President for Health Sciences Norman Beauchamp. “Changes have been made, and more work will be completed soon to address inequalities in the disciplinary outcomes and further strengthen our disciplinary actions.” Independent review: 4 takeaways from a review of Michigan State University's Title IX policy and processFull coverage: Larry NassarConcerning, inappropriate behavior: MSU making new policies to crack down on inappropriate behavior skirting current rules9,000 Nassar records: MSU trustee finishes review of Nassar documents, says there are no new findingsStanley’s letter said the changes include plans to address inappropriate behavior that doesn’t rise to the level of a policy violation and revisions to university policies on travel, tenure discipline and dismissal, student-employee relationships and emeritus eligibility.""Much work has been done to change the culture of Michigan State University,"" MSU spokesperson Dan Olsen said in a statement. ""Culture change does not happen with one individual, it takes the whole system to work collectively to achieve the same goal of preventing inappropriate behavior and creating a culture where the behavior is not tolerated. There’s no mistake we have more work to do and the university is committed to that work.""At least five current faculty had multiple accusations of sexual misconductAt least 14 faculty or staff members who were found to have violated the university’s sexual misconduct policy had two or more people accuse them of sexual harassment or assault, according to a State Journal analysis. Of those, five remain at the university: criminal justice professor David Foran, marketing professor Tomas Hult, communications professor William Donohue, physiology professor Robert Wiseman and Matti Kiupel, professor of anatomic pathology in the College of Veterinary Medicine.Veterinary Medicine professor Matti KiupelIn August 2017, Kiupel was suspended for two months for unwelcome sexual contact and comments at a veterinary conference in December 2016. He also had to partake in one-on-one sexual misconduct training and was removed from his position as section head of anatomic pathology. Kiupel told the OIE he didn’t believe he engaged in any misconduct, but it ‘greatly saddens me that I made [redacted] feel uncomfortable. For this, I am truly sorry,’” according to the report. “[Kiupel] stated the complainant has caused him to undertake a great deal of self-reflection personally and professionally.” His conduct at the conference, investigators said, wasn’t severe and pervasive. But taken in totality with the history that was uncovered during the investigation, his conduct was. Investigators said he showed a pattern of pursuing women significantly younger than he was “through virtue of his employment, isolating them, and then making sexual advances.” “The striking power differential between [Kiupel] and claimant is compelling to the context of the conduct,” investigators wrote in the final report. “[Kiupel] exploited his status and influence in the profession as a basis to gain trust with a young student eager to be part of a selective specialty.” Three women told OIE during the investigation about unwanted or inappropriate sexual advances by Kiupel. Four other witnesses confirmed they had seen or heard of misconduct and said it was not unknown within the college. John Baker, then-dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine, told OIE it was “his understanding there had been complaints in the past [about Kiupel] before OIE was instituted” in 2015. Baker did not respond for comment. Investigators determined “[Kiupel’s] continued exposure to residents and any representation on behalf of and financed by MSU should be carefully and thoughtfully considered.” Communications professor William Donohue Donohue has been found responsible for sexual misconduct against women three times since 1994. A witness told OIE investigators Donohue’s name has come up as “an example of a problem at the University,” according to the report. Donohue did not respond for comment, but told OIE investigators he denied making the sexual comments or said they were taken out of context or misinterpreted. At a university dinner in April 2014, Donohue told sexually inappropriate jokes and stories that were “so severe it warranted an apology email from the Department Chair,” according to an OIE report. And yet, Donohue was appointed as the faculty grievance officer four months later, a post he held until 2018. A woman OIE interviewed described that as putting a “fox in charge of the hen house.” Donohue was reprimanded in 1994 for making inappropriate comments and for letting his hands linger on a woman’s neck and shoulders. In 2019, he was suspended for two months for two sustained complaints of forcible sexual contact and inappropriate sexual comments.Criminal justice professor David ForanIn 2016, OIE officials warned Foran of anonymous complaints about his behavior. The warning made “so little impression on [Foran]” that he didn’t remember if he hugged a student before dropping her off, according to an OIE report. Three years later, Foran was found to have violated MSU’s sexual misconduct policy for inappropriately touching and having overly personal communication with four students and for retaliatory behavior after students refused to attend social events.The investigation is complete. Foran remains on indefinite unpaid leave, which can be a step in the process of revoking tenure and dismissing faculty. The women told OIE investigators Foran hugged them, kissed them on the head and massaged their shoulders even as they tried to squirm away, according to the report. All four said they felt they had “no choice but to acquiesce and do what [Foran] wanted them to do” because if they did not, he would refuse to communicate with them and make their lives more difficult. Foran told the State Journal he was shocked when he found out several of his students were uncomfortable with some of his behavior. He said he “felt awful about it, but took full responsibility, apologized fully and sincerely, and immediately changed my behavior.” “While I again take full responsibility for my actions, I have never made sexual suggestions, allusions, advances or propositioned a student, I have never used sexually explicit, lewd or vulgar language to or in reference to a student, I have never groped or otherwise sexually touched or interacted with a student, I have never been violent with a student, and I have not been accused, by anyone, of doing any of those,” Foran wrote in an email.Marketing professor Tomas HultWhen Sarah Singer, director of Education Abroad, filed a harassment report in 2019 against Hult, then-director of the International Business Center, she was at least the third person to bring Hult's behavior to the university’s attention. In 2012 and 2017, a marketing professor and an Academy of International Business employee reported sexual misconduct by Hult in their exit interviews. Olsen said he could not confirm or deny the 2012 report. The 2017 complaint made its way to OIE, but investigators found Hult had not violated university policy. Full story: Michigan State administrator suspended after sexual misconduct accusationSinger’s complaint of unwanted and inappropriate touching and sexual comments was not substantiated in July 2019. Hult was suspended from his position as director of the university’s International Business Center for 12 weeks in September 2019. He remained an active faculty member.Singer’s case later was reopened, and material from other reports was used for additional context. With the additional material, Hult was found to have violated the sexual misconduct policy. His endowed chair position was revoked in January, Olsen said. The woman from the 2012 complaint, a marketing professor who did not have tenure at the time, is no longer at the university. “When you don’t have any kind of power, the system doesn’t seem to support you,” she said. “You’re kind of all alone...It’s an impossible situation to be in.” Brian Koncius, Hult’s attorney, wrote in an email there was no basis to reopen Singer’s complaint and said there was nothing that could “reasonably have led anyone to change the proper original findings.” Bringing in statements from other reports “defies logic,” Koncius said. “That investigation questioned the individuals who were actually present in the (sic) Dr. Hult and Dr. Singer’s workplace and who routinely witnessed their interactions - proper witnesses,” Koncius wrote. “Those witnesses were consistent, each stating that they did not witness or feel subjected to actions that they believed were sexual harassment: ‘none of the 15 witnesses [recalled] a single instance of [Dr. Hult] making a comment of a sexual nature.’”Physiology professor Robert WisemanWiseman was suspended for six weeks after OIE investigators found he had sexually harassed six women over nearly two decades. In all, nine women said Wiseman made inappropriate and sexually charged comments or jokes that made them feel uncomfortable. One told investigators she had “no doubt [Wiseman] will try to undermine my ability to do what I do ... He is disgusting and manipulative. I view him as dangerous, bullish and as a threat. He uses his status to do what he does.” Full story: Report: MSU physiology professor sexually harassed at least 6 women over 17-year periodAfter OIE’s first finding, other people came forward with “insane accusations,” David Nacht, Wiseman’s attorney, said. The second complaint was not sustained, Nacht said, and Wiseman has had no other complaints in the past two decades. Nacht said the initial investigation into Wiseman was “flawed and deeply biased.” Investigators did not let him answer questions and did not notify him of the accusations prior to his interview, Nacht said. Nacht said because the complaint came in a post-Nassar time at MSU when the university was cracking down on sexual misconduct, it was “not the time when there was going to be a reversal” after an appeal. “[Wiseman] is an incredibly well-respected guy,” Nacht said. “He’s trying to cure diabetes, and now he’s been reduced to this inappropriate comment and that inappropriate comment.”Keeping their honorary titlesFour retired professors and administrators were allowed to keep their honorary “emeritus” titles despite being found to have violated policies on sexual misconduct by OIE investigators.James Kielbaso and Thomas Vogel had emeritus standing prior to the OIE reports being made. Charles Steinfield and William Latta were awarded the title several years after they were punished for sexual misconduct. MSU spokesperson Olsen said prior to June 2019, all faculty, academic staff and executive managers automatically received emeritus status upon their retirement. Latta, an emeritus assistant vice president for operations, could not be reached for comment. In lieu of commenting, Kielbaso, a professor emeritus in the Department of Forestry, sent a photo of a note written by the woman who says he sexually harassed her. The note says, “Thank you so much for believing in me and all you have done for me in the past. You’ve been a great help personally and professionally.”  Kielbaso said this note was from “well after graduation and into a full time job and successful career.”History professor Harold Marcus: Lawsuit: Late MSU professor treated university as his 'own sexual playground'Physiology professor Robert Pittman: Former MSU professor now realizes sexual encounter in '99 wasn't consensual, pleads guiltyComing forward: More men are reporting sexual assault, harassment to Michigan State UniversityThe university is currently in the process of revoking the honor from Vogel, a professor emeritus in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, and Steinfield, a professor emeritus in the Department of Media and Information, as a part of a university-wide review, Olsen said. This review will be completed and sent to the provost no later than June 1, he said. Three women told OIE investigators Steinfield had touched their buttocks, lower back and upper thigh. Two of them described his touch as “cupping” and all three said it was not subtle.Steinfield told the State Journal he had doubts in 2012 about the fairness of the investigation, and suffered “heavy consequences” to his career, income and reputation. Even so, he said, he expressed regret to the complainants that his actions caused discomfort. “These allegations were a shock to me as my recollections of the events in question did not match those of the complainants,” Steinfield said. Over the course of a year and a half, in 2009 and 2010, Steinfield, who was then the chair of the Department of Telecommunication, Information Studies and Media, greeted one of the women with touches on the small of her back and her arms, according to the OIE report. During a meeting in his office, Steinfield put his hand on her buttocks and rubbed up and down for five seconds as he continued the conversation.Another woman reported that around 2010, Steinfield would hug her sideways around the waist when they were alone and would rub his body against hers. She estimated that happened about four dozen times.When she confided in a colleague, they told her, “oh yeah he does that” and “what are you going to do? He’s the chair.”Julie Libarkin, a professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, has documented more than 1,000 cases of sexual misconduct at hundreds of universities across the U.S. in a database she created. Libarkin was “dry humped” by Vogel at a retirement party in 2010, an OIE investigation found. Her 2016 complaint was sustained, but Vogel still holds his emeritus title. Vogel said the OIE procedures used in 2017 were ruled to be unfair and he was not awarded proper due process during the investigation. He said there were no witnesses and he treated the women he worked with respectfully. “Unfortunately for me (and others who have been investigated recently by the OIE) Ms. Libarkin’s complaint came soon after the Larry Nassar disaster at Michigan State University,” Vogel wrote in an email. “This Office was under a lot of pressure to be aggressive because of the way the Nassar case was mishandled. In their subsequent investigations they had no sympathy at all for the accused, even though, in many cases, there was a lack of evidence.” Libarkin said she knew her experience couldn’t be unique, so she began tracking sexual misconduct at universities across the country. “At first it just was an advocacy project, but then I realized it was a very interesting dataset that no one else had collected,” Libarkin said. “Even though it’s very incomplete because it’s only public cases, the data begins to point toward truisms and common themes about cases.” History professorHarold Marcus, who was found to have sexually harassed and assaulted two students in the '70s and '80s, was stripped of his emeritus title in 2019 after review by the university. Marcus died in 2003. Physiology professor Robert Pittman also was stripped of the title last year before he was sentenced for fourth-degree criminal sexual conduct for the assault of a man he supervised. Allowed to retire, quietly move onSeveral employees found to have violated the university’s sexual misconduct policy were allowed to quietly resign or retire. For several others, their temporary appointment ended, Olsen said. MSU paid former university registrar Nicole Rovig more than $70,000 for 90 days of transitional support and vacation payouts when she resigned less than a month after OIE determined she had sexually assaulted Lisa Zastrow, who worked under Rovig. Rovig could not be located for comment. Zastrow said she told the union that represented her about the assault. She said she was ready to accept that Rovig was drunk, and leave it at that. But Rovig felt differently, she said, and fired Zastrow without telling her why. “This is not an isolated incident with just me,” Zastrow said. “The bottom line is, what they did to me was ridiculously unfair.” Zastrow ended up settling with the university for about $90,000 after filing a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission about being fired.Appeal denied: Appeals court rejects bid by William Strampel to have misconduct conviction set asideWilliam Jacoby: MSU political scientist tried to trade academic guidance for sex, university findsPolitical science professor William Jacoby and the former dean of MSU’s College of Osteopathic Medicine, William Strampel, along with four others, were allowed to retire either before their OIE investigation finished or before discipline was imposed. This allowed them to keep some retirement benefits, like health care or life insurance.Jacoby, who formerly was an eminent figure in his field, propositioned a graduate student “for sexual favors in exchange for his academic guidance regarding her research and paper,” according to an OIE report. Jacoby did not respond for comment. Experts suggest possible solutionsIt’s easier to discover what doesn’t work to address sexual misconduct on campus than it is to find what does work, said Christina DeJong, a MSU criminal justice professor who has studied sexual misconduct by professors. Doing nothing or forcing someone to retire early, especially, are not helpful. DeJong said she has heard stories of universities that don’t take action because the conduct isn’t criminal or egregious enough.DeJong pointed to Strampel, who spent eight months in jail after a jury convicted him of using his power as dean to proposition and control female medical students. Several female medical students and graduates testified that he made sexually inappropriate comments to them and propositioned them for sexual favors. Administrators spoke to Strampel about complaints of inappropriate sexual comments and behavior during performance reviews in 2005, 2010 and 2015. No action was taken.Strampel stepped down as dean in December 2017, citing medical reasons, but retained a tenured professorship. At this point, Strampel was under fire for not ensuring Nassar was following protocols put into place after a 2014 sexual assault complaint. Instead of finishing a lengthy tenure revocation so the university could fire Strampel, officials negotiated a retirement deal in 2018: Strampel would not receive emeritus status and would forfeit other benefits related to executive level retirement, but would receive basic retiree health care coverage. “[Strampel] was allowed to offend and offend and offend, and nothing ever happened until it reached the level of criminal,” DeJong said. “There were years of people making complaints about him...and he was allowed consistently to offend in a very powerful position. Why he was allowed to remain dean under some of these accusations, I have no idea.” Institutional tolerance for the behavior is one of the common themes in conversations about sexual violence in the workplace, said Sheerine Alemzadeh, co-founder and co-director of Healing to Action, a Chicago-based nonprofit that works to address gender-based violence.“Rather than looking at if the [punishment] is enough to stop them from doing it again, it’s important to look at the culture of the workplace to see what’s going on that makes them feel emboldened to do this,” Alemzadeh said. In academia, Alemzadeh said, people are vulnerable if they have not received tenure or if they are doctoral students working under the mentorship of one faculty member. That means universities need to make sure policies are easily understood and to ensure faculty and staff know the harm they may be causing with their behavior, she said. “The culture of tolerance can create a real liability for the employer over time,” Alemzadeh said. “If the culture is there, you will see patterns of repeated incidents, maybe by multiple people against multiple people...This basically stops people’s careers in their tracks.”About this report: To complete this investigation, the Lansing State Journal made 25 public records requests to Michigan State University over an 18-month period.

                                            Two retired emeritus professors at Michigan State University who were previously found to have violated policies on sexual misconduct have had their honorary titles removed.
According to an investigation conducted by the Lansing State Journal, Thomas Vogel, a former professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, and Charles Steinfield, a former professor in the Department of Media and Information, were stripped of their emeritus titles following a recommendation by the university committee on faculty affairs. 

                                        
                

                        Both revocations were then approved by President Samuel Stanley. All findings written in the investigation were confirmed by MSU Deputy Spokesperson Dan Olsen in January.
“While these revocations may not undo the harm caused by these two individuals, our actions make clear that even retired faculty can and will be held accountable for violating university policy while at Michigan State University when new evidence is brought forward,” Olsen said in a statement. 
A previous investigation by the LSJ found that Vogel and Steinfield were among at least four retired professors that were allowed to keep their emeritus status despite their transgressions. Vogel held emeritus status prior to being found in violation of sexual misconduct policies by the Office of Institutional Equity, while Steinfield was given the emeritus title several years after being punished for sexual misconduct. 
According to the LSJ investigation, two other professors emeritus also were found in violation of these policies: James Kielbaso, a professor emeritus in the Department of Forestry, and William Latta, an emeritus assistant vice president for operations. Both still retain their titles.
Before June 2019, faculty and academic staff received emeritus titles automatically upon retirement.
Steinfield was informed in February that the university was considering the revocation of his professor emeritus status. Vogel was informed in March. 

                        
    


                                                                            In letters to both men dated May 5, 2021, Provost Teresa Woodruff said that “...the matter is of sufficient seriousness to warrant the revocation of your Professor Emeritus status.” 
Woodruff said that the emeritus status had been revoked pursuant to the emeritus policy in the faculty handbook, which states that emeritus status may be revoked in circumstances in which behavior occurring or discovered after one is awarded emeritus status is deemed to be “substantially inconsistent with the behavior expected of Michigan State University faculty, academic staff, and administrative staff.”
The ability of the Provost to the President to recommend revocation of emeritus title, after approval by the University Committee for Faculty Affairs, was added to the emeritus policy in February 2020. This is the policy Woodruff used in her letters to Vogel and Steinfield. 
This revision was included in a letter sent out from President Stanley and other administrators in January of this year. The letter, sent to MSU faculty, staff, and students, described actions taken over the last three years to prevent instances of relationship violence and sexual misconduct from happening.

That investigation cleared Nassar of sexual misconduct, but Strampel and Nassar then agreed on protocols to be put in place once Nassar returned to clinical duties.Strampel's attorney has said it was the responsibility of the Title IX investigator, not Strampel, to ensure compliance with those protocols.Related: MSU let Larry Nassar see patients for 16 months during criminal sex assault investigationThe Lansing State Journal reported in December that MSU let Nassar see patients for 16 months after Nassar was cleared by Title IX investigators in 2014 but while he was still under criminal investigation.More: Timeline: Who is Larry Nassar?Controversial coach: A timeline of John Geddert's career in gymnasticsMSU hid full conclusions of 2014 Nassar report from victimWhat consequences could Strampel face?Strampel, also the target of numerous pending civil lawsuits related to Nassar's conduct at MSU, faces a maximum five-year prison sentence on a felony misconduct in office charge.

   A former dean at Michigan State University who oversaw Larry Nassar was found guilty of multiple criminal charges on Wednesday, including over his handling of sexual abuse allegations against the convicted sports doctor.   A jury convicted William Strampel, who was head of the College of Osteopathic Medicine, on two counts of willful neglect of duty and one count of felony misconduct in office over sexual comments he made to female students when they came to him for help with their careers. But the 71-year-old was cleared of felony second-degree criminal sexual conduct.   He faces a maximum of five years in prison.   
   Strampel served as dean for more than a decade. He initially stepped down for medical reasons before being fired in 2018 in the wake of the Nassar scandal.    Nassar, who worked for MSU and USA Gymnastics, was convicted of sexually assaulting patients under the guise of medical treatment for decades. During his sentencing, hundreds of women and girls came forward to say that they had been abused by the doctor.   
   

   On Wednesday, after more than five hours of deliberation, jurors found that Strampel failed to properly oversee Nassar. He had been responsible for ensuring Nassar abided by certain protocols after MSU launched an investigation of the sports doctor in 2014.    They also found that a laundry list of sexual comments Strampel made to female students was criminal and agreed with the prosecutor that Strampel used his position as dean to attempt to get sexual favors.    Several women testified that they had gone to Strampel to arrange to retake tests or to address concerns about their future at the college. They said during their separate meetings with Strampel that he made sexually laden comments, including, ""If you tell anybody that I made this exception for you, I'll tell people that we're having sex and ruin your reputation"" and ""You would look sexy driving that sports car.""   
   The sexual conduct charge was a part of that. A former student, Jessica Neuroth, testified that Strampel grabbed her buttocks while at a scholarship dinner in 2014. A key issue at trial was whether Strampel had a ""corrupt intent.""   
   

   Michigan Assistant Attorney General Danielle Hagaman-Clark, who led the case against Strampel, argued during her opening statement and closing arguments that he maintained a powerful position at MSU and held the future of these women in his hands. She said Strampel fully comprehended the weight of sexually harassing statements such as ""How many of your classmates are virgins?"" and ""I own you.""   ""Absolute power corrupts absolutely,"" Hagaman-Clark told the jury.   Strampel's attorney, John Dakmak, countered that any comments that Strampel made were ""locker room talk."" A former colleague of Strampel's, William Falls, testified that Strampel was indiscriminate in making sexually inappropriate comments; he said them to men, women and groups.   ""I know there were other members of the dean's staff who were going to talk to him about it,"" Falls said. ""There was also evaluations or surveys that were being done that we did make comments about that language and how it could be detrimental to the college.""   Dakmak used that testimony to try to show that Strampel had ""a sailor's mouth"" but argued that it wasn't enough for any sort of criminal or corrupt intent. ""The corruption is not there,"" Dakmak said during his closing argument. ""Don't take shock and awe and boggle that up with criminal intent. With criminality.""   Hagaman-Clark agreed that ""locker room talk"" would not be enough to convict Strampel had the comments been made at a bar. But she noted that the comments were uttered in an academic setting between a dean of the college and women who believed he was ""standing between them and their dream of becoming a doctor.""   
   ""Should these women have to listen to this sexually inappropriate language? And this sexual innuendo?"" Hagaman-Clark asked in her rebuttal. ""They all felt threatened by it. Why? Why should they have to listen to that? They're simply trying to become doctors.""

https://apnews.com/article/7d1ea5bfbcf540e1aaef110dbc2b9cc6,"
                                        Minot State University and the U.S. Department of Education have reached a settlement following a years-long Title IX investigation that concluded the school failed to process a complaint by a then-student who reported a professor had sexually assaulted her for over two years.The federal agency’s Office for Civil Rights announced the settlement Thursday. Under the terms of the agreement, the university has agreed to offer and pay for counseling and other remedies for the woman to address any psychological, academic or employment issues she faced as a result of the school’s delay in processing her complaint.The university came under scrutiny after the woman, who was not identified, filed a complaint with the agency in December 2013 alleging the school had discriminated against her on the basis of sex. The agency summarized the findings of its investigation in a 38-page letter addressed to Steven Shirley, the university’s president.
    

The letter states that the student told the school about “numerous alleged instances of sexual harassment and sexual assault that began in June 2010 and continued through December 2012.” It also explains that the professor had implied to woman that without his assistance she “would be unable to achieve her professional goals.” The woman also said that the professor and others on his behalf had sent her text messages and emails “to discourage her from pursuing any complaint against him.”

The letter does not address whether the professor was investigated by authorities or criminally charged. The agency found no evidence that the university interviewed the professor, faculty or students about the student’s allegations. It also says that the university did not adjudicate the student’s allegation through hearing procedures, as required by the university’s policies. Instead, when the professor resigned in August 2013, the university halted its investigation.
The agency found that MSU “failed to respond promptly and equitably to student complaints of sexual harassment and sexual assault, including by failing to determine whether the students were subjected to a hostile environment,” according to the letter. The agency also found that the school had no designated Title IX coordinator as required by law.Title IX prohibits gender discrimination at schools that receive federal funds. It is the same law that guarantees girls equal access to sports, but it also regulates institutions’ handling of sexual violence and increasingly is being used by victims who say their schools failed to protect them.During the investigation, the federal agency reviewed files related to reports of sexual harassment and sexual assault for four academic years, visited the university, and interviewed the complainant, students and university staff. The student who prompted the investigation reported her sexual assault to the school in April 2013.
    

As part of the settlement, the university has also agreed to develop a procedure to document each incident or complaint of discrimination on the basis of sex — including sexual assault and sexual harassment — that it receives. It also must submit to the agency copies of all grievances it receives during the 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 academic years that allege sexual assault and sexual harassment.The school on Thursday said it has already established a Title IX office and appointed its full-time coordinator, created and offered Title IX training programs and developed a notice of nondiscrimination.“MSU has cooperated fully with the Office of Civil Rights, and through this process the campus has implemented a number of new programs and initiatives to ensure the safest and best teaching and learning atmosphere possible for all of our students, faculty, and staff,” Shirley said in a statement.

                                An investigation by Montana State University into allegations
against MSU Orchestra conductor Shuichi Komiyama has concluded that
he had an intimate relationship with a female student and violated
university policies against sexual harassment and gender
discrimination.
Komiyama, 47, a charismatic conductor credited with breathing
new life into MSU's orchestra and jazz programs, has denied all the
allegations.
The investigation concluded the female student had a reasonable
belief that the professor had ""considerable power over her success""
and that she had to give in to his sexual advances to receive his
assistance in furthering her career, receiving special instruction
and getting into graduate school.
The investigative report says the student alleged that Komiyama,
47, insisted on a sex act in his MSU office. She further alleged
that, after she tried to end the affair, he once forced her to have
sexual intercourse.
Komiyama denied ever having sexual contact of any kind with the
student, the report said. MSU identified the student throughout the
report as Student A.
The report also says that other female students accused Komiyama
of making sexual advances toward them, and investigators concluded,
""there is a preponderance of evidence supporting these allegations,
further supporting the allegations of Student A.""
The Chronicle obtained this week a copy of MSU's 18-page
investigative report into Student A's allegations from her
attorney, Geoffrey Angel of the Angel Law Firm in Bozeman. Angel
said he hopes other witnesses will come forward as a result of the
report becoming public, but he declined further comment.
Sections of the report were blacked out by MSU to protect
several students' privacy and some words were blacked out by Angel
to protect his client's identity.
Komiyama's attorney, Chuck Watson of Bozeman, said the assistant
professor of music ""continues to deny"" the allegations that he
sexually harassed the student, violated MSU's discrimination policy
or ever forced her to have sex.
""I think it's sad this matter is being treated opportunistically
by a former student,"" Watson said. ""I think this is probably a case
of hurt feelings that unfortunately is being turned into something
else. These are complicated relationships, particularly in the
arts.""
Watson said that in his 20 years representing defendants in
Bozeman, ""I have never been approached ... by as many people with
favorable opinions of my client,"" and many had commended him for
defending Komiyama.
Leslie Taylor, MSU legal counsel, said the university believes
this is a confidential employee matter, and the university cannot
release any information, except that Komiyama ""remains on
suspension.""
The Chronicle and the Montana Newspaper Association sued MSU in
June seeking disclosure of documents to explain why Komiyama was
placed on paid leave, arguing that the public's right to know
outweighed the right to privacy of a person in a position of public
trust. MSU is opposing the Chronicle's request, arguing that the
documents concern employees and students who have a reasonable
expectation of privacy. The case is pending in Gallatin County
District Court.
Taylor would not comment on whether MSU has taken any actions
since the investigative report. She would not discuss whether MSU
has held any hearings before a committee of faculty, one of the
steps spelled out under the Board of Regents policy for terminating
a tenured professor. Among the reasons that a tenured professor can
be terminated are willfully concealing a felony or crime of moral
turpitude when seeking employment, or unethical exploitation of
students.
Komiyama pleaded guilty in California when he was 25 to a felony
for having a sexual relationship with a high school girl nine years
younger, starting when she was 14. MSU was not aware of that
conviction. The university only extended background checks to all
prospective employees, including faculty, beginning in 2010. Since
the Chronicle reported the conviction, Komiyama has registered as a
sex offender, as required by Montana law.
MSU put Komiyama on paid leave in April after the student's
allegations first surfaced. Komiyama, a tenured assistant
professor, is earning $53,737 a year.
Greg Young, interim director of the MSU School of Music, said
Friday he has been given the go-ahead to replace Komiyama for one
year. He has hired Eric Funk to rehearse the orchestra, and he will
bring in guest conductors for performances. Ryan Matzinger will
lead the MSU Jazz Band.
According to MSU's investigative report, female Student A told
the head of the music department on April 8 that she had had a
sexual relationship with Komiyama.
Three days later, Komiyama was placed on paid leave, as required
by the regents' policy. On April 14, MSU President Waded Cruzado
directed Diane Letendre, MSU interim affirmative action director,
to investigate.
Letendre and Beth Merrell, MSU associate legal counsel,
interviewed 16 male and female students, including student
assistant conductors, witnesses, students who made complaints or
requested interviews, and former students. They interviewed
Komiyama with his attorney, seven MSU staff and faculty members,
three members of the public, one parent and people suggested by
Komiyama.
The investigators concluded that on the major allegation that
there was a sexual relationship, ""Student A's statements are more
credible than Professor Komiyama's,"" based on the preponderance of
the evidence, including witness statements, emails and the
professor's changing stories when confronted with evidence.
The investigators wrote there was not enough evidence to
conclude sexual acts were physically coerced, but that Student A
did feel pressured to stay in Komiyama's good graces.
They concluded that Komiyama ""implicitly and explicitly
conditioned his help with her musical career on sexual favors from
her."" That constitutes a ""quid pro quo"" form of sexual harassment
under the U.S. Education Department's Office of Civil Rights
guidelines.
Whether a student resists a teacher's advances and suffers harm,
or gives in, the Office of Civil Rights says, ""the student has been
treated differently, or the student's ability to ... benefit from
the school's program has been denied or limited, on the basis of
sex."" That violates Title 9, the federal law outlawing
discrimination in education on the basis of gender, and MSU's
sexual harassment policy.
The investigators concluded that ""Professor Komiyama's conduct
constitutes serious and pervasive conduct of a sexual nature that
created a hostile educational environment.""
The report also ""concluded Professor Komiyama did not maintain
appropriate boundaries with students and blurred the lines between
mentor, friend and professor.""
According to MSU's investigative report:
In 2008, Student A met Komiyama, had long conversations about
her ambitions, and became part of a sort of club of students who
hung out at his house. There was eating and drinking, and while she
and some students were over 21, ""it was common for students to get
drunk and for underage students to drink."" While Komiyama denied
supplying alcohol to underage students, investigators found that
the professor hosted social gatherings with students and that
underage drinking did occur at some of those events.
In 2009, Student A witnessed what happened to a male student who
fell out of favor with Komiyama. The young man was kicked out of
the orchestra, made fun of by the professor and students, and
treated ""horribly,"" she said.
Although Komiyama denied treating the student badly, ""the
preponderance of the evidence supports the fact that Student B was
ostracized by Professor Komiyama, which could reasonably cause
concern to other students dependent on Professor Komiyama's help in
their education,"" the report said.
In 2010, Student A traveled to Hawaii with the MSU Jazz Band,
which performed on a cruise ship and held music workshops for
school children. She said there was considerable drinking in
Komiyama's room, and she once found him in boxer shorts and a
T-shirt in his cabin alone with a female student, identified in the
report as Student C, who confirmed the report to investigators.
Student A and other students went on a camping retreat with
Komiyama and his wife on the Madison River, where there was
considerable drinking and sexual talk.
Student A said she believed the professor was ""manipulating her
by pitting her against Student C"" and ""felt if she didn't do
everything necessary to please Professor Komiyama, he would shift
his attention"" to another student.
An intimate relationship began at the Montana Music Educators
Conference in Missoula in October 2010. After the conference,
students went to Komiyama's hotel room, where Student A said she
and he were ""cuddling"" and touching on his bed. The professor
denied cuddling, but other students witnessed it; some thought
Student A instigated it. Three female students spent the night in
his room to save money.
The following Saturday, Komiyama invited Student A to his home
for dinner while his wife was out of town. They watched videos on
his bed, cuddled and ""spooned."" The next evening, they kissed,
removed clothing and touched. She said she went along ""because she
worried about what he would do if she rejected him.""
For several weeks, they went out on ""dates"" and were alone in
his office ""where they drank and kissed and he insisted that she
perform oral sex on him."" He told her ""all good women (musicians)
do this; it's just part of the music business.""
She said last November he told her he loved her and wanted her
to say the same. Her boyfriend overheard some of the conversation,
prompting their breakup. The boyfriend confronted Komiyama, who
denied the relationship and said that Student A was ""obsessed"" with
him.
On Nov. 7 or 8, Student A alleged Komiyama came to her apartment
at night, brought alcohol, and she got very drunk. He then took off
her clothes and had sexual intercourse with her. ""She stated she
was crying and saying ‘No' while it was happening,"" according to
the report. He denied it ever happened.
After that, Student A said she tried to avoid physical contact.
Nevertheless, Komiyama took her to a hotel and gave her a
medallion, which he described as one of his most prized
possessions, and a diamond ring, to show he loved her. She refused
to stay at the hotel with him.
After this rejection, he emailed her several times a day,
alternately berating and wooing her, spread rumors about her,
insisted she take lessons from him, and said, ""if she did not do
what he said, she would not get into graduate school. He told her
that if anyone found out about their relationship, he would deny it
and say she was an obsessed student,"" the report said.
Last spring, she returned the medallion. He provided
considerable help to her in applying to graduate schools.
Student A alleged Komiyama went to bars and restaurants alone
with Student C, that Student C said he had kissed her, and that
Student A once saw a text message to Student C that said something
like, ""Oh baby, watching porn.""
Student A told investigators she came forward because ""she
wanted to assure that no other student had to experience this
conduct from Professor Komiyama.""
She turned over to investigators 42 email messages from Komiyama
from December 2010 through February. They include: ""just in case
your phone isn't working ... I love you ... call me later TONIGHT!""
and ""More and more we talk, I feel your trust and love. (make sure
your mom don't read this stuff) Good nite Love.""
On Dec. 30, his email said: ""I'm sick and I need to fix myself
cause this is not me and it's not your fault, love.""
And on Jan. 1, his email said: ""Alright so you're angry, don't
love me anymore ... ok I got it ... but here's the reality ... grad
school... career ... and decide quickly....""
He emailed that he was working every day with Student C to
improve her skills.
In February he emailed Student A asking for the medallion back
and saying she could sell or keep the ring. ""I don't hate you ... I
just feel sorry for you.""
In Komiyama's interview with investigators, he alleged Student A
had a bad reputation and a serious drug problem with cocaine and
prescription drugs. No other witnesses accused her of having a drug
problem. The investigators concluded the weight of the evidence did
not support his allegation.
Komiyama said his messages about wanting to meet her were only
about music lessons, and that the music group was like a family and
he used the word ""love"" in that way.
Komiyama admitted having a picture of Student A on his cellphone
background. When investigators visited his office, they found a
photo displayed of him with Student A. The only other photos were
of ""groups of younger students"" at music events. (Komiyama had also
worked with high school students in the Billings Youth
Orchestra.)
Several MSU students interviewed stated they drank with Komiyama
in his MSU office after concerts. (MSU's policy allows alcohol in
student living quarters if students are of legal age and in areas
and at events approved by the president, but prohibits alcohol in
all other cases.)
Student C told investigators Student A confided to her that
Student A and Komiyama were having a sexual relationship. Student C
said she also felt Komiyama was pitting her against Student A. He
confided in her that he was in love with Student A and that the
whole thing had ""broken his heart.""
Student D told investigators Komiyama told her he was having sex
with Student A, but a few days later Komiyama retracted the
statement.
Several witnesses said they saw students alone with the
professor and that his office door window was sometimes
covered.
Some said Student A was flirtatious, wore suggestive clothes and
appeared happy about her relationship with the professor.
Faculty witnesses said they saw underage drinking at Komiyama's
home. Some faculty members said he was more involved with students'
futures than is normal. All faculty said they observed that he
""failed to maintain appropriate boundaries in his relationships
with students"" with frequent socializing and drinking. One faculty
member who attended the gatherings stopped because of such
concerns.
One faculty member said he had worried about Komiyama's
relationship with Student A. He said it was obvious that she
""adored"" him, and that Komiyama ""likes to be adored.""

https://www.greatfallstribune.com/story/news/2018/11/27/montana-state-settles-lawsuit-over-sexual-harassment/2125328002/,"BOZEMAN — Montana State University has agreed to pay $175,000 to a former student who filed a civil lawsuit alleging the school was negligent in hiring a convicted sex offender as a music teacher.The Bozeman Daily Chronicle reports MSU did not admit liability and settled the case earlier this month to avoid further litigation.A university investigation found assistant professor Shuichi Komiyama had an intimate relationship with the woman. She said she felt she had to give in to his sexual advances to further her career. He was hired in 2006 and resigned in September 2011.MSU earlier paid the woman $75,000 to settle a sexual harassment claim brought before the Human Rights Bureau.Komiyama pleaded guilty in 1990 to two felonies for having a sexual relationship with a California high school student when he was in his early 20s.  "

                                It was just after the July 4 holiday when a woman student first complained of sexual harassment by a Department of Earth Sciences professor at Montana State University.By Halloween, a second woman had come forward, and MSU’s Title IX office had completed a full-blown investigation. The investigation concluded the professor had violated federal Title IX law and university policy, by creating a hostile environment for female students and abusing his “position of power.”Yet throughout the months of investigation and for weeks after, associate professor Todd Feeley was still teaching, using his office in Traphagen Hall and walking the halls, despite a history that left some students and faculty colleagues fearful.When veteran professors attending a geology conference ran into “yet another” former MSU woman student with harassment stories about Feeley, they fired off email messages to university administrators urging them to act “quickly!”“I find this situation totally appalling and unacceptable,” longtime professor Dave Lageson wrote in an email to his college dean, the campus Title IX officer and MSU’s provost. “Everyone, faculty included, is wondering why this situation is taking so long to be resolved.”“Is there any hope we can get the President and Provost to take clear and decisive action in this case,” wrote Earth Sciences department head Dave Mogk, “to send a message to the department, campus and community that this type of behavior absolutely will not be tolerated at MSU?”The emails of Nov. 19, 2014, are among 87 pages of documents released to the Bozeman Daily Chronicle after a yearlong legal fight between the university and the newspaper.The Chronicle first asked MSU on July 7, 2015, for documents on allegations of misconduct by two associate professors in Earth Sciences.The newspaper said it was looking into complaints that MSU was slow to respond to accusations of unethical and inappropriate behavior. The late Todd Feeley was investigated for sexual advances on women students. In a separate case, which happened to be playing out at the same time but didn’t include sexual allegations, Michael H. Gardner was investigated for his treatment of students, according to court records filed in the case.The Chronicle requested MSU’s documents after hearing from professors outside of Earth Sciences, administration critics who alleged that MSU was trying to cover up the problems to protect its reputation and enrollment numbers — allegations the university vigorously rejects.“No, absolutely not,” said Tracy Ellig, MSU spokesman.The fact that the process took months, and that the university kept it confidential, doesn’t mean MSU was trying to hide something, Ellig said.“The idea this was some sort of cover-up to protect the university’s reputation is totally ridiculous,” Ellig said, “and flies in the face of understanding Title IX investigations, which are confidential.”The No. 1 reason Title IX investigations are confidential is to protect the student making the complaint, he said; the other major reason is to protect the accused professor, who is innocent until proven otherwise.Ellig criticized the Chronicle for repeating allegations from “totally anonymous” critics who “don’t have to check their facts.”In August 2015, MSU legal counsel Kellie Peterson told a Chronicle reporter she was willing to release investigation documents. But Gardner and his attorney objected.Citing the risk of litigation, MSU then filed a lawsuit in Gallatin County District Court against the newspaper and two professors, asking the judge to weigh the public’s right to know against individuals’ right to privacy.One year later, District Judge John Brown issued a sealed ruling in the case. MSU then released documents on Feeley, but not on Gardner.Rare problemThe documents released in Feeley’s case (with sections blacked out to protect students’ privacy) show many times that MSU officials acted quickly, often within hours, upon learning of students’ complaints and that they took the students seriously.Still, the professors’ cases dragged on, unresolved after many months.More than eight months after woman students first started coming forward with accusations against Feeley, he was still an MSU professor, still on the payroll, though on medical leave and barred from contacting women students in the case.Despite that precaution, one woman student was worried enough in February 2015 that she asked the university to change the lock to the room where she had a desk.The following month, on March 22, 2015, Feeley took his own life.Ellig said that behavior so problematic that the university seeks to fire a tenured professor is a rare event.To fire a tenured professor, Montana Board of Regents policy requires adequate cause: conviction of a felony or crime of moral turpitude; endangering the welfare of or exploiting students; failure to carry out faculty responsibilities, as determined by peers on a Committee on Service; fraud or misrepresenting accomplishments; or gross insubordination.Ellig said that recently retired MSU attorney Leslie Taylor could recall only three times in the past 27 years that the university actually initiated termination proceedings against tenured professors.Strongest case possibleDoes the passage of eight months in Feeley’s case indicate that MSU was slow to act?“We believe we moved as rapidly as we could based on the information we had,” Ellig said.“We launched an investigation in short order and took steps appropriate to the circumstances to protect the (student) complainant from Feeley while the investigation was under way,” he wrote.After MSU Title IX officer Kathleen Grimes’ report on Feeley arrived on administrators’ desks Oct. 31, “the university was weighing what would be the appropriate action,” Ellig wrote.“Then on Nov. 19, Professor Dave Lageson provided another student complaint,” Ellig wrote.“The university chose to investigate this complaint before acting on Grimes’ report. Why? Because the university wanted all of the relevant information before proceeding with an intent to terminate a tenured faculty member — and in the case of Dr. Feeley, the university was leaning in that direction.”Firing a tenured professor is a lengthy process, and a committee of faculty peers, a Committee on Service, would review the administration’s case, Ellig said.“Knowing this,” Ellig wrote, “the administration wanted to have the strongest case possible.”The university’s response in a Title IX case depends on the specifics of each complaint, he said, which can range from “inconsiderate, ill-mannered behavior to the extreme of rape.”Sanctions, Ellig said, can range from warnings to mandatory trainings, removing individuals from contact with certain students, expulsion of an accused student and termination of a faculty or staff member.Poisoned reputationWhile the wheels within MSU’s administration were turning toward firing, over at Traphagen Hall, Earth Sciences students and faculty kept running into Feeley, who was teaching and walking the halls where his student accusers took classes.Lageson’s Nov. 19 email, expressing frustration to administrators, said that though the investigation was confidential, students in the department talked to each other.“ALL the students” knew, Lageson wrote, that the university was looking into sexual advances on women students, drunkenness in summer geology camp, abandoning students during a car caravan, belligerent behavior and promoting an atmosphere among immature young male students that was hostile to female students.“I have spent the majority of my professional career at MSU (over 34 years and counting) and have devoted myself to making this department one of the best field-based geoscience programs in the country,” Lageson wrote.“I feel that Dr. Feeley has poisoned the reputation of our summer field course, our department, and Montana State University….“I fully understand that diligence and care must be taken with an investigation of this type, but it is beginning to appear that the university is not taking this very seriously, despite the severe allegations,” Lageson wrote. “In the meantime, Dr. Feeley is skating along under the radar while the rest of us (senior faculty) are picking up the slack in the department….“Montana State University needs to address this situation before more damage is done — quickly!”Trouble in TraphagenTodd Feeley’s troubles seemed to start the day he got angry and his colleagues got scared.Denied promotion by an MSU committee, he stood in the entrance to Traphagen Hall at 2:30 p.m. on a January afternoon and, in front of students, laid into two colleagues, professors Lageson and Jim Schmitt, demanding answers.“I am not a person who is intimidated by other people very easily, but I am concerned not only for my own safety but also for the safety of others,” Schmitt wrote on Jan. 29, 2014, to Earth Sciences department head Mogk.Mogk wrote an email right away expressing concern to his boss, College of Letters and Science Dean Nicol Rae. Mogk wrote that he planned to alert campus police to “the possibility of other dangerous confrontations.”The dean alerted the promotion committee, the human resources officer and his boss, Provost Martha Potvin.Potvin, then the No. 2 administrator for the entire MSU campus, wrote back to the dean the same afternoon, offering, if he wished, to tell Feeley herself that his behavior was unacceptable and needed to stop immediately.Being denied promotion probably felt unfair to Feeley. Working at MSU since 1996, Feeley had become an internationally recognized expert on volcanoes, studying in Bolivia, Chile, the Bering Sea and at Mount St. Helens in Washington.Lots of students liked Feeley. They gave him good reviews on the Uloop website rating Montana professors, calling him hilarious, fun, quirky, caring, a cool guy, “super cute” and passionate about teaching.Several former students praised him online after his death. One wrote that Feeley had been a “very bright and good teacher” who taught “everything from ‘Rocks for Jocks’ to volcanology, tectonics” and was “fiercely passionate about defending science against creationism.”Five months passed after the Traphagen outburst, apparently without incident, and Mogk wrote that he thought Feeley was making progress.Unwanted advancesThen on July 7, 2014, a female undergraduate, one of more than two dozen students returning from a summer geology field camp led by Feeley, made allegations of sexual harassment and misconduct, according to the redacted documents released by MSU.Department head Mogk listened to her and thanked the young woman for her courage. She wrote that she wanted to keep things confidential from her family and the public. Mogk immediately emailed his dean on July 8, 2014, about unprofessional conduct by Feeley and “unwanted advances of a sexual nature.”Students are adults and it was a long tradition to allow a beer or two at the end of the day sitting around the campfire, Mogk wrote, but Feeley was allowing excessive drinking. He also let vehicles in a caravan become “lost” or separated, leaving several students with no supervision or geology instruction during the road trip.Three days later, the Title IX officer interviewed the first woman student. The Title IX officer is in charge of investigating allegations of sexual harassment, which would violate the federal law that prohibits discrimination by sex in education.The student said she had been extremely uncomfortable around Feeley, avoided him and was “very concerned about pissing off” the professor because she was worried about her grade.Administrators from MSU’s human resources and the dean’s office interviewed additional students from the summer field camp, who said they had an “outstanding” learning experience. But the students also said that Feeley had outbursts in public, encouraged loud behavior and wolf calls, disturbed other campers, yelled at students, was rude to tourists, had drinking in camp every night and drank excessively. Students said he had a reputation for “partying hard” on all his field camps and seemed to blatantly ignore rules “to be one of the group.”On July 18, interim director Corky Bush sent Feeley notice that the Title IX office was going to start a formal investigation of sexual harassment and sexual misconduct. She told him to have no contract with any student, staff or faculty member, except Mogk.A month later, on Aug. 22, Bush told Feeley that the investigation wasn’t complete but he could resume teaching, research and service duties when fall classes started, on the condition he not contact specific students and not lead any trips.New allegationsHowever on the same day, Aug. 22, a second woman student came forward with a new, apparently more serious allegation of sexual misconduct by Feeley during a professional trip.This was one of our strongest students, Mogk wrote in an email to the Title IX office. But, he said, after “verbal abuse” by Feeley, student No. 2 was in fear of even being near him in class and offices. The Title IX office interviewed her four days later.Before the second woman came forward, Mogk wrote that he’d thought Feeley had been correcting his ways and could continue to teach geology classes and lead hikes, where he earned good reviews from students. Mogk apologized for not forbidding all field trips by Feeley, as Dean Rae had originally recommended.Mogk wrote that over the years at least two other female grad students had left the graduate program rather than work with Feeley. Against one woman, he had made “ hominem attacks on her as a person and scholar.”“Neither of these involve sexual misconduct allegations,” Mogk wrote, “but show a pattern of emotional abuse toward students.”Students weren’t the only ones to feel the professor’s anger.On Oct. 16, MSU registrar Bonnie Ashley wrote to Mogk complaining about Feeley’s “belligerent,” “rude and unprofessional behavior.” She said Feeley had launched into a “lengthy tirade” on the phone against one of her employees. And despite having a student advisee sitting in his office, Feeley had complained on the phone about how many students he had to advise and how valuable his time was.The real victimGrimes, then MSU’s Title IX officer, issued her “final report” on the Feeley investigation on Oct. 31 — nearly four months after student No. 1’s complaint of sexual advances at summer field camp and two months after student No. 2’s complaint from an out-of-town trip.Grimes had interviewed several students and witnesses, former students who had left MSU after being verbally abused, and Feeley himself.Interviewed on Sept. 15, Feeley denied everything alleged by student No. 2. But the next day he returned and told Grimes that he had apologized to the student for making a sexual advance and apologized again as they returned to Bozeman. He said he and the woman student had “agreed they would not tell anyone.”“He stated on several occasions,” Grimes wrote, “that he felt as though he was actually the victim.”Grimes’ report concluded that the students were credible and that by the preponderance of evidence, the allegations against Feeley were substantiated. The professor had created a hostile environment for female students and abused his “position of power.”Final decisionDespite the damning Oct. 31 investigative report, nothing apparently changed for Feeley for weeks.“I hope the administration will take immediate and definitive action,” Mogk emailed Nov. 3. Mogk told the dean and human resources officer he needed to know soon if Feeley would be barred from teaching classes in spring semester because the department would have to make alternate plans on short notice.Ellig said Feeley was allowed to write a rebuttal to the Title IX report, and he did so. It wasn’t among the documents released to the newspaper.Three weeks after the Title IX report, Nicol Rae, dean of the College of Letters and Science, sent notice to Feeley on Nov. 25. The dean said that due to the ongoing investigation, Feeley should not work with any students during the spring 2015 semester, but work 100 percent on research, until the investigation was resolved. He told Feeley not to retaliate or communicate with anyone who filed a report against him.Ironically, the new information from Lageson on Nov. 19 caused another delay. Grimes did more interviews and wrote an addendum to her final report. The addendum was completed Dec. 8.Provost Potvin emailed copies of the reports to her boss, President Waded Cruzado, on the morning of Dec. 17. It was six weeks after the Oct. 31 Title IX report and one week after the Dec. 8 addendum was completed.Sixteen minutes after Potvin’s email, Cruzado replied by email from her iPhone.“Thank you, Martha, I am sure we will notify the department head with plenty of advance notice. I would also recommend for you and the Dean to meet with him to discuss the case, including confidentiality requirements. Thanks, Waded.”About 40 minutes later, Cruzado emailed Potvin to indicate she didn’t want to wait to act, though it was a week before Christmas.“Martha, after reading this report, I agree with your proposed course of action. I would not delay notice until after the holiday, but prefer notification this week,” Cruzado wrote.The next day Potvin wrote an email saying she agreed with the approach suggested by MSU legal counsel Taylor. The next week, Feeley requested medical leave.Medical leave put administrative action against Feeley on hold, Ellig said.During the spring 2015 semester, Feeley was on medical leave, ordered to stay away from female students who filed complaints against him. Despite the order, on Feb. 10, 2015, a female student reported a violation and apparently fearing for her safety, asked MSU to change a lock.A month later, on March 22, Feeley took his own life.The next day Cruzado sent an email to all faculty and students, saying that it was with great sadness she shared the news of Feeley’s passing. Cruzado recounted his accomplishments and wrote that Feeley would be remembered for his passion for geology and promoting scientific thinking and evolution, and leading volcanology field trips around the West.In the following days, Potvin, who has since left MSU for another college, wrote to several staff members, offering to talk if they wished about “last weekend’s tragedy.”Eight months after the initial complaint, MSU hadn’t completely resolved how to handle the difficult and, to some, frightening professor.It was Feeley himself who had made the final decision.Differing perspectivesMSU’s released documents show several factors contributed to delay in resolving Feeley’s case.— At least five departments within the MSU bureaucracy were involved in decisions. Information had to go up the ladder from the Earth Sciences department head, to the dean’s office, human resources department, Title IX office and finally the Montana Hall offices of MSU’s top administrators.— Final decisions were in the hands of the provost and president. Provost Potvin had been informed of Feeley’s troubled behavior since January 2014. Cruzado’s name doesn’t appear in the documents until she received Potvin’s email on Dec. 17. On that day, the provost and president agreed on the action MSU needed to take.— Ellig said he doesn’t know when the president became aware of the Feeley case, but a Title IX investigation of a professor “is the responsibility of the academic provost. The president may have been aware but not intimately involved.”— Feeley’s medical leave put any action toward termination on hold until his leave expired, which would have occurred around April. MSU doesn’t proceed with firing while an employee is on leave, Ellig said, because it means a doctor has said there is a serious health issue, the person is too ill to work and presumably too ill to defend themselves.“The university planned to begin termination proceedings against Feeley” after his medical leave expired, Ellig wrote.Though it’s not in the released documents, Ellig said that Feeley notified the university on Dec. 3 that he intended to seek medical leave.“For our perspective, once he gave that intent to file, it stopped the clock” on the termination process, Ellig said.— The case took longer to resolve than the six months it took to settle the case of Shuichi Komiyama, one of the few cases of MSU trying to fire a tenured professor that have become public in recent years.In that case, on April 1, 2011, a female undergraduate told the music department head that Komiyama had raped her. After receiving her accusation in writing on April 9, MSU immediately banned Komiyama from campus. MSU launched a Title IX investigation, which took three months — roughly the same time taken for Feeley’s investigation. Komiyama resigned Sept. 30, dropping his fight against MSU, roughly six months after the initial rape report.Ellig said that MSU acted immediately to put Komiyama on leave because a student alleged she was raped and there were concerns that other students were at risk. By contrast, Ellig said, there was no allegation of rape in the Feeley case and no evidence of ongoing sexual harassment after the July field camp.Whether MSU acted in a timely way or was too slow may depend on who is answering the question.The students and faculty members who felt unsafe, stressed or afraid had to live with it for eight months, but were powerless to resolve it. They wanted MSU to act “quickly!”Administrators, who didn’t live with the problems every day, had the power to act. Yet they had to act within MSU rules and state and federal laws, uphold faculty tenure policies, protect the confidentiality of students and faculty, and avoid lawsuits. They felt MSU acted “as rapidly as we could.”Why did President Cruzado’s Dec. 17 email urge the provost and dean to remind the department head about “confidentiality requirements”? Ellig said it was “to simply remind people these are confidential investigations. To assume that is a signal the university is trying to cover something up is a gigantic leap. It’s a reminder these investigations are confidential to protect the complainant and for the protection of the accused.”Concern for MSU’s reputation played absolutely no role, Ellig said.“I and members of the executive team have had many conversations about this issue — We are not going to be afraid of reporting of sexual assaults on campus or sexual harassment,” he said. “It’s clear that one thing that has led to the culture of sexual assault is lack of discussion, lack of visibility. We also have to operate within the bounds of confidentiality.”

                McKnight was charged with one count of assault and one count of sexual offense on May 14, 2013
Professor Clifton A. McKnight, accused of 2nd-degree assault, stood before Judge Audrey A. Creighton on the morning of Monday, Feb. 24 at the Rockville District Court of Maryland. He pleaded guilty to this charge, admitting to physical contact.
McKnight teaches Career Development and Study Habits and is a counselor at Montgomery College. According to Montgomery College counselor Linda Robinson’s testimony, McKnight has been a faculty member at the school for over 15 years. He has also published a book, and given motivational lectures.
According to the state attorney, on May 14, 2013 Keeta Coleman, 21, a student at Montgomery College, visited McKnight’s office for an unscheduled appointment. At the end of the meeting, she felt uncomfortable as he hugged her and forced her hand to his genital area.  On May21, 2013, Coleman reported the incident to the Office of Equity and Diversity at MC. Since the victim claims this contact to be unwanted, she is protected under the law, no matter his intentions.
The defense claims that the meeting was mutually agreed upon, and the two had met and talked about school as well as Coleman’s personal life on a previous occasion. When the meeting was over, McKnight went for a hug and Coleman did not object, but he felt apprehension from her and withdrew.
Coleman chose not to appear in court.
The defense lawyer, Robinson Rowe, brought three witnesses to corroborate McKnight’s character, in order to contrast the allegations and prove them unfit. Robinson and fellow MC Counselor Gus Griffin testified along with McKnight’s sister-in-law. All of the witnesses, as well as Rowe described McKnight as “a big teddy-bear”, often mentioning that he was someone people turned to for help and support.
McKnight’s colleague, Linda Robinson, in her testimony said McKnight “is the most kind, compassionate, loving human being that I know.”  This case and its ramifications makes her concerned about her future interactions and relationships with her students. “I’m frightened” she said.
Judge Creighton deliberated over the evidence, striking the finding of guilt and giving McKnight the benefit of probation before judgement. Probation before judgement states that McKnight is on general probation for three years, beginning Feb 24. If his record is clean after that period, said case can be expunged from his record.
McKnight said he was “extremely disappointed” that any interaction with him could be taken as negative. “If people voice concerns, I aim to correct communication immediately.”
In addition, McKnight is required to complete 40 hours of community service and is banned from any physical contact with students at MC or any other school, with the exception of family members. He must also pay a fine of $250 plus court fees, as well as the monthly parole fee of $50.

https://casetext.com/case/slater-v-marshall-4,"  J. JOYNER, District Judge.   Plaintiff, Linda Slater, has filed a Motion to Dismiss Defendant Richard E. Marshall's Counterclaim against her for defamation. Plaintiff's Complaint alleges that Defendant Marshall is a professor at Montgomery County Community College (MCCC) who sexually harassed and stalked Plaintiff while she was his student. Defendant's Counterclaim alleges that Plaintiff defamed him when she reported the alleged stalking to another teacher at MCCC.  Standard of Review     MCCC is also a defendant to this action.   The Counterclaim also alleges that Plaintiff defamed Defendant when she reported the alleged stalking to several police officers. Based on the ruling in Pawlowski v. Smorto, 403 Pa.Super. 71, 588 A.2d 36 (1991), Defendant concedes that this aspect of his defamation claim should be dismissed.   In considering a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, a court must primarily consider the allegations contained in the complaint, although matters of public record, orders, items appearing in the record of the case and exhibits attached to the complaint may also be taken into account. Chester County Intermediate Unit v. Pennsylvania Blue Shield, 896 F.2d 808, 812 (3d Cir. 1990). The Court must accept as true all of the allegations in the pleadings and must give the plaintiff the benefit of every favorable inference that can be drawn from those allegations. Schrob v.

A complaint is properly dismissed only if it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of its claim which would entitle it to relief. Ransom v. Marrazzo, 848 F.2d 398, 401 (3d Cir. 1988).   Analysis   The Counterclaim alleges that Plaintiff told Holly Cairns, a part-time faculty member of MCCC, that Defendant had stalked Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues that this defamation claim should be dismissed because any statements she made were absolutely privileged under the judicial proceedings privilege doctrine.    Plaintiff does not seek to dismiss the counterclaim on the basis that it does not state a claim for defamation. For the purposes of this motion, therefore, we assume that the statement does state a cause of action for defamation.   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in Post v. Mendel, 510 Pa. 213, 507 A.2d 351 (1986) has set the parameters of the judicial proceedings privilege. The Supreme Court held that this absolute privilege shields any and all communications made in connection with a judicial proceeding. Id. at 217, 507 A.2d at 353. This privilege protects statements in open court, as well as pleadings, preliminary conferences, correspondence between counsel in furtherance of a client's interest and pre-trial communications between counsel and witness. Pawlowski, 403 Pa.Super. at 81, 588 A.2d at 41 (citing cases). The privilege is not limited to communications made only after the institution of a suit. Rather, it also protects ""defamatory matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course and as a part of, a judicial proceeding."" Id. at 83, 588 A.2d at 42 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 587).   Plaintiff asserts that her statements were in the course of a judicial proceeding because her Complaint was filed on October 20, 1994, and the Counterclaim alleges that her statements were made in ""late October, 1994."" She argues that as a result, ""clearly any statements made by [Plaintiff] in `late October' were in the context of being in the course of or pertinent to any stage of judicial proceeding."" Pl.'s Brief at 4. This argument appears to assert that if a judicial proceeding is contemplated, any communications made to any person that relate in any way to the subject matter of the judicial proceeding are absolutely privileged. This argument is not an accurate reading of Pennsylvania's law.   In Post, the Supreme Court expressly limited the absolute privilege's scope and ruled that a defamatory letter was not absolutely privileged when it was copied to a judge, the Supreme Court's Disciplinary Board and an alleged client of the person the letter defamed. The letter was from one attorney to another, and criticized the other attorney for his alleged unethical behavior before a Pennsylvania court. The defendant argued that because the letter concerned the plaintiff's behavior in a judicial proceeding that the letter was therefore absolutely privileged. The defendant also argued that the letter was intended to institute disciplinary proceedings, and so was absolutely privileged under the Restatement's § 587.   The Supreme Court held that the judicial proceedings privilege extended only to communications issued "" in the regular course of judicial proceedings and which are pertinent  and material to the redress or relief sought."" 510 Pa. at 221, 507 A.2d at 355 (quoting Kemper v.

With respect to defamatory communications made prior to the commencement of a judicial proceeding, the Supreme Court limited the privilege to communications made ""in the regular course of preparing for contemplated proceedings."" Id. at 223, 507 A.2d at 356 (emphasis added). As a result, because the letter was not directly relevant to the court proceedings and because it was not in the regular course of a disciplinary proceeding to copy such a letter to the judge and the client, the Supreme Court held that the letter was not privileged.

The Counterclaim, accordingly, pleads no facts to indicate that the judicial proceedings privilege applies. For this reason, Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Defendant's Counterclaim is denied.

*94 Standard of Review

In considering a Rule 12(b) (6) motion, a court must primarily consider the allegations contained in the complaint, although matters of public record, orders, items appearing in the record of the case and exhibits attached to the complaint may also be taken into account. Chester County Intermediate Unit v. Pennsylvania Blue Shield, 896 F.2d 808, 812 (3d Cir. 1990). The Court must accept as true all of the allegations in the pleadings and must give the plaintiff the benefit of every favorable inference that can be drawn from those allegations. Schrob v.

A complaint is properly dismissed only if it appears certain that the plaintiff cannot prove any set of facts in support of its claim which would entitle it to relief. Ransom v. Marrazzo, 848 F.2d 398, 401 (3d Cir.1988). 
Analysis
The Counterclaim alleges that Plaintiff told Holly Cairns, a part-time faculty member of MCCC, that Defendant had stalked Plaintiff. Plaintiff argues that this defamation claim should be dismissed because any statements she made were absolutely privileged under the judicial proceedings privilege doctrine.[3]
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, in Post v. Mendel, 510 Pa. 213, 507 A.2d 351 (1986) has set the parameters of the judicial proceedings privilege. The Supreme Court held that this absolute privilege shields any and all communications made in connection with a judicial proceeding. Id. at 217, 507 A.2d  at 353. This privilege protects statements in open court, as well as pleadings, preliminary conferences, correspondence between counsel in furtherance of a client's interest and pre-trial communications between counsel and witness. Pawlowski, 403 Pa.Super. at 81, 588 A.2d  at 41 (citing cases). The privilege is not limited to communications made only after the institution of a suit. Rather, it also protects ""defamatory matter concerning another in communications preliminary to a proposed judicial proceeding, or in the institution of or during the course and as a part of, a judicial proceeding."" Id. at 83, 588 A.2d  at 42 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 587).
Plaintiff asserts that her statements were in the course of a judicial proceeding because her Complaint was filed on October 20, 1994, and the Counterclaim alleges that her statements were made in ""late October, 1994."" She argues that as a result, ""clearly any statements made by [Plaintiff] in `late October' were in the context of being in the course of or pertinent to any stage of judicial proceeding."" Pl.'s Brief at 4. This argument appears to assert that if a judicial proceeding is contemplated, any communications made to any person that relate in any way to the subject matter of the judicial proceeding are absolutely privileged. This argument is not an accurate reading of Pennsylvania's law.
In Post, the Supreme Court expressly limited the absolute privilege's scope and ruled that a defamatory letter was not absolutely privileged when it was copied to a judge, the Supreme Court's Disciplinary Board and an alleged client of the person the letter defamed. The letter was from one attorney to another, and criticized the other attorney for his alleged unethical behavior before a Pennsylvania court. The defendant argued that because the letter concerned the plaintiff's behavior in a judicial proceeding that the letter was therefore absolutely privileged. The defendant also argued that the letter was intended to institute disciplinary proceedings, and so was absolutely privileged under the Restatement's § 587.
The Supreme Court held that the judicial proceedings privilege extended only to communications issued ""in the regular course of judicial proceedings and which are pertinent *95 and material to the redress or relief sought."" 510 Pa. at 221, 507 A.2d  at 355 (quoting Kemper v.

Id. at 223, 507 A.2d  at 356 (emphasis added). As a result, because the letter was not directly relevant to the court proceedings and because it was not in the regular course of a disciplinary proceeding to copy such a letter to the judge and the client, the Supreme Court held that the letter was not privileged. Id. at 221-24, 507 A.2d  at 356-57.
Here, Plaintiff allegedly told Defendant's co-worker that Defendant had stalked Plaintiff. The Counterclaim does not allege that Ms. Cairns was an appropriate person to whom a student would report such a matter. Nor does it allege that Plaintiff spoke to Ms. Cairns in the regular course of preparation of this lawsuit. The Counterclaim, accordingly, pleads no facts to indicate that the judicial proceedings privilege applies. For this reason, Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Defendant's Counterclaim is denied.
An appropriate Order follows. 
ORDER
AND NOW, this 18th day of August, 1995, upon consideration of Plaintiff's Motion to Dismiss Counterclaim of Defendant Richard Marshall Pursuant to Rule 12(b) (6) and response thereto, the Motion is hereby GRANTED in PART and DENIED in PART. The Motion is hereby GRANTED in that Defendant Marshall's Counterclaim of defamation based on statements made to police officers is hereby DISMISSED with PREJUDICE. The Motion is hereby DENIED in all other respects.
NOTES
[1]  MCCC is also a defendant to this action.
[2]  The Counterclaim also alleges that Plaintiff defamed Defendant when she reported the alleged stalking to several police officers. Based on the ruling in Pawlowski v. Smorto, 403 Pa.Super. 71, 588 A.2d 36 (1991), Defendant concedes that this aspect of his defamation claim should be dismissed.
[3]  Plaintiff does not seek to dismiss the counterclaim on the basis that it does not state a claim for defamation. For the purposes of this motion, therefore, we assume that the statement does state a cause of action for defamation.

https://casetext.com/case/farley-v-new-river-cmty-technical-coll," IRENE C. BERGER UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST VIRGINIA MEMORANDUM OPINION AND ORDER The Court has reviewed New River Community and Technical College's Motion to Dismiss (Document 6) and Memorandum of Law in Support (Document 5), the Plaintiffs' Response to New River Community and Technical College's Motion to Dismiss with Incorporated Memorandum of Law (Document 12), and New River Community and Technical College's Reply to Plaintiffs' Response to Its Motion to Dismiss (Document 13). The Court has also reviewed all attached exhibits and the Plaintiff's Complaint (Document 1-1). For the reasons stated herein, the Court finds that the motion should be granted.   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND  The Plaintiffs, Rebecca and Kevin Farley, initiated this suit in the Circuit Court of Raleigh County, West Virginia, on September 2, 2016. They named New River Community and Technical College (""New River"") and Michael S. Curry as defendants. New River removed the  matter to this Court on October 10, 2016, citing federal question jurisdiction. The Plaintiffs allege that Rebecca Farley was a student at New River from the time she enrolled in January of 2012 until she graduated in May of 2015. In the fall semester of 2012, Ms. Farley took two classes from the Defendant, Professor Michael Curry. While taking his classes, Ms. Farley exchanged text messages with Professor Curry, but alleges that the text messages strictly concerned course related matters.  At some point during the month of December 2012, the Plaintiffs allege that Professor Curry sent an inappropriate email to Ms. Farley containing a picture of ""his erect penis."" (Pls.' Complaint, at ¶29.) On or about December 21, 2012, the Plaintiffs allege that Professor Curry also sent an inappropriate text message to Ms. Farley's phone containing ""a picture of [his] naked and hairy legs."" (Id. at ¶17-20.) Ms. Farley's husband saw the picture before Ms. Farley did, and, suspecting that Ms. Farley was having an affair, confronted her about the message. Ms. Farley denied ever engaging in any type of inappropriate relationship with Professor Curry. Mr. Farley alleges that he promptly reported the conduct to New River, but that New River refused to investigate his complaint because he was not a student. Ms. Farley also alleges that she then complained to the school about Professor Curry's conduct, but states that she ""did not press her complaint, however, because Professor Curry was teaching a course the following semester . . . that was a required course for Rebecca's major,"" and she ""feared that pressing her complaint . . . would harm her ability to succeed in Professor Curry's class."" (Id. at ¶33-35.) Ms. Farley alleges that, because she did not press her complaint, New River did not appropriately investigate it. After the spring semester of 2013, Ms. Farley had no more classes with Professor Curry.   On September 6, 2014, Ms. Farley went to New River's Raleigh County campus. That evening, at approximately 11:00 p.m., Professor Curry allegedly sent another text to Ms. Farley's phone. Mr. Farley noticed the text before Ms. Farley, and again became very angry. Mr. Farley alleges that he began to respond to Professor Curry's texts to ensure that it was him. Mr. Farley alleges that he woke Ms. Farley up to show her the texts, and that the two began to continue exchanging texts ""in order to further draw out Professor Curry."" (Id. at ¶49.) The Plaintiffs allege that Professor Curry sent texts to Ms. Farley's phone that expressed how he was aroused by Ms. Farley and how he wanted her to ""jump [his] bones,"" and that Professor Curry again sent a picture to Ms. Farley's phone ""contain[ing] a picture of his erect penis."" (Id. at ¶44-45.) Professor Curry also allegedly sent text messages to Ms. Farley ""instructing her to 'Take off those shorts.'"" (Id. at ¶50.)  On the following Monday, September 8, 2014, Ms. Farley complained to New River about Professor Curry's messages, and New River initiated an investigation into Professor Curry's reported conduct. However, Ms. Farley asserts that in conducting their investigation, New River only interviewed her, and that questions posed to her attempted to minimize the alleged incident and seek out whether she had incidents similar to this in her past. Professor Curry resigned from New River in October of 2014. Ms. Farley alleges that, as a result of Professor Curry's conduct, she lost her passion for school, her attendance fell, and her grades slipped. She also alleges that New River offered no assistance to help with what Professor Curry had done to her, and that she had to endure rumors and speculation throughout campus that she engaged in inappropriate conduct with Professor Curry. She alleges that these circumstances took away her drive to attend college and led her to look for reasons to skip class and not be on campus. Mr. and Mrs. Farley  assert causes of action of sexual harassment and discrimination by both Professor Curry and New River in violation of Title IX. The Plaintiffs also assert a claim of reckless infliction of emotional distress against Professor Curry himself.  New River filed a motion to dismiss the claims against it on October 12, 2016. The Plaintiffs filed a response in opposition on November 7, 2016 and New River filed its reply on November 11, 2016. The motion is fully briefed and ripe for review.   STANDARD OF REVIEW  A motion to dismiss filed pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted tests the legal sufficiency of a complaint or pleading. Francis v. Giacomelli, 588 F.3d 186, 192 (4th Cir. 2009); Giarratano v. Johnson, 521 F.3d 298, 302 (4th Cir. 2008). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires that a pleading contain ""a short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2). Additionally, allegations ""must be simple, concise, and direct."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(1). ""[T]he pleading standard Rule 8 announces does not require 'detailed factual allegations,' but it demands more than an unadorned, the-defendant-unlawfully-harmed-me accusation."" Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (quoting Bell Atlantic Corp v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, 555 (2007)). In other words, ""a complaint must contain ""more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do."" Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555. Moreover, ""a complaint [will not] suffice if it tenders naked assertions devoid of further factual enhancements."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557) (internal quotation marks omitted).   The Court must ""accept as true all of the factual allegations contained in the complaint."" Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 93 (2007). The Court must also ""draw[ ] all reasonable factual inferences from those facts in the plaintiff's favor."" Edwards v. City of Goldsboro, 178 F.3d 231, 244 (4th Cir. 1999). However, statements of bare legal conclusions ""are not entitled to the assumption of truth"" and are insufficient to state a claim. Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679. Furthermore, the court need not ""accept as true unwarranted inferences, unreasonable conclusions, or arguments."" E. Shore Mkts., v. J.D. Assocs. Ltd. P'ship, 213 F.3d 175, 180 (4th Cir. 2000). ""Threadbare recitals of the elements of a cause of action, supported by mere conclusory statements, do not suffice . . . [because courts] 'are not bound to accept as true a legal conclusion couched as a factual allegation.'"" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 555).  To survive a motion to dismiss, ""a complaint must contain sufficient factual matter, accepted as true, 'to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.'"" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 678 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). In other words, this ""plausibility standard requires a plaintiff to demonstrate more than 'a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.'"" Francis, 588 F.3d at 193 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 570). A plaintiff must, using the complaint, ""articulate facts, when accepted as true, that 'show' that the plaintiff has stated a claim entitling him to relief."" Francis, 588 F.3d at 193 (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 557). ""Determining whether a complaint states [on its face] a plausible claim for relief [which can survive a motion to dismiss] will . . . be a context-specific task that requires the reviewing court to draw on its judicial experience and common sense."" Iqbal, 556 U.S. at 679.    DISCUSSION  New River seeks dismissal of the Plaintiffs' Title IX claim. At the outset, the Court notes that the Plaintiffs and the Defendant agree that Mr. Farley has no standing to assert Title IX claims against New River because he was not a student at New River. Both parties further agree that the Plaintiffs cannot recover damages on any alleged harassment that occurred in 2012 because the statute of limitations has lapsed. The Court agrees and finds that any Title IX claims asserted by Mr. Farley must be dismissed because at no time was he a student at New River. Further, pursuant to W.Va. Code § 55-2-12, the statute of limitations for Title IX claims is two years. Accordingly, any claims for recovery based on alleged harassment that occurred in 2012 should be dismissed.  Title IX provides that ""[n]o person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" 20 U.S.C. § 1681. ""To establish a Title IX claim on the basis of sexual harassment, a plaintiff must show that (1) she was a student at an educational institution receiving federal funds, (2) she was subjected to harassment based on her sex, (3) the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile (or abusive) environment in an educational program or activity, and (4) there is a basis for imputing liability to the institution."" Jennings v. Univ. of N. Carolina, 482 F.3d 686, 695 (4th Cir. 2007).  A. Severe and Pervasive Harassment  Conceding that Ms. Farley has satisfied the first two elements of a Title IX claim, New River first argues that Ms. Farley's Title IX claims must fail because she has not pled sufficient facts to establish that Professor Curry's alleged harassment was severe or pervasive. New River  argues that the Plaintiffs only point to two occasions of alleged harassment over a period of three and a half years, and that the only occurrence of alleged harassment came in the form of text messages. New River further contends that Ms. Farley did not have any classes with Professor Curry at the time she received the text messages in December 2014, and that when those messages were received, Ms. Farley and her husband sent responses to Professor Curry that led him to believe the exchange was welcome and consensual. Therefore, New River argues that the Plaintiffs have not proven that the alleged harassment was severe or pervasive enough to constitute a Title IX violation.  The Plaintiffs argue that the text messages sent to Ms. Farley were more than merely sexually suggestive, but were obscene, including an alleged close-up picture of Professor Curry's genitalia in an aroused state. Further, the Plaintiffs contend that Professor Curry's texts were predatory in nature when considered in conjunction with his position as a professor at the time they were sent. Because of Professor Curry's position of authority and trust, the Plaintiffs argue that the messages sent to Ms. Farley were indeed severe and pervasive enough to satisfy a Title IX claim.  Concerning the severity element of a Title IX claim, the Jennings Court stated as follows:    Harassment reaches the sufficiently severe or pervasive level when it creates an environment that a reasonable person would find hostile or abusive and that the victim herself subjectively perceives to be abusive. Whether gender-oriented harassment amounts to actionable (severe or pervasive) discrimination depends on a constellation of surrounding circumstances, expectations, and relationships. All the circumstances are examined, including the positions and ages of the harasser and victim, whether the harassment was frequent, severe, humiliating, or physically threatening, and whether it effectively deprived the victim of educational opportunities or benefits.   Jennings, 482 F.3d at 696 (internal quotations emitted) (emphasis added).   Ms. Farley alleged in her complaint that she received a string of lewd text messages from Professor Curry, including inappropriate pictures and statements clearly insinuating that Professor Curry wished to engage in a sexual relationship with Ms. Farley. While Ms. Farley was not in Professor Curry's class at the time, Professor Curry was still a professor at New River when he sent the messages, and still maintained a position of power and authority. While in this position, Ms. Farley alleges that Professor Curry said things like ""Saw you as I was leaving. Wanted you badly,"" ""Want you to jump my bones,"" and ""You smiled and dismissed my erection."" (Pls.' Complaint, Ex. 1.) Ms. Farley also alleges that Professor Curry sent a picture of ""his erect penis"" in this string of text messages (Id. at ¶45.), that she subjectively perceived this to be abusive and physically threatening, and that she felt feelings of humiliation and discomfort at receiving these messages as a married woman.  Given Professor Curry's position as her past professor and a current educational employee at New River when the text messages were sent, and accepting as true Ms. Farley's allegations regarding the content of the messages, the Court assumes, without finding, for purposes of this ruling, the facts alleged by Ms. Farley are sufficient to support severe and pervasive acts for purpose of a Title IX claim, regardless of the Plaintiffs' responses to the messages.    The Court notes that, even if responses from Mr. and Ms. Farley may partially mitigate the continued inappropriate conduct by Professor Curry, Professor Curry himself initiated the conversation and sent the first message.  B. Hostile or Abusive Environment  Second, New River seeks to dismiss Ms. Farley's Title IX claim on the ground that she has not stated facts sufficient to show she was deprived of any educational benefit at New River. New River argues that Ms. Farley has not alleged any facts in her complaint that she was discouraged from pursuing a complaint against Professor Curry, and that she has not alleged that New River  retaliated against her in any way after she lodged a formal complaint. New River also contends that Ms. Farley was not deprived of any educational benefit because she did not have any class with Professor Curry at the time the alleged harassment occurred in 2014, Professor Curry resigned from New River shortly after the alleged incident, and Ms. Farley graduated in May of 2015 with her associate's degree.  Ms. Farley counters that up until the alleged incident with Professor Curry in 2014, she earned excellent grades and her attendance was stellar. However, after the alleged incident, Ms. Farley's grades and attendance both suffered. Ms. Farley further asserts that even though Professor Curry resigned from the school once an investigation was initiated, he still managed ""to ruin the last year of her academic career"" due to the interviewing process she was forced to undergo during the college's investigation and because of the rumors she was forced to endure while she finished her degree, hardships she otherwise would not have had to endure in completing her education. The Plaintiffs contest that these allegations sufficiently state that Ms. Farley was deprived of educational benefits and therefore discriminated against under Title IX.  In proving actionable discrimination in a Title IX claim, ""a plaintiff must establish sexual harassment of students so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that so undermines and detracts from the victims' educational experience, that the victim-students are effectively denied equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities."" Davis v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 651 (1999). Further, ""[t]he relationship between the harasser and the victim necessarily affects the extent to which the misconduct can be said to breach Title IX's guarantee of equal access to educational benefits and to have a systematic effect on a program or activity."" Id. at 653. The Fourth Circuit explained in Jennings that, based on the Supreme Court's holding  in Davis, a victim's sexual harassment can be said to have denied the victim equal access to educational opportunities or benefits when, among other things, the harassment ""has 'a concrete negative effect on [the victim's] ability' to participate in an educational program or activity."" Jennings, 428 F.3d at 699 (internal citations omitted).  In Jennings, the Fourth Circuit found that the plaintiff had provided sufficient evidence to show that she suffered severe and pervasive sexual harassment in a manner that had a concrete negative effect on her ability to participate in the soccer program at her university. Id. The plaintiff, a member of the women's soccer team at the defendant university, presented evidence that the soccer coach regularly brought up and discussed inappropriate details of the players' sex lives in a manner that created a ""sexually charged atmosphere"" around the team. Id. at 697-99. The court noted that the plaintiff satisfied the Davis standard because she was not merely subjected to one encounter of sexual comments by the soccer coach, but that the coach had created an ""atmosphere"" under which the plaintiff and others on the team ""had to endure sexual harassment in order to play."" Id. at 700. The court further noted that the plaintiff had suffered two direct instances of harassment by the coach, one of which included an encounter in a hotel room wherein the coach asked her personal questions about her sex life with no other players around. Id. at 693. The plaintiff testified that the hostile atmosphere created by her soccer coach's constant discussion of the players' personal sex lives made her feel humiliated, anxious, and uncomfortable, which negatively affected her performance on the soccer team and in the classroom. Id. at 699. Thus, the court found that the coach's persistent talk about players' sex lives and the direct targeting of the plaintiff on two occasions created a hostile environment that lead to a drop in the plaintiff's  academic and athletic performance, thereby having a concrete, negative effect on her ability to participate in an educational program or activity. Id. at 700.  Here, the Court finds that Ms. Farley has not alleged sufficient facts in her complaint to survive a motion to dismiss under this prong of the Jennings elements. Ms. Farley's complaint alleges that on one actionable occasion Professor Curry sent her text messages clearly showing that he sought to engage in a sexual relationship with her while she was a student at New River. (Pls.' Complaint at ¶44-46.) While there can be no doubt that the messages Ms. Farley received were objectively offensive and clearly inappropriate, there are no allegations that Ms. Farley was forced to endure sexual harassment on a regular basis while earning her degree. Ms. Farley admitted in her complaint that Professor Curry was not her professor at the time he sent the text messages, and that he resigned from New River shortly after the investigation began. Thus, unlike the plaintiff in Jennings, Ms. Farley was not required to have continued contact with Professor Curry, was not subject to his leadership after the alleged incident occurred, and does not claim that any similar actions occurred after the conduct alleged in her complaint.  Ms. Farley does allege that she suffered embarrassment, stress, and anxiety due to the rumors on campus surrounding her allegations, and that her grades fell because of this stress and embarrassment. However, stress and embarrassment resulting from rumors and falsehoods is not the same as fear or continued suffering resulting from a persistent atmosphere of sexual harassment necessarily endured in order to finish school. The latter factual scenario is not alleged by Ms. Farley. Further, the Supreme Court in Davis failed to find that ""a mere 'decline in grades is enough to survive' a motion to dismiss."" Davis, 526 U.S. at 652. Given the absence of allegations in Ms. Farley's complaint supporting an atmosphere of sexual harassment that she had to endure  to earn her degree, the Court finds that she has not alleged sufficient facts to show that the alleged conduct created a hostile environment such that she was denied equal access to her institution's resources and opportunities. See, DeCecco v. Univ. of S.C., 918 F. Supp. 2d 471, 479 (D.S.C. 2013) (holding that one instance of alleged harassment wherein a soccer coach held a meeting with a player behind a locked door and allegedly toucher her thigh was not severe or pervasive under the Davis standard to create a hostile environment that denied plaintiff access to educational benefits or opportunities); Doe v. Georgetown Cty. Sch. Dist., No. 2:14-CV-01873-DCN, 2015 WL 5923610, at *1 (D.S.C. Oct. 9, 2015) (holding that one instance of alleged sex-based inappropriate comment by cheerleading coach to a student cheerleader was not severe or pervasive enough to effectively deny the student equal access to an institution's resources and opportunities and thus did not constitute harassment under Title IX).  The Court finds that the Plaintiff has not pled sufficient facts (when accepted as true) to support a finding that the alleged harassment she suffered was such that it deprived her of equal access to the institution's educational resources or opportunities. In other words, the Court grants New River's motion to dismiss inasmuch as the Plaintiff has not sufficiently alleged that the harassment of which she complains was sufficiently severe or pervasive to create a hostile or abusive environment in an educational program or activity. As a result, the Court need not address the Defendant's arguments on institutional liability.   CONCLUSION  WHEREFORE, after thorough review and careful consideration, the Court ORDERS that New River Community and Technical College's Motion to Dismiss (Document 6) be GRANTED.   The Court DIRECTS the Clerk to send a copy of this Order to counsel of record and to any unrepresented party.  ENTER: February 1, 2017   /s/_________  IRENE C.

http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/suspected-perv-college-professor-found-dead-harlem-home-article-1.2721357,"A professor accused of placing a spy-camera in a bathroom at the college where he worked was found dead in his Harlem home Thursday night, police sources said.
Jackie Conrad, 39, was found in his apartment on Adam Clayton Powell Blvd. near W. 138th St. at about 6 p.m. cops said — just eight days after his arrest on unlawful surveillance charges.
An autopsy will determine his cause of death, but police suspect he killed himself, according to sources.
Conrad, a professor at New York Institute of Technology, planted a camera disguised as a pen in a handicapped-accessible bathroom at the school’s Old Westbury campus in Nassau County on July 13, according to a criminal complaint.
A woman using the bathroom saw the pen — with a blinking green light — sticking out from a ceiling tile, police said.
Conrad admitted to placing the camera, according to the complaint.				
After his arrest, a university spokeswoman told reporters that Conrad, who taught in the school’s anatomy department, was no longer an employee, The Associated Press reported.
Neighbor Jenny Lischer, 39, said Conrad moved into the Harlem apartment about three or four years ago.				
“I ran into him at 3 o’clock, 4 o’clock in the morning and I never got the slightest creepy vibe,” Lischer said. “He was genuine, he was joyous, he cared about people, he had an aura.”

            Everyone just needs to take a cold shower. New York University administrator Stephanie Bonadio claims in a new lawsuit that she lost her job when she accused her boss of sexual harassment. Bonadio says she was given a promotion within NYU’s Schack Institute for Real Estate, but while at dinner discussing it with the dean, James Stuckey, “He grabbed her hand and …without her consent, he forcibly placed her hand on his crotch and his erect penis,” according to the lawsuit. The schools says Bonadio still has her job, but Stuckey, who no longer works for the institution, has had problems like this before. 

  According to the lawsuit, Bonadio reported the incident only to find that her position “no longer existed and there was no specific job at NYU into which she could be placed.” NYU spokesman John Beckman disputes this: “The allegation that the university would punish someone for reporting sexual harassment is entirely false,” he said. “She continues to have a job and we have urged her to return to work.”  Stuckey, on the other hand, does not have a job at the university. Soon after the alleged incident, he resigned from NYU citing “health reasons.” He also quit working for the Bloomberg administration’s Public Design Commission around the same time.

  Four years prior, Stuckey ditched the Atlantic Yards development firm Forest City Ratner Cos. after he allegedly “took all of his subordinates to a club and then called a number of women employees into a private room, where he had them sit on his lap as though he were Santa Claus.” A source told the New York Post, “There’s a pattern of this behavior. He’s a very competent guy, technically speaking. But his historical Achilles heel is this stuff.” Sometimes seeming like a huge creep overrides the talent part.

http://therealdeal.com/2015/06/24/forest-city-must-provide-any-info-on-sexual-harassment-against-former-exec/,"If Forest City Ratner has any information about sexual harassment claims against a former executive, it has to disclose it, a New York state appellate court ruled.
In 2012, Stephanie Bonadio filed a lawsuit against former Forest City exec James Stuckey, who also used to serve as dean of New York University’s Schack Real Estate Institute, claiming he sexually harassed her when the two both worked at NYU.
Now, Bonadio is trying to find out if any Forest City employees ever filed similar complaints against Stuckey, according to Capital New York, and the court agreed that the company has to fork over any information it has. Stuckey abruptly left Forest City in 2007, according to the website.
In the suit, Bonadio claimed her career suffered because of the harassment, the New York Daily News reported at the time. She alleged that Stuckey urged her to perform a sex act, the newspaper reported, and harassed her when she asked about an upcoming promotion. [Capital NY] — Claire Moses

Avital Ronell, lauded as “one of the most original, bold and surprising” thinkers in modern academia, has been banned from teaching for a year following an 11-month investigation. Her former student, 34-year-old Nimrod Reitman, accused Ms Ronell, 66, of physical and verbal harassment during his time at the university. Mr Reitman, who is now a visiting fellow at Harvard, claimed Ms Ronell repeatedly kissed and touched him, slept in his bed with him, demanded he sleep in hers, messaged and called him constantly, and refused to work with him if he failed to reciprocate. According to The New York Times, who saw excerpts of an NYU report into the case, Ms Ronell sent emails to her student in which she called him “my most adored one”, “sweet cuddly Baby”, and “cock-er spaniel”.Ms Ronell, who is a lesbian, told the newspaper her behaviour towards Mr Reitman, now a married gay man, did not constitute harassment. Students at the University of Bristol raise £1,500 for cleaner so he can go to Jamaica with his wife“Our communications — which Reitman now claims constituted sexual harassment — were between two adults, a gay man and a queer woman, who share an Israeli heritage, as well as a penchant for florid and campy communications arising from our common academic backgrounds and sensibilities. “These communications were repeatedly invited, responded to and encouraged by him over a period of three years.” Despite being cleared of sexual assault, stalking and retaliation, the university upheld the complaint against Ms Ronell of sexual harassment.

In March of that year, he told her he was attracted to her, but “they could not act on what was between them” because of “very clear” rules.

The two had sex through all of that April and into May, until the woman revealed the relationship to staff at the college.

The board order also cited unprofessional conduct during a previous incident involving conversations between a female college student and teenage boys Larson was counseling.

He was barred from conducting child custody evaluations in April 2008. The state board in South Dakota had determined that he failed to tell a client, the mother of a child, that he later carried out an evaluation on behalf of the father. The sanction applied in both South Dakota and Minnesota, and it was lifted about 18 months later.

                 The former financial aid director for North Idaho College pleaded guilty Thursday to computer crimes and attempted misuse of public funds related to a scheme to entice students to have sex with him in exchange for college aid.
Joseph M. Bekken, 37, could be sent to prison for up to 7 1/2 years and fined as much as $52,500 when sentenced Oct. 19 in Idaho’s 1st District Court.
The Kootenai County Prosecuting Attorney’s Office said it would not object to concurrent sentences, reducing the maximum jail time to 5 years. District Judge Lansing Haynes noted, however, he could still impose the full 7 1/2-year sentence.
Prosecutors agreed to drop three other felony charges against Bekken: burglary, attempting to procure a prostitute and bribery using scholarship money from NIC’s private nonprofit foundation.
Haynes accepted Bekken’s guilty pleas in a 15-minute hearing. In a quiet voice, Bekken explained to the judge how he took NIC Foundation money and offered it to individuals in exchange for sexual relationships, and how he used the college computer system, including instant messaging, to discuss the inappropriate transfer of funds.
Prosecuting Attorney Barry McHugh declined to comment, prior to sentencing, on his reasoning for the resolution. A presentence investigation will be conducted to review Bekken’s criminal record, specific facts of the crime, employment and social history, and other factors.
“I’m satisfied because we have the freedom to recommend at sentencing what we think is appropriate, whether that’s a prison term or something less than that,” McHugh said.
According to investigators, Bekken first used a Craigslist notice to contact students with an offer of scholarship money in exchange for sexual relations. Police, working with NIC and the FBI, created a false student account under the name “Sheryl Roberts” to respond to the solicitation.
He secured $587 from the foundation for the fictitious student with the understanding he would go to her apartment to have sex with her on Feb. 2. Police confronted and interviewed him, and the college fired Bekken that day.
Bekken was hired in 2010 and was paid $73,720 a year, according to the college. Before that he worked five years at Grand Canyon University in Phoenix. That college said it also had fired Bekken.
Mark Browning, NIC’s vice president for communications and governmental relations, said Thursday the administration had no comment on the plea deal.
Bekken’s attorney, Sean Walsh, was traveling and unavailable for comment.

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2008/06/11/not-our-best-and-brightest,"The missteps in Iraq are well documented by now.
Library shelves could be lined with books that criticize the poorly constructed endgame, the insufficient troop levels and the disbanding of the Iraqi military. There have, however, been glimmers of promise that have gotten a share of ink as well. Among those success stories is the American University of Iraq, a Western-style institution in the war-torn country’s northern region that promises to “lead the transformation of Iraq into a liberal and democratic society.”
The university’s lofty aspirations, as espoused on its Web site, make the selection of its first chancellor all the more puzzling. Owen Cargol, who took the helm at AU-Iraq in 2007 and resigned in late April of this year, had a checkered past that could have been revealed to university organizers with a simple Google search. The sexual harassment scandal that brought down Cargol at Northern Arizona University in 2001 was well publicized, in all of its explicit detail, but apparently never came to the attention of the U.S. officials who trusted Cargol to help reshape the Middle East.
John Agresto, who was hired by the Coalition Provisional Authority to rehabilitate Iraq’s universities from 2003 to 2004, is now AU-Iraq's interim chancellor. Asked about the Cargol hire in an e-mail, Agresto distanced the university from its former chief.
“You should know that Dr. Cargol resigned last month and is no longer at [the university],” Agresto wrote. “We were unaware of any incidents or allegations when he was hired.”
Cargol’s 2001 resignation stemmed from allegations made by a Northern Arizona employee who alleged that Cargol, while naked in a locker room, grabbed the employee’s genitals, the Arizona Republic reported. In a subsequent e-mail to the employee, Cargol described himself as “a rub-your-belly, grab-your-balls, give-you-a-hug, slap-your-back, pull-your-dick, squeeze-your-hand, cheek-your-face, and pat-your-thigh kind of guy.”
Cargol, who at the time was a married father of two children, went on to say that he was a “sensual kind of guy” who hoped the employee could “feel comfortable enough with me (and others) to reciprocate the same level of playfulness and affection,” the newspaper reported.
Cargol's pressured resignation from Northern Arizona came just four months after he was appointed.
Agresto, who was traveling to Iraq Tuesday, did not respond to follow-up questions about the reasons for Cargol’s resignation at AU-Iraq. A spokesman for the university, however, said that Cargol had stepped down April 24 for “personal reasons” and was not in good health.
The spokesman said he didn’t know Cargol’s whereabouts, and efforts to reach Cargol for comment were unsuccessful.
American University of Iraq, which is a private, nonprofit institution, is in part bankrolled with U.S. taxpayer dollars. Congress donated $10.5 million in seed money for the university, The New York Times reported.
Cargol’s April resignation came just a few days before a graduate student at Indiana University at Bloomington wrote a blog item about Cargol's past at Northern Arizona. (The resignation wasn't announced until after the post.)
Jeremy Young, who directs the blog Progressive Historians, knew Cargol’s history well. A native of Flagstaff, Ariz., where Northern Arizona University is located, Young recalls -- with some cringing -- the short-lived Cargol era.
“Mention the name Owen Cargol to a resident of Flagstaff, Arizona -- the sleepy mountain town where I grew up -- and you will be met with a mixture of anger and sadness,” Young wrote. “Tell a Flagstaff resident that Cargol is now the chancellor of a major university in the Middle East, and he or she will probably respond with disbelief. It has been more than seven years since Cargol nearly destroyed the university that is the crown jewel of this city, but the people here have long memories.”
Young, who says he had a morbid curiosity about where Cargol had ended up, learned of Cargol’s new position after conducting a simple Internet search.
“I was like, I wonder where Owen Cargol has gone to? And I (said) ‘oh my God, he’s in The New York Times,’ “ recalled Young, who stumbled across several glowing stories about American University of Iraq that didn't mention Cargol's past.
“This guy resigned in disgrace and almost brought down the university with him, and here he is [working] with a bunch of people I have a lot of respect for,"" Young added.
AU-Iraq, housed in the Kurdish-populated city of Sulaimani, is indeed the brainchild of a star-studded cast of scholars and politicians. Iraqi President Jalal Talabani is chairman of the Board of Regents; and Barham Salih, Iraq’s deputy prime minister, is president of the Board of Trustees. Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. ambassador to Iraq and a counselor to former U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, sits on the board. So too does Fouad Ajami, head of Middle Eastern studies at Johns Hopkins University.
Agresto, the new interim chancellor, brings his own bona fides. As detailed in  Imperial Life in the Emerald City, Agresto has close connections to Rumsfeld and Vice President Dick Cheney’s wife, Lynne Cheney, with whom Agresto served during a stint at the National Endowment for the Humanities. A self-described neoconservative who was “mugged by reality” in Iraq, Agresto “knew next to nothing about Iraq's educational system” when he arrived with orders to rebuild it, The Washington Post reported.
How Agresto and his colleagues came to select Cargol to head AU-Iraq is unclear, but Cargol’s decision to reinvent himself as an administrator in the Middle East preceded his work in Iraq. Before he took the chancellor’s post, Cargol was provost of Abu Dhabi University, a private institution in the United Arab Emirates.
Efforts to reach Abu Dhabi officials were unsuccessful.
Cargol wasn’t a faculty favorite at Northern Arizona, even before his downfall. His highest-level administrative experience prior to coming to Arizona was as president of the University of Maine at Augusta, an institution that faculty in Arizona viewed as insufficiently large and complex to prepare Cargol for the president's post.
Northern Arizona’s Faculty Senate, and a council made up of the chairs of all departments, both objected to Cargol as a candidate. The Board of Regents, however, took a chance on him.
Stan Lindstedt, a professor of biology at Northern Arizona who served on the search committee that chose Cargol, said he thought the regents were snowed by Cargol’s obvious “charisma” -- an intangible quality that would have made him a potentially fine fund raiser.
Asked what he thought of Cargol’s foray into Iraq’s higher education system, Lindstedt said “who in their right mind would do that?”
That said, Lindstedt wasn’t too surprised that Cargol had some appeal as a candidate for AU-Iraq's chancellor -- particularly if his history was unknown to those who hired him.
“It certainly looks like (on paper), here’s someone who has some administrative experiences and could do that job,” Lindstedt said. “So in a sense it’s not terribly surprising.”

                                A Northern Arizona University professor was arrested Oct. 30 and indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury on five counts of felony stalking – one involving a student -- and three counts of giving false information to law enforcement.Melissa Ann Santana, 36, who worked as an associate professor of interior design, is accused of habitually stalking and harassing two firefighters from the U.S. Forest Service hotshot crew in Flagstaff, the wife of one of the firefighters, one of their friends, and an NAU student.The stalking occurred from February 2015 to September 2017 and was largely committed through electronic communication, according to U.S. District Court documents. Santana committed the offenses using “many different identities, email addresses, social media accounts and temporary telephone numbers.”The names of the victims are redacted in the report.Santana was arrested on the NAU campus on Oct. 30 by United States Forest Service law officers. NAU spokeswoman Kimberly Ott said on Monday that Santana was no longer employed at the university but would not comment on her arrest.“The university does not comment on what appears to be an ongoing criminal matter,” Ott said.Hotshots and false statementsSantana met both firefighters through the online dating app Tinder. She met the first firefighter, labeled as N.L. in court documents, in November 2015, where she used the online alias “Ann, 29” according to court documents.N.L. told law enforcement that he had a sexual relationship with the married professor, meeting mostly in her NAU office and his house, until June 2016, when he ended the relationship.The second firefighter, labeled as K.T. in court documents, was matched on Tinder with Santana, also under the alias “Ann, 29” in August 2016 and told her he wanted to meet in September 2016. He told law enforcement that he quickly learned that it was the same person who was harassing his coworker.According to court documents, both men received harassing messages from Santana under multiple false names such as “Laura Towner” and “Kendall Patterson.”The messages, according to the documents, ranged from sentimental, such as a text to N.L. that said “I miss you so much,” to malicious, with Santana telling K.T. to “be like the Granite guys and go die in a fire,” referring to the 19 Granite Mountain Hotshots who died in the Yarnell Hill Fire in 2013.She later sent a message to K.T’s fiancé, under the alias “Kelli Torrence,” claiming that she was having a sexual relationship with K.T.Santana allegedly vandalized one firefighter’s car by keying an expletive into the driver side door and slashing his tires. She also threatened to post another firefighter’s picture online and advertise him for sexual services.In September 2016, Santana sent an email under the name “Cathy McCarthy” to multiple supervisors of the hotshot crew claiming that Flagstaff hotshots raped her 15-year-old daughter while heading to a fire near Rock Springs, Wyoming.Rock Springs Police Department told Forest Service investigators that no Cathy McCarthy lives in the town, according to the federal court’s criminal complaint. Investigators also confirmed that the IP address attached to the email belonged to Santana.The criminal complaint also states that Santana sent a text message using a fake number to the Globe Hotshot Superintendent Dean Whitney on September 2016.The text said, “Can you please tell REDACTED to call me. He won’t return my phone calls, I’m pregnant, it’s his. He needs to take responsibility. Thanks.”She sent the same message to the Flagstaff hotshot crew superintendent.Student harassmentOne NAU student,, whose name was also redacted, told Forest Service investigators that he met Santana through a Craigslist post in 2014 and met her in person for the first time in February 2015. The student told the investigator that “stalking on the NAU Facebook page began about a week later.”The student said he received “harassing phone calls from various unknown numbers, emails and posts on his personal Facebook page.”He said the cyber-harassment also included a “smear campaign” against him that he had sexually transmitted diseases. The student did not mention Santana by name, but the Northern Arizona IP address shows that the computer’s user searched the names of the hotshot firefighters N.L. and K.T as well as their families.Court documents state that the student’s friends were harassed online by Santana under the fake name “Amanda Foster.” One of his friends was fired from her job after “continuous false post and emails that claimed she steals.”The student told investigators that “he confided about being stalked to Santana” and described the former professor as a friend.DetainedUnited States Magistrate Judge Charles R. Pyle ordered Santana to be detained, according to court documents. He denied her release on the grounds that she was a danger to the public and a flight risk due to her use of multiple aliases over three years.The document did not state where Santana is being held.If convicted she faces a maximum sentence of 40 years, according to federal court documents.

https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/breaking/ct-northern-illinois-university-board-meeting-0629-20170628-story.html,"Northern Illinois University, already dealing with the controversial departure of the school's president, found itself this week replacing the dean of its law school, who resigned after an investigation into improper conduct found he violated university policy, according to officials.Eric Dannenmaier, who had been on voluntary administrative leave since February, resigned recently as the dean of the College of Law, officials said. The school's board of trustees, meeting Wednesday in DeKalb, named veteran law school professor Mark Cordes as interim dean.The trustees, as expected, also appointed university Executive Vice President and Provost Lisa Freeman as acting president, starting Saturday. She replaces outgoing President Doug Baker, who resigned following a state report alleging improper spending during his tenure.A spokesman for the school said the investigation into improper workplace conduct by Dannenmaier uncovered a violation of university policy, but the school did not immediately provide specifics. .Dannenmaier, who became dean in June 2016, did not immediately respond to questions about his departure.""Following the completion of the investigation, he opted to resign, citing his desire to see the law school remain focused on its important educational mission and continue his own work in environmental law and policy,"" the university said in a statement.Dannenmaier is expected to continue to work at the university in the Division of Research and Innovation Partnerships.In his resignation letter dated Tuesday, Dannenmaier highlighted his accomplishments, including increasing enrollment in the law school and seeing scores in the state bar exam ""exceed the state average for the first time in years.""Dannenmaier acknowledged that ""for some at the law school, I pushed too far too fast.""In his letter, he recounted being informed of a complaint in February regarding his communication with two temporary staff members whom he hired in the summer of 2016.According to the letter, the two female employees alleged Dannenmaier created a ""hostile work environment,"" but Dannenmaier also noted there was no allegation of ""inappropriate touching"" or ""quid pro quo requests.""He went on to say he was ""highly shocked"" by the allegations and noted a review showed the two employees enjoyed working with him.""I will likely never understand how they could interpret any of my words or actions as creating a hostile work environment or what motivated the complaint months after the communications alleged,"" he wrote in his letter.Baker, who served as NIU president for four years, announced his resignation earlier this month.Baker has denied the state report's assertions — that administrators under his leadership routinely skirted ethics requirements to hire highly paid consultants, covered the consultants' housing and travel expenses, and then kept them on staff for too long at lofty pay levels. But he said he decided to resign because the investigation, which was conducted by the governor's Office of Executive Inspector General, had become a ""significant distraction"" for the university.Freeman on Wednesday said her main focus will be on rebuilding trust.""I assume the acting presidency with eyes wide open and an understanding of the hard work ahead,"" Freeman said. ""This is an inflection point for the university. Job one will be to rebuild trust in our leadership — among our faculty and staff, and across the larger university community.""That's not going to happen with words; it will only happen with actions.""One thing Freeman said she plans to do is post her own travel expenses and reimbursements. She also plans to work with other staff members to help get the word out about what is happening at NIU and keep a careful eye on developments in Springfield and how they will affect the university. But she has said she does not plan to seek the president's job on a permanent basis.The theme and tenor at Wednesday's meeting focused on unity and moving forward, a task board President John Butler said Freeman was able to handle.""This is a time for us to unite in common purpose and move forward, and Dr. Freeman is the right person to lead NIU in that direction,"" Butler said before the board met in closed session to discuss her contract. ""She's already presided over some of the most challenging soul searching this institution has seen as it undertook a large comprehensive effort to examine all academic and administrative programs that make up this university.""He added that Freeman had ""widespread support among NIU constituencies.""Butler also noted the university had undergone an extensive review — interviewing a variety of faculty, staff and others — of Baker's performance in preparation of anticipated contract talks. The findings of that report will be made public by week's end, he said.Baker leaves June 30 and will receive a severance package worth up to $617,500.A DeKalb woman, who also is a student at NIU, is suing the board of trustees in an attempt to block Baker's severance agreement. Her lawsuit contends the board violated the Open Meetings Act by not notifying the public of its intent to vote on the deal and then at the meeting by not allowing the public to comment on the agreement.Butler declined to comment on the lawsuit. NIU spokesman Joe King said the university is reviewing the lawsuit but believed it acted properly at the meeting in question.In appointing Freeman as acting president, board members agreed to a salary of $360,000 annually and deferred compensation of $25,000 for each year she serves as acting president.Butler said the board has not yet decided when to start a search for a new president. However, he said a search likely will take about a year.The board Wednesday also named Christopher McCord as executive vice president and provost to replace Freeman in the interim. He has served as the dean of the university's College of Liberal Arts  Sciences since 2007.Cordes will head the university's law school until a permanent dean can be named. Cordes has served the college of law for 37 years and served as interim dean in 2015-16.Members of the university's advisory committee, which includes faculty and staff, expressed mixed emotions — from frustration to sadness — over Baker's resignation and other developments at the school. However, all focused on moving the university forward.DaywatchWeekdaysStart each day with Chicago Tribune editors' top story picks, delivered to your inbox.""Let's make the most of this new beginning and build trust with the new administration and board members,"" said Holly Nicholson, operating staff council president.She noted a small group of ""negative voices"" have adversely affected the university and lamented that according to a survey, university employees are more likely to discourage students from attending NIU than encourage them to attend. She encouraged fellow faculty and staff to stop the negativity and focus on moving forward.""This has to stop,"" she said. ""Right now the few negative voices are drowning out the positive things happening at NIU ... those negative voices don't speak for all of us, they don't even speak for the majority; not by a long shot.""The inspector general launched the inquiry into Northern Illinois' hiring practices in 2014 following several anonymous tips. Illinois law requires state agencies to publicly bid out contracts for professional services from an independent contractor worth more than $20,000.But the report found that the university hired nine employees between June 2013 and May 2015, paying them all more than $20,000, but never solicited bids for those jobs.In all, investigators wrote, Northern Illinois spent more than $1 million on the five highest-paid of those employees.Fabbre is a freelance reporter.Originally Published: Nov 19, 2017 at 3:20 am"
http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/your-watchdog/2015/02/15/nku-paid-former-worker-avoid-sex-lawsuit/23360623/,"NKU paid former associate athletic director %24200%2C000 in 2013 to avoid sexual harassment lawsuit.Chrissy Soards worked for former  Scott Eaton%2C who was later fired for ethical violations.Eaton had sexual affairs with several NKU workers and at least one adult student.Eaton now serving 10 years for embezzling %24311%2C000 from the school over 4 years.HIGHLAND HEIGHTS – Northern Kentucky University paid the subordinate of convicted embezzler Scott Eaton nearly a quarter of a million dollars two years ago to avoid a potential sexual harassment lawsuit and gained that worker's subsequent silence – the only such settlement NKU reached in the wake of the Eaton scandal, The Enquirer has learned.Former NKU associate athletic director for compliance Chrissy Soards first complained to the school about the behavior of her boss Eaton in early March 2013, school officials acknowledged last week. The Enquirer previously reported that the first phone call about Eaton came in on March 8.On March 16, the school fired Eaton for ethics violations, and two days later, Soards signed the $200,000 settlement agreement. The Enquirer obtained the agreement through a series of open records requests.NKU later discovered Eaton stole $311,000 from NKU using a university-issued credit card, and that he had inappropriate relationships with at least four women on campus, including an adult student.The university has steadfastly refused to identify the women involved, although Board of Regents chairman Dennis Repenning this week acknowledged to The Enquirer that Soards and her attorney had threatened the school with a sexual harassment lawsuit.Repenning also said Soards' initial complaint threatened legal action and was the first sign anything was amiss with Eaton's behavior.""This was the first we had heard about Eaton's activities ... prior to that, we thought he was a Boy Scout,"" said Repenning, an Erlanger-based lawyer. ""He seemed to be everybody's favorite. Once we learned of this activity, this whole house of cards just fell apart.""And I would not accept any characterization that we bought this woman's silence ... that would be incredibly unfair to the individual involved.""Eaton pleaded guilty to felony theft charges in April 2014 and is serving a 10-year sentence in the Campbell County Detention Center in Newport.Soards resigned from the school on March 25, less than two weeks after Eaton was fired. The settlement prohibits Soards from suing the school or helping anyone else sue the school. It was signed on March 18, 2013, and the payments were to be made by April 1, 2013. It also referred to a pre-existing and unrelated workers' compensation case Soards brought against the school. She is still eligible for her retirement benefits through the Kentucky Retirement System.""Soards agrees not to hereafter initiate a lawsuit based on any claims released by her ... be party to such a lawsuit, or in any way assist or cooperate with any other person or entity of any kind or nature against NKU,"" the agreement states. It also requires her not to speak about the agreement and ""not to make any statements or remarks that are disparaging toward"" NKU or anyone at the school.Repenning said the settlement ""was a big deal for us ... this was no drop in the bucket.""""Two hundred thousand bucks is nothing to sneeze at and, as a lawyer myself, that is not a small number,"" Repenning said. ""Look at what she was making and we are talking about three years of her salary and benefits.""NKU settled quickly, now seeks reimbursementAt the time of the settlement, Soards was NKU's athletic compliance officer, making sure the school adhered to all the rules set forth by the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). She started working at the university in 2005, according to her personnel file, also obtained through open records requests.Reporting directly to Eaton, Soards was earning $55,017.96 annually when she left the school. That's 24 percent more than the $44,195.64 Soards earned in 2010, although she received a 13.6 percent boost later in 2010 that was part of a campus-wide pay raise program.Soards declined comment through her attorney Barbara Bonar of Covington, citing the settlement's confidentiality clause. Bonar also declined comment on the case, including when Soards initially threatened a lawsuit against NKU, citing the same confidentiality clause. Bonar also said she had no knowledge of Soards' claim for workers' compensation and that it predated her other legal issues with NKU.""We did not represent her on that case,"" Bonar said.NKU president Geoff Mearns, who approved the final agreement, deferred comment to university spokesman Chris Cole.The settlement was made ""to eliminate any possible distraction or reduction in resources as we investigated the full damage done to the school by Scott Eaton,"" Cole said.The document itself does not list specific issues with the school. Coles declined to say whether Soards was romantically involved with Eaton.""We have released a lot of information about this case but one thing we have remained consistent on is our commitment to respect the privacy of the other individuals involved, so therefore we will not release their names,"" Cole said. ""This is the only settlement agreement that was made in connection with the investigation of Scott Eaton.""After Soards' initial contact in early March 2013, Mearns asked the school's board of regents for guidance, Cole and Repenning said. Mearns then approved the final settlement.""This all happened very quickly ... within a matter of weeks,"" Cole said. He added that the school also was bound by the agreement's confidentialty clause, which he said prohibited NKU from discussing the settlement unless ""bound by law.""Cole also declined to discuss Soards' workers' compensation case, citing privacy laws, saying only that it was unrelated to the Eaton situation.NKU is part of the state public university system, which is funded in part by tuition, student fees and state/federal tax dollars. The school has a budget of about $225 million annually.The school is seeking reimbursement from Eaton as well as its insurance company for both the stolen money and the $200,000 settlement with Soards, Cole said. Like most major public institutions, NKU has an indemnity insurance policy to cover lawsuits, settlements and thefts.""We know that we will recoup some of that settlement from the insurance company, we just don't yet know how much,"" Cole said.Possible violation of open records lawsThe university initially denied The Enquirer access to any documents surrounding Soards or Eaton two years ago, citing the ongoing investigation at the time. Cole, however, said there is no record of any initial specific requests for settlements associated with the case from 2013.NKU again denied access to the agreement when The Enquirer specifically requested any settlements with Soards or others involved with the case in an October 2014 open records request. NKU said the request sought ""forty plus years"" of settlement records, and that it ""places an unreasonable burden"" on the school. The document was produced only after The Enquirer threatened legal action last month to enforce its right to access the public record.""We acknowledge that there was a misinterpretation of the request and once we realized that the request was more narrow than we originally thought, we produced the document within a week,"" Cole said.The Enquirer's Fort Mitchell-based attorney, Lyn Hils Mathews of the firm Graydon Head, said NKU's initial response violated state open records law, but it was unclear if the settlement agreement had been willfully withheld by NKU.""We hope that NKU will put systems in place in the future to allow it to make an efficient and good faith search of its records to provide a complete response to a records request the first time around,"" Mathews said. ""Neither The Enquirer nor the public should be forced to obtain legal counsel just to gain access to non-exempt public records.""Settlement was 'money well spent'Eaton declined visit requests made to him at the Campbell County Detention Center.His actions and the subsequent scandal rocked NKU during Mearns' first year at the school. Repenning said he and other board members wanted to ""move on"" after Eaton was fired for the sexual misconduct. But he credits Mearns for going back and taking a deeper look at the finances of the athletic department.""We obviously thought it was appropriate to terminate him (Eaton), and we were all ready to turn the page,"" Repenning said. ""We thought there was no way in hell that he was actually ripping us off financially. I am so glad Geoff went back and did that review and I think Geoff's handling of this has been pretty good throughout.""In hindsight, this (settlement) was still money well spent and I would do it again under the same circumstance,"" Repenning said.The school has since fired another employee, dance team coach Jennifer Hilvert, also for using school credit cards. Hilvert racked up nearly $7,000 worth of air travel and was fired in June 2014. She has since paid back $5,300 of the $6,800 taken, and NKU did not refer the case for criminal prosecution.Campbell County commonwealth attorney Michelle Snodgrass asked for a follow-up investigation that could result in criminal charges for Hilvert after reading about the case in The Enquirer. Snodgrass declined comment on the ongoing investigation, now being conducted by the NKU police department.In an interview last month, Mearns declined comment on the Hilvert case, including why he didn't turn the case over to prosecutors, citing the current investigation.NKU AND EATON SCANDAL TIMELINEMarch 8, 2013 - Chrissy Soards or her attorney approaches NKU administrators, threatening a possible sexual harassment lawsuit in conjunction with the actions of Scott Eaton.March 16, 2013 - NKU president Geoff Mearns announces the firing of Eaton for ""ethical violations.""

http://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/your-watchdog/2016/05/26/nku-professor-accused-sexual-harassment-twice-yet-kept-teaching/84774204/,"HIGHLAND HEIGHTS - One night after class in 2007, Northern Kentucky University philosophy professor Dennis D. Miller was counseling one of his students who was having trouble in his class.Then Miller put his hand on her knee, kissed her on the cheek and swept her hair back into place while walking to her car, both Miller and the student agreed at the time.She complained to school officials of sexual harassment. In a subsequent meeting with NKU administrators in an office the school, Miller was warned against working with students after class even as he claimed it was innocent affection.In addition, Miller had what he termed a consensual affair with a student sometime in the last decade, he told The Enquirer in an interview. NKU officials did not know of the relationship until told about it by The Enquirer this month. Miller describes it as ""an indiscretion on both our parts.""Then last summer, another of Miller's students made a new sexual harassment complaint. What started as apparent innocuous meetings after class that included other students at a nearby Mexican restaurant turned into texts and instant messaging chats that made the student so uncomfortable that she filed a 19-page complaint against the veteran professor.Yet the result was the same: another meeting with administrators, a strongly-worded note placed in his file warning him against contact with students after class. Those emails and memos came only a few months after Miller landed another contract to teach during the 2015-16 academic year, records show.Miller doesn't dispute the facts from either situation, but said his intentions were misinterpreted both times. Yet he acknowledged he was never seriously punished - and the school declined to answer questions about why he was allowed to keep teaching after the two complaints.School officials confirmed this week that Miller will not be brought back to teach for the upcoming academic year.“I was not terribly surprised (to get the news his contract would not be renewed,” Miller said Thursday. When asked if his non-renewal might be connected to the complaints against him, Miller said ""I will never really know for sure. But there are a lot of other things going on at that school, so who knows?""NKU is in the midst of $8 million in spending cuts, which means up to 100 positions are being eliminated.Miller's contract expired this month after he taught at the school for 27 years. School officials said this week it will not be renewed for the coming year, only after The Enquirer began requesting documents and interviews on the subject. NKU spokeswoman Amanda Nageleisen declined to say whether the complaints or the admission of an affair factored in the decision, citing the confidentiality of personnel decisions.""The University has policies and procedures in place regarding appropriate conduct between students and faculty members, including a consensual relationship policy,"" NKU spokeswoman Amanda Nageleisen said in a statement. ""When a student reports a concern involving a faculty member, we have a process in place by which the matter is addressed promptly and appropriately. We do not condone faculty members abusing their positions of responsibility.""Dennis Miller’s contract has not been renewed for the coming 2016-2017 academic year and he is no longer employed by the University.""Nageleisen declined to answer other questions about Miller or his discipline, citing privacy concerns.The school's human resources and faculty conduct policy allow for an official complaint system for sexual harassment, but leaves the employment or termination of the individual up to the discretion of school officials, with no set guidelines for repeat offenders. Possible punishments include suspension, termination, and even criminal charges.That complaint system includes both an informal and formal process. Miller only faced informal hearings in both cases; both times he was warned to stay away from students after class and faced no other punishment. In short, those complaints resulted only in meetings with department chairs and administrators and memos placed in his file.Nageleisen declined to say why Miller was allowed to return this past year after two separate complaints within nine years.She also declined to say why school officials chose not to pursue a more formal process after initial meetings as outlined in the school's own procedures. Documents from the 2007 complaint show that the woman involved was satisfied with the outcome of no further contact and a written reprimand put in Miller's file. Documents obtained by The Enquirer do not indicate why school officials decided not to escalate the second complaint further.Nageleisen also said the school did not know about the consensual affair that Miller said took place several years ago.NKU's faculty handbook, crafted in 1994, states that such consensual relationships between faculty and students they are teaching ""should be avoided"" but it stops short of banning them entirely.A rash of public instances such as this let many universities nationally to change their policies about relationships between faculty and students over the last decade. That includes Harvard, which forbade any romantic or sexual contact between students and instructors/professors in February 2015, as well as Northwestern University.Other local schools such as the University of Cincinnati, Miami University, and Xavier University have policies similar to NKU's when it comes to sexual harassment, with either Title IX officers or equal opportunity officers put in charge of investigations. Punishments there ranged from censure and suspension to outright termination and possible criminal prosecution. Miami and UC also strongly discourage consensual relationships between faculty and students, but do not outright ban them.One expert says that he advises professors and universities to avoid such contact at all costs, even if it means banning such affairs entirely.""If you’re a professor and engage in a relationship with a student, you're walking down the subway tracks right by the third rail and are only asking for trouble,"" said Daniel L. Prywes, a Washington-based attorney who advises universities in legal cases involving faculty members.Another professor who has studied and written on the subject says that such situations can be fuzzy.""There is a tendency to conflate situations where there is no allegation of harassment and everything was consensual with situations where there were unwelcome sexual advances,"" said Laura Kipnis, a Northwestern University film professor who wrote on the subject last February in The Chronicle of Higher Education after her school banned faculty/student relationships.""And there can be a real rush to judgment in these situations - a lot of schools have been dismissing professors out of hand in he-said, she-said cases, so it's interesting that the professor was allowed to stay (at NKU),"" Kipnis said.This is the second incident regarding sexual misconduct at the school to become public in the last few months. In January, another female student filed a federal lawsuit against NKU accusing the school of improperly handling an alleged sexual assault against her by another student.Instant message about 'margarita Mondays' Miller, 63, is a part-time philosophy professor. Last academic year, he earned about $40,000 and taught about nine classes over the course of a full year. A resident of Alexandria, Miller received a “satisfactory” rating on his most recent performance review.The most recent complaint involved a senior student who has since graduated. In her complaint obtained by The Enquirer, she documents a string of text messages and invitations to dinner as well as veiled attempts to start “a relationship” that started as she took one of Miller's classes in the summer of 2015.Efforts to reach the woman, whose name was redacted from the complaint obtained by The Enquirer, were not successful.Miller acknowledged that he counsels students and routinely stays after class on Mondays, citing a case when he was called to counsel a near-suicidal student by that student’s parents recently.He said that he was helping the woman who filed the complaint “with personal issues,” adding that the woman previously took two of his classes before enrolling again for a third class last summer.Miller said that the woman in the latest complaint had come to him seeking to talk about personal issues, which he said would remain confidential. Miller said he never made any advances toward her.Citing legal and privacy concerns, the school would not supply its own copy of the complaint nor would it verify the authenticity of the complaint obtained by The Enquirer.That 19-page complaint includes screen grabs from text and instant messaging conversations. The woman wrote she had talked to Miller after class one night about personal issues, and even had dinner with him and other students after class at a local Mexican restaurant.But then she states Miller started texting and instant messaging her frequently. She also states that Miller tried to hold her hand and told her that he was “looking for someone to have a relationship with,” and that he kissed her on the cheek several times. In those messages, he stated he missed ""our margarita Mondays.""She also included copies of text messages where she tells Miller that she feels uncomfortable, but he continued to contact her.“Thank you … for everything you brought into my life since I met you,” one message states. “It’s far more than you know and for this I am extremely grateful. I do miss what we lost.”She later writes that Miller’s “manner toward me became increasingly less polite and more hostile in class.”Miller told The Enquirer that “in a different context, I can see how this would look very, very different than it really was. But it was completely innocent.”The complaint eventually resulted in two meetings. One included Miller, the dean of arts and sciences and the philosophy department head. Miller also met separately with the associate dean of students and a director from NKU’s human resources department who also serves as NKU's equal opportunity officer, according to emails separately obtained through an open records request.“They told me to back off the counseling and being open to people, which really goes against my nature,” Miller told The Enquirer. “I was really surprised by that (second complaint) because I felt that everything was innocuous and I was trying to help a troubled student.""“This whole experience has closed me off from a lot of the world.”An affair and ""an uncomfortable hug""It was the second such complaint against Miller in the last 10 years, according to Miller’s personnel file. Miller also acknowledged to The Enquirer having an affair with an unnamed student “several years ago” but said it was consensual and “an indiscretion on both of our parts.”“We remain in touch and are still friends,” said Miller, who is single and who declined to discuss it further.In the previous complaint filed in 2007, another student stated that Miller touched her twice on the knee, gave her an ""uncomfortable hug"" and brushed her hair back after the wind had taken it. Those occurrences also happened after class when Miller was helping the student with coursework.The complaint was only told in person to the associate for the dean of students Steve Meier and not filed in writing. The woman's name was redacted from the memos provided to The Enquirer by NKU.According to those documents, Miller did not dispute what had happened, but that he was just ""being nice"" as he was with all other students.Meier took no official action other than to warn Miller and forbid him from future contact with the student in question""I strongly advised Dennis to keep his distance from all of his students and not to have any personal contact with any student in the future. I further informed him that this issue could have been a lot worse than the outcome requested by (the student),"" Meier said in the memo.Miller told The Enquirer that working with students and counseling them ""is the best part of the job,"" the main reason he kept working with students outside of class.""This just makes me sad as to how things can get so misconstrued,"" Miller said."
https://www.thenortherner.com/news/2018/02/21/after-harassment-complaints-chase-dean-resigned-in-dec-but-could-be-professor-next-fall/,"Chase Law Dean Jeffrey Standen resigned in December after three women, two of them former students, complained of sexual harassment to the university.
The Cincinnati Enquirer first reported on NKU documents showing that three complainants said Standen made them bend over, dance in front of him, rearrange books on high or low shelves while he watched and other demeaning acts.
Provided by Chase Law Chase Law School Dean Jeffrey A. Standen.
NKU Director of Public Relations Anna Wright confirmed Provost Sue Ott Rowlands accepted Standen’s Dec. 8 resignation as dean effective June 1.
Standen has the opportunity to return as a professor under the rules of the faculty handbook (section 1.8.3 on page 20, Appendix A on page 135).
Wright said the university “responded swiftly” to begin investigating based on rumors before the three complainants submitted written statements.
Senior Title IX coordinators Ann James and Rachel Green investigated and conducted interviews in November. Provost Ott Rowlands advised Standen of their findings on Dec. 7; he tendered a resignation the following day.
Wright said the investigation did state an “unhealthy culture of fear, intimidation, and bullying,” but did not uncover “sufficient evidence to support sexual misconduct.”
In reaction to The Enquirer article, Wright said in a statement that “NKU stands by how we handled this matter.”
The Northerner is working to obtain the documents involved in the investigation.
Standen has been on a paid leave of absence since mid-November 2017 and will continue on leave until the end of May.
Standen was named Chase Law dean in March 2013 and succeeded former dean Dennis R. Honabach. Standen taught courses in sports law, gaming law, evidence and remedies.
Prior, he was associate dean for academic affairs and faculty research at Willamette University College of Law. He was a visiting professor and scholar-in-residence at University of San Diego and University of Virginia, respectively.

https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/your-watchdog/2018/04/02/how-sexual-harassment-starts-campus-one-students-story/452882002/,"HIGHLAND HEIGHTS – Her black painted fingernails are chewed to the quick. She fidgets as she recalls the first time she met Randy Pennington.It was spring 2015. Aspiring jazz soprano Natalie Brady was a senior in high school in Milford looking for places to expand her talent. She loved the voices of Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughn and dreamt of singing professionally.A last-minute visit to Northern Kentucky University turned into an impromptu audition with Pennington, the school’s vocal program director.The veteran professor took her back to his cramped office and told her to sit next to him on a small piano bench so he could play while she sang.“It was very close quarters … I just didn’t know what to think,” Brady says, near tears. “It made me feel creepy, but that could have been normal for all I knew.”After all, Pennington seemed to be just like her music director from high school, with whom she had a close relationship.“So I just went with it,” says Brady, who was 17 at the time and is now 20.Brady readily accepted NKU's offer to attend.But those uneasy feelings – and Pennington’s actions – only increased over the coming years.“I’ve since gone back and agonized and analyzed this and I realize that perhaps he targeted me from that very day,” says Brady.“And by the time I realized it, I was already trapped.“I’ve done therapy and a lot of self-analysis and realize I was probably being groomed,” Brady says. ""Now, I just want to ensure that other women know that it is OK for them to stand up for themselves and do something against any individual who is sexually harassing or assaulting them in any way."" -----Last month, nearly three years after Brady’s first encounter with Pennington, NKU announced that the veteran music professor violated the school’s sexual conduct policy. In a March 16 email to faculty and staff, Interim President Gerard St. Armand wrote that Pennington was gone permanently.The decision was the culmination of complaints filed by Brady and four other women – three students and one faculty member – in October, St. Armand said in the email. NKU officials investigated immediately after the complaints were filed, and Pennington was put on unpaid leave. After finding early this year that he had violated the policy, NKU officials began “informal discussions” with him, NKU spokeswoman Anna Wright said. Those discussions are the first step in NKU’s official termination process involving tenured faculty, Wright said.Negotiations resulted in this: NKU officials agreed to let Pennington resign. His official status is ""involuntary resignation,"" Wright said.He will earn his full salary – $73,000 annually – through July and his benefits through June. Pennington, 61, also keeps his retirement benefits, according to the agreement obtained by The Enquirer. Through an open records request, The Enquirer has asked for the complaints from all five women, investigation notes and the final report from NKU. The school has not yet provided the materials.Brady, who gave The Enquirer a copy of her complaint, says she knows the other women. None wanted to publicly discuss Pennington or their complaints.In his email, St. Armand wrote that Pennington had “violated the University’s sexual misconduct policy, specifically, sexual harassment as defined within the policy."" Pennington did not return calls seeking comment. His lawyer, H. Jeffrey Blankenship, issued a statement which explained that Pennington ""denies much of what has been alleged and that a lot of this was taken out of context.""The lawyer was not specific about which allegations his client said did not occur.-----Like many incoming freshmen, Natalie Brady didn’t know many people on the NKU campus, having come from Milford across the river in Ohio.“I just had so much anxiety and insecurity and isolated myself more and more,” she says.So Brady sunk herself into music, spending a lot of time with Pennington in the process.He offered to give her private lessons, something Brady didn't think he did with other students.“He started giving me little talks that would slowly evolve from ‘you're so talented … you need to be confident’ to ‘you’re so talented, you're so much better than everybody else and you’re so sexy and beautiful and you need to hold yourself like that,’"" she says.Soon thereafter, she explains that Pennington became increasingly affectionate with hugs that lingered, kisses on the forehead and wandering hands.He grabbed or slapped her backside at least four times, Brady says, and would ""accidentally"" graze her breasts.“At first, I thought it was an accident as he would do stuff on the piano bench or during hugs and tried to ignore it,” Brady says. “And I didn’t think much of it at first because he’s, like, in his 60s.”“Then it wouldn’t stop even when I told him it made me uncomfortable. He would just laugh it off and call it an accident.”Pennington later started calling her “his ‘go-to’ girl,” Brady says.He would confide in her his feelings about her classmates and his fellow faculty members. Pennington would ask about her love life and criticize new boyfriends.“He would say stuff like I needed to be dating a real man, like him,” Brady says.“But since day one, he has preached to me about how he is the only one at NKU that can do anything for my career, and that I had to trust him. I believed him at first. He kept saying that if I did my time, I would reap the rewards and opportunities.”-----Pennington’s departure is the latest in a string of high-profile case at NKU involving complaints of sexual misbehavior over the last two years.In December, school administrators ruled that former law school dean Jeffrey Standen did not violate the sexual conduct policy after three women complained about his behavior.Investigators did find ""sufficient evidence to support a finding of an unhealthy culture of fear, intimidation and bullying,"" and Standen immediately resigned as dean.Standen is on a paid leave of absence at his full salary of $260,100 and is being allowed to come back to campus in the fall with a 15 percent pay cut. That would put his annual pay $222,000 a year – the highest among all NKU faculty.Last year, the school also settled a separate Title IX lawsuit for nearly $1 million. The female plaintiff sued in 2016 alleging NKU officials allowed a male student to continually harass her, even after he had been found responsible for sexually assaulting her.And in 2015, NKU conducted an extensive investigation into the men's basketball team over possible sexual misconduct by some players. A female student accused three players of sexual assault, but an administrative panel found them not responsible.-----As the months progressed, Pennington gave Brady a key to his office.She found herself running mundane errands for him, as the touching and commentary on her love life stepped up.Even worse for Brady, Pennington manipulated her class schedule so she would be in his formal choir despite the fact she wanted to focus on jazz, she says.And what she calls ""creepy behavior"" only got worse.In texts Brady provided to NKU and The Enquirer, she wrote Pennington she wanted to know “what’s going on in your mind.”Pennington’s response: “You can always ask … remember I have a dirty and weird mind.”Brady says she was always on edge around Pennington, and lost her cool in the spring of 2016.That’s when NKU’s small jazz vocal group had a concert at the cozy York Street Café. The singers dressed in fancy evening wear, including black cocktail dresses.Hers “was pretty low cut and he just couldn’t stop looking and making a fuss and telling me how sexy I was,” Brady says.“I went to the bathroom and cried, and when I came out he said something else and I finally flipped him off.”Pennington also served as the music director at Loveland Presbyterian Church, where he also was an elder.Brady says he hired her to sing there as well, putting her in close contact with his wife.“That was about as weird as you can imagine,” she says.Someone answering the phone at the church declined comment. Brady and her mother, Andrea Brady, say they were told that the church removed Pennington as music director recently.  Brady acknowledges that it may appear to outsiders that she was complicit or wanting attention.After all, why wasn’t she more forceful in rebuffing him or why didn’t she report him? Was she leading him on?She admits to having the same self-doubts.“I felt like I had to stay in touch with him as his student,” Brady says. “But now? Yeah, I feel guilty and like I didn’t do enough to try and stop him.""I kept worrying that somehow that if I went to tell somebody that I was going to be held responsible and not him ... that I egged him on somehow,"" Brady says.“I guess I kind of thought that I was keeping all the other girls safe by keeping his attention on me.”-----Early in her freshman year, Brady confided in her parents what was going on.“And, boy, they were lit up,” Brady says. But both Ed and Andrea Brady say that their daughter was adamant that she handle it herself.That led to many trips through rural Clermont County to talk things through.""We trusted her and knew she would never put herself in a situation where she could be really compromised, but that certainly was a worry,"" says Brady's father.""It wasn't until I saw some of the texts when she was documenting everything for her complaint that I really got angry,"" he says. Andrea Brady explains that she ""knew that chance (of Brady being pressured into sex with Pennington) was very slim, as Nat is extremely savvy, realized what was going on, and would have dropped out sooner than submit.""But I knew it was likely he would push in that direction, and I was worried about the psychological and emotional ramifications of what that would do to her. She was already questioning herself.""-----Last fall, Brady took a class examining feminist punk rock, just at the time that the #MeToo movement erupted all over the country.That got her thinking about her relationship with Pennington and ways out.Then Brady says she asked him for a favor.Her jazz singing mentor, Darmon Meader, was coming to NKU from New York to give a master class, and Brady wanted to sing a duet with him.For that to happen, “‘you’re going to have to give me a lot more than you do now,’” Brady says Pennington told her.There it was – for Brady, as close to an overt proposition for sex as Pennington had ever come.“That’s certainly the way I took it,” Brady says. “I went back to him two days later and told him that’s the way I took it and that it was not acceptable.""Soon after that, another female student approached Brady, saying a mutual friend told her that Brady had complained of Pennington’s behavior.The other student then told a tale that sounded familiar. Needing to stay in touch and asking to keep things private, an increased need for affection. Inappropriate comments and touching.Then she knew she had protected no one.-----Brady and the four other women filed their official complaints on Monday, Oct. 23.That Friday, Pennington was placed on an unpaid leave of absence. An NKU police officer was standing by at his office in the fine arts building just in case as he left campus via another building.“I waved at him as he went by,” Brady says.She says she ""was pretty livid that a lot of people knew about him and didn't do anything but, then again, I didn't do anything for three years.""Now she has several standing singing gigs around the area and even travels occasionally to perform.Brady also has written a children's book about conquering fear.Her honors project is to create a series of six seminars focusing on exposing and preventing sexual assault/harassment on campus and elsewhere.""We've got to find opportunities,"" she says, ""to fix the problem instead of just talking about it."" Enquirer reporter Kate Murphy contributed. "

http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/education/2014/02/northwestern_university_found_professor_peter_ludlow_violated_the_sexual.html,"
          Two years ago a Northwestern University freshman filed an official complaint to the school about superstar philosophy professor Peter Ludlow. Two weeks ago, after what she describes as indifference and inaction on the part of the university, the student sued Northwestern in federal court.

  According to her complaint, the student originally accused Ludlow of getting her drunk, and then kissing and groping her while she blacked out. An internal investigation by Northwestern’s Sexual Harassment Prevention Office found in the student’s favor—Ludlow had broken the school rules that protect against sexual harassment, the university’s committee found. The student hoped he would be fired, or at least disciplined. Instead, she claims, Northwestern stood by ineffectually as Ludlow threatened defamation litigation. While she spiraled into depression and attempted suicide, Ludlow continued to work as a tenured professor with full privileges. And according to the blog Leiter Reports, he’s on his way to another tenured position at Rutgers University—his fourth such position in 12 years.

  
  


  At the heart of the student’s complaint is the allegation that the university violated Title IX, the law that obligates universities to investigate sexual misconduct claims in a timely fashion, and provide an environment free of retaliation against the people who make the claims. The student’s suit alleges that Northwestern acted with “deliberate indifference” by allowing Ludlow to keep teaching, and committed “retaliation” by allowing him to threaten the defamation suit. The filing asks for damages, medical costs related to the assault, and attorney’s fees—and, most importantly, for “proper remedial actions” to be taken regarding Ludlow.

  


  That’s actually what Northwestern seemed to be planning, back when Joan E. Slavin of the Sexual Harassment Prevention Office wrote a letter to the student. Slavin promised that the Sexual Harassment Prevention Office would “work with the [dean’s] office on implementing needed corrective and remedial actions.” Yet, Slavin said, the office “would be unable to provide [the student] with details of disciplinary and corrective actions taken against Professor Ludlow.” Update, Feb. 24, 2014: According to Northwestern’s court filing in response to the students complaint, which was publicized in a press release Friday afternoon after this piece was written, the university took substantial steps: denying Ludlow  a major raise, refusing him an endowed chair, and requiring him to attend sensitivity training. But, according to the statement Ludlow’s attorney gave me, firing him was never an option. “To our knowledge,” she writes, “there has never been any recommendation” that Ludlow be terminated.  


  


  


  Given the certainty in Slavin’s letter, this seems difficult to believe—and appears to be seriously dicey at a school subject to Title IX. It’s not often that details of a sexual harassment case of this nature are even made public. For example, in the recent harassment kerfuffle at the University of Colorado–Boulder’s philosophy department, the accusations remained frustratingly murky. The details in the Northwestern report, by contrast, are disturbingly, vividly specific—as are the university’s findings. And yet, though Northwestern claims it took several substantial measures to discipline Ludlow, according to the student’s complaint, the office never informed her of this, and she continued to encounter him on campus–and to feel threatened with retaliation.*


  


  


  


  Drawn from both the suit and Slavin’s findings, here are the pertinent details of the allegations, which Ludlow vehemently denies (and which remain unproven in a court of law). The student took Ludlow’s Philosophy of Cyberspace course in fall 2011. The following February, after the course ended, she sent him an email about an art event in downtown Chicago that she thought would be relevant to his research. He suggested they attend together. They met at his office, and he gave her a ride.

  During the course of the evening, Ludlow plied her with alcohol, she attests in the lawsuit, even though she was 19. After she got drunk, she claims he made numerous sexual advances, which she resisted—asking, numerous times, to be driven back to school—until she became incapacitated, the filing alleges. At that point, she would have been incapable of consent, according to Northwestern policy. Instead of driving her home, the suit claims, Ludlow took her to his apartment, where she lost consciousness and later woke up in his bed, with his arms around her.* The Sexual Harassment Prevention Office found all of of these allegations credible.

  


  


  Later that week the student told her story to university authorities—first to a history professor, then to a journalism professor, and finally to Slavin. That’s when the internal investigation was launched, with its damning findings that Ludlow had broken the university’s rules.

  


  I’ve had several off-the-record email conversations with the student—a direct, articulate young woman who is now a junior—and I can see why Slavin believed her. After interviewing both the student and Ludlow, Slavin found that he engaged in “unwelcome and inappropriate sexual advances” toward the student, and that “due to heavy consumption of alcohol purchased” for the student by him, she was “unable to offer meaningful consent to this physical touching,” according to the university’s report. (The statement I received from Ludlow’s attorney, Kristin Case, counters that it was the student who “propositioned” Ludlow, who then “refused her advances.” Case declined to comment further on Ludlow’s behalf; Ludlow only communicates with the press through his attorney.)

  


  As his lawyer’s statement makes clear, Ludlow has never been convicted of a crime or found liable in a civil proceeding. Still, Northwestern’s findings raise some pressing questions.

  First, why wasn’t Ludlow’s punishment made clearer to the student? And really, though said punishment was severe, why wasn’t termination an option?* The Sexual Harassment Prevention Office found him in violation of the school’s policy. Why was nothing substantial done as a result of this finding? Was the university influenced by the fact that Ludlow threatened to sue—and does it continue to be, since he has sued multiple media outlets over their reporting on the case?

  


  


  Second, why is the philosophy program at Rutgers apparently taking Ludlow on? Does Rutgers miss former employee Colin McGinn that much? Maybe not, actually. “This was not brought to our attention by either the candidate or his employer,” a Rutgers spokesman told the Daily Northwestern. That’s an unconscionable omission, though not particularly surprising. On the rare occasions that professors with tenure enter the academic job market, they usually don’t tell their current employers, so Northwestern might not have had a chance to give a heads-up. Now that Rutgers knows, will the philosophy department still bring him to campus? Will the university worry that it will be next to be sued if this offer is revoked?

  


  


  Third, why are influential voices in the philosophy community giving Ludlow a pass? University of Chicago professor Brian Leiter, for example, posted on his influential philosophy blog this statement from Ludlow’s attorney, with no corresponding statement from the student’s lawyer, and is cautioning his readers not to jump to conclusions. Sure, that’s always good advice, but what about the public findings of Slavin’s office? Update, Feb. 24, 2014: Brian Leiter, who emailed Slate in response to this story, says that he has not given Ludlow a pass. He writes:

  


  The plaintiff’s attorney did not send me a statement, Ludlow’s attorney did.  (I did not even know who the plaintiff was at this time, since she had not been named in the news reports.)  If the plaintiff’s attorney had sent me a statement, I would have posted it, but for obvious reasons, the plaintiff’s attorney probably concluded that reaching an audience of philosophers was not as important for her.  (Ms. Schuman never bothered to inquire with me about any of this.)  More importantly, and unnoted by Ms. Schuman, I had linked repeatedly and described in detail news articles reporting the plaintiff’s account of Ludlow’s conduct:  the plaintiff’s allegations had been extensively covered on my blog at the point at which Ludlow’s attorney sent me her statement.  I also provided a detailed description of the allegations in the plaintiff’s complaint and, when Northwestern’s answer finally appeared (after the posts Ms. Schuman links to, but before her article appeared), I provided a detailed account of Northwestern’s admissions.


  


  Leiter continues: “At the time I correctly cautioned readers ‘not to jump to conclusions’ (in response to a false statement that Ludlow had ‘sexually assaulted’ the student), the only account of the ‘public findings of Slavin’s office’ were contained in the plaintiff’s complaint, which I had noted at the time.” And he adds: “That sexual harassment is a serious problem in professional philosophy is consistent with responsible and thorough coverage of the allegations in the Title IX lawsuit against Northwestern, which I have provided.”

  


  


  


  Here’s the thing. Providing a remedy for the kind of infractions Ludlow is accused of—unwelcome kissing and touching, getting an underage woman drunk and then failing to respect her wishes—is precisely the purpose of Title IX. Maybe he didn’t do it, but that’s not what the university’s own investigation found. No one goes to jail for this stuff, but that doesn’t mean they should get off with a financial slap on the wrist.* Title IX is meant to complement the criminal justice system. It’s meant to add another layer of protection for students and others in the university.

  


  So what is particularly galling about this case—and why I hope the Northwestern suit continues to receive widespread media attention—is that the internal investigation did what it was supposed to do. Slavin appears to have acted with with due diligence when she found in favor of the student—and yet, something spooked the university into backing off. The public deserves to know what, and universities the country over need to realize that they cannot get away with shirking their Title IX responsibilities. 

  *Correction, Feb. 24, 2014: This article originally misstated that Northwestern did not in any way discipline Ludlow after the school found he had violated its sexual harassment code in his treatment of a student. In fact, Northwestern says, it denied Ludlow  a major raise, refused him an endowed chair, and required him to attend sensitivity training. Ludlow was not fired, however, and he continued to teach with full privileges. This article also misstated that the student’s complaint in court, and the Sexual Harassment Prevention Office’s findings, included the allegation that the student’s blouse was unbuttoned. In fact, the complaint does not make that allegation, and the Sexual Harassment Prevention Office did not address it, finding only that the student was in Ludlow’s bed with his arms around her.

Philosophy Prof. Peter Ludlow resigned Monday from Northwestern following more than a year of legal battles and University findings that he sexually harassed two students, the University announced Tuesday.
Ludlow’s resignation came as the University was taking steps to terminate his employment and a faculty committee was considering his case, University spokesman Al Cubbage said.
“Ludlow’s actions violated University policy and are an affront to the standards and expectations that Northwestern University has for its faculty members,” Cubbage said in a statement. “The University regrets the pain that was caused by his actions.”
Cubbage declined to comment on the situation further Tuesday, saying that he could not give any details about the two instances of sexual harassment.
Ludlow has not taught classes at Northwestern since March 2014.
In the past, Ludlow has denied all allegations of sexual assault. He did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
The University’s findings that Ludlow violated the school’s sexual misconduct policy came to light in February 2014, when a then-Medill junior filed a Title IX lawsuit against NU. The student, who has since graduated, said in the suit the school responded with “deliberate indifference and retaliation” after she told University officials Ludlow sexually assaulted her in 2012. She said Ludlow took her to a downtown Chicago art show in February 2012, bought her alcohol and ignored her repeated requests to return to Evanston, taking her to his apartment where she lost consciousness. The student said she regained consciousness early the next morning in Ludlow’s bed.
A judge sided in November 2014 with the University’s motion to dismiss the case, ruling that NU “took timely, reasonable, and successful measures” in the aftermath of the student’s report. The University had found Ludlow in violation of the school’s sexual misconduct policy and sanctioned him in several ways, including denying him a raise and prohibiting him from having any contact with the student.
The now-graduated student is in the process of appealing her case to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Her lawyers declined to comment on Ludlow’s resignation Tuesday.
The second instance the University found Ludlow in violation of its sexual misconduct policy came to light when Ludlow filed his own Title IX lawsuit against NU in 2014. The suit revealed the University also investigated Ludlow after a philosophy graduate student lodged a complaint in March 2014 that Ludlow had nonconsensual sex with her. The University found Ludlow in violation of its policy because he had “unequal power” in his relationship with the graduate student, according to his lawsuit.
The graduate student did not immediately respond to a request for comment Tuesday.
In February, a federal judge dismissed Ludlow’s lawsuit, which had argued the University invaded his privacy, defamed him and discriminated against him because of his gender during its investigations of him for sexual misconduct.
Shortly after the first lawsuit was filed, Ludlow canceled a class many students had planned to walk out of in protest of his continued employment. He has not taught at NU since.
Jazz Stephens (Weinberg ’15), who helped organize the protest while she was a student, said she participated in roughly 10 protests in response to Ludlow’s employment and general issues related to sexual violence at NU symbolized by the Ludlow case. She said she was surprised when she learned Ludlow had resigned.
“I’m overwhelmed and gratified and symbolically I think it’s a huge victory,” she said. “But I think there’s still a lot to do.”
This story was updated at 12:41 a.m. on Nov. 4 with additional background information and comments from Jazz Stephens.

http://www.oberlin.edu/stupub/ocreview/archives/1997.05.23/year-in-review/lawsuit.html,"Holtzman lawsuit spans both semestersHoltzman lawsuit spans both semestersHoltzman resigns in May after filing suit in Septemberby Sara Foss			Oberlin found itself wrapped up in complicated legal negotiations, internal procedures and courtroom exchanges when Associate Professor of Neuroscience David Holtzman filed a $1 million lawsuit against the College in U.S. District Court in Cleveland in September.    He also filed complaints of misconduct against Neuroscience Program Director Catherine McCormick, former acting dean of the College of Arts and Sciences James Helm and dean of the College of Arts and Sciences Clayton Koppes with the Professional Conduct Review Committee (PCRC).Koppes also filed a complaint of misconduct against Holtzman with the PCRC.The PCRC reviewed the Koppes and Holtzman complaints together(see related story below). In late April Holtzman agreed to resign, ending both the federal court proceedings and the College processes. In an agreement worked out between Holtzman's lawyer, Kirk Perry, and College attorney Michael Frantz, Holtzman dropped all the charges he filed against the College, federal and internal. The College also dropped its charges against Holtzman.  The suit charged that Holtzman was denied equal treatment as an Oberlin College employee because he is Hispanic-American. In the lawsuit, Holtzman says that the alleged discriminatory behavior ""first manifested on or about May of 1996 when plaintiff was approached and asked to resign."" Three hearings on Holtzman's request for a preliminary injunction were held, though no decision was ever rendered. A preliminary injunction would have enabled Holtzman to continue teaching. In September Holtzman filed a request for a temporary restraining order which was denied. The restraining order would have allowed Holtzman to teach classes without interference from the College. Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. wrote, ""The plaintiff did not demonstrate that he was likely to succeed on the merits of his claim, or that the harm he faced was irreparable."" In April, shortly before he resigned, Holtzman filed a second request for a preliminary injunction in Cleveland, charging that the internal College processes had not been followed correctly. This second request was denied. If granted, it would have prevented internal College processes from moving forward.  Holtzman filed his lawsuit following cancellation of his courseload for the semester after complaints of alleged inappropriate physical misconduct, inappropriate sexual misconduct, inappropriate sexual conversation and drug use filed by students and faculty were reviewed by the College Faculty Council (CFC) and the General Faculty Council (GFC) over the summer. Though the GFC voted to suspend Holtzman, President Nancy Dye granted Holtzman a paid leave at his request, and he continued working at the College, pending investigation by the Professional Conduct Review Committee (PCRC). Though complaints had been voiced about Holtzman's conduct since he arrived in Oberlin, the only formal complaint ever filed against Holtzman under Oberlin's sexual offense policy was filed by Christine Hart, in animal caretaker, in 1992. Hart later with withdrew her complaint. Neuroscience Program Director Catherine McCormick met with students who said Holtzman harassed them between 1992 and 1996. In the spring of 1996 Camille Mitchell, sexual offense policy administrator, conducted an investigation of Holtzman's alleged sexual offense policy violations. Since those who claimed Holtzman harassed them were unwilling to come forward and file complaints with their names attached to them, Mitchell found no reason to initiate a formal Sexual Offense Review Committee (SORC) hearing, and submitted a report to then acting dean James Helm, who began his own investigation at that time. In May 1996 Holtzman, as an untenured faculty member in a continuing position, received a positive evaluation from CFC. The letter to Holtzman stated: ""We especially congratulate you on your strong research program and the involvement of students in it. We do expect you to address your department's concerns regarding your interactions with students."" Throughout his career at Oberlin Holtzman received merit pay increases and favorable reviews. Mitchell also spoke to students about Holtzman's conduct. One student, who wished to remain anonymous, said that she filed a page-long report last fall with Mitchell, alleging that Holtzman had sexually harassed her, often visiting her place of employment drunk and repeatedly asking her out on dates. This student said that she told Mitchell she did not want Holtzman to lose his job and agreed to keep her report on file as a back-up, to use if other cases arose.One student testified, when delivering a sworn affidavit, that, ""In the parking lot of one of the bars, Professor Holtzman offered us marijuna and smoked it himself. Afterwards, we went to his apartment where [Holtzman] smoked more marijuana. While at his apartment, Mr. Holtzman touched me inappropriately in front of everyone. I did not consent to his touch and felt uncomfortable by it.""In September Holtzman attended the sections of Neuroscience he was supposed to teach, but the classes were postponed as a result of his presence. Holtzman said he was never  officially informed that he was not teaching. Rather than suspend Holtzman, Dye placed him on paid-leave, agreeing not to levy the suspension if Holtzman agreed not to attend class.   Holtzman said that his classes were cancelled without his consent and his advisees were taken away without his consent. College officials maintained all along that this was not true. Koppes said in September that normal procedures were followed in Holtzman's situation. ""The College procedures call for informal attempts to resolve these kinds of situations,"" Koppes said. ""Informal methods were pursued over the course of several months because we believed these would be helpful to Mr. Holtzman as well as to the College. When these informal methods failed, we moved into a new situation."" Koppes said, ""He was notified [that his teaching would be cancelled] during the informal process.	All parties are relieved that the legal battle is over. ""It is a good and appropriate resoluation and I'm pleased we were able to do it,"" Dye said.Holtzman said, ""My family and I are very happy about the settlement.""The settlement states that Holtzman will receive the rest of his salary and benefits through August, the date when he officially severs ties with the College. As part of the agreement it was also decided which neuroscience equipment belongs to Holtzman and which to the College. Because Holtzman is a federal grant recipient, the College has to make sure it complies with federal laws governing grant money, Frantz said.Copyright © 1997, The Oberlin Review.Volume 125, Number 25,  May 23, 1997Contact Review webmaster with suggestions or comments at ocreview@www.oberlin.edu.Contact Review editorial staff at oreview@oberlin.edu."

              "">A group of former students wrote Holy Cross president Rev. Philip L. Boroughs earlier this month, charging that Christie “is an imminent danger to students on your campus.”“Several of us were sexually abused by Prof. Christie while we were Holy Cross students,” the group wrote in its Aug. 3 letter. “Holy Cross has enabled Prof. Christie’s misconduct, and has a responsibility now to respond to our coming forward as quickly and decisively as possible.”Get The Big To-DoYour guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more.In a statement to the Globe on Thursday, Holy Cross said the college “was informed of allegations of serious misconduct and immediately placed Mr. Christie on administrative leave, in accordance with college policy. Mr. Christie had submitted a letter of resignation, and he will not be returning to the College.”An Oberlin spokesperson referred the Globe to a general statement dated Thursday on the school’s website regarding recent allegations of sexual misconduct against unnamed faculty members. In a Thursday e-mail to Oberlin students, staff, and faculty obtained by the Globe, conservatory dean Andrea Kalyn said the school’s Title IX officer recently received reports that Christie had allegedly violated Oberlin’s sexual misconduct policy.“Professor Christie was informed of these allegations and was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation,” wrote Kalyn. “He has resigned, and no longer teaches at Oberlin.”A Wellesley spokeswoman said the college has “no record of any complaints” against Christie, adding that in 2016 he was classified as an independent contractor there.Christie, 66, did not respond to multiple telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.Christie, who was named International Performer of the Year for 2017 by the American Guild of Organists’ New York City Chapter, has performed with many of the world’s great orchestras during his long career. He has appeared on numerous recordings and has strong ties to the Boston area, where his work with the BSO has been singled out by reviewers in recent years.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the BSO said the orchestra had been unaware of the allegations against Christie, who performed with the orchestra as a freelance musician and has no formal title with the BSO.“The Boston Symphony Orchestra has never had complaints against Mr. Christie,” the statement read. “Mr. Christie is not on the schedule to perform with the BSO this upcoming season, and there are no plans to engage him for future performances with the orchestra.”In multiple interviews with the Globe, former students at Holy Cross and Oberlin described a consistent pattern of sexual harassment by Christie. Some said the organist used his considerable artistic standing to manipulate and cajole students, dangling before them entrance to some of classical music’s most rarefied circles. Former students also described a sexually charged environment that included lewd comments, large amounts of alcohol, and unwanted touching over a period between 1994 and 2017.Two of the former Holy Cross students who signed the letter also described long-term sexual relationships Christie initiated with them as undergraduates. The two men, who were younger than 21 at the time, said the relationships often involved heavy drinking and unprotected sex in a variety of public spaces, including green rooms, concert halls, Christie’s office at Holy Cross, and in and around the pipe organ at the school’s Saint Joseph Memorial Chapel.The Globe confirmed key elements of the former students’ accounts through e-mails, Facebook messages, and interviews with friends and acquaintances who either witnessed the events firsthand or learned of them soon after they occurred.The five signatories to the Holy Cross letter were all recipients of a prestigious organ scholarship at the school, a position that involves assistant duties and close study with Christie, who has served as distinguished artist-in-residence at the school for more than 30 years.The former students said Christie frequently injected sexual topics into conversation and often physically groped them, rubbing their thighs, proffering massages, and grabbing their rear ends.“I also heard descriptions of the size and shape of other men’s penises — other professors, concert organists, and students,” Jeff Wood, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2006 and went on to study with Christie at Oberlin, recalled in a written account of his experiences that he shared with the Globe and the Title IX office at Holy Cross.<div id="""" class=""image | relative margin_bottom_16

        "">Brett Maguire (left), Jake Street, and Sean Redrow, seen at Holy Cross’s Saint Joseph Memorial Chapel, were among five former students to accuse James David Christie. Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffJake Street, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2010 and also went on to study with Christie at Oberlin, said Christie would often discuss his sexual conquests and the sexual anatomies and predilections of others.Street recalled a 2010 trip to Toronto where he and Christie drank heavily, eventually arriving one evening at his mentor’s hotel room.“At some point, my belt and zipper were undone, and my pants were down around my knees,” Street recalled in a written account of his experiences he shared with the Globe. He says he does not remember who removed his pants: “I remember him getting quiet in that moment, and I eventually fled.”Jennifer McPherson, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2013 and previously dated Street, recalled that Street told her about the experience after the Toronto trip.She added that Christie would often press her for information about her own sex life. “If I did not joke with him in return, he would then say I was prudish and should experiment more,” McPherson recalled in a written statement. “Sex was one of his favorite subjects. If I wanted to be a part of Jim’s ‘circle,’ I had to play along.”Wesley Hall, who studied extensively with Christie at Oberlin despite what he called the organist’s repeated unwanted physical contact, put it succinctly: “He’s the best organ teacher in America, and he could destroy your dreams.”Hall, who said he has spoken with the Title IX office at Oberlin, added: “He has asked me at least 10 times in lessons if I wanted to take my shirt off.”Sean Redrow first met Christie when he was an aspiring organist in high school, practicing before a master class with Christie.He was soon taking lessons with Christie, securing the coveted organ scholarship to Holy Cross starting in 1994.The relationship quickly went beyond mere touching at the keyboard, as Christie lavished praise and affection on his young student, telling him he was a rare talent and giving him a glimpse of life as a musician of international renown: “money, power . . . the College job at the school I loved more than anyplace or anything ever. He said he’d give it to me when he retired,” recalled Redrow in a written statement. “I would have to be prepared to give up all of my connections to family and friends because being an artist of my caliber would require frequent travel and/or moving to different parts of the country and globe in order to live up to my gift.”Redrow said the relationship soon turned sexual and involved heavy drinking. “We’d have some drinks, or wine, and then we would have sex,” said Redrow, adding that some of the episodes occurred at the home of Christie, who then lived in Newton.In one episode, Redrow recalled he and Christie were helping tune the organ at the Holy Cross chapel.“He took his penis out of his pants, started stroking it, and saying, ‘Come on,’ ” recalled Redrow, who said his professor was urging him to perform fellatio.Brett Maguire, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2002 and went on to study with his mentor at Oberlin, said Christie told him about the episode with Redrow in the organ loft.Maguire explained that the first gay sexual experience of his own life was with Christie, initiated by his teacher.“Christie has amazing artistic privilege . . . at Holy Cross to hand select from the most talented young organ students, to groom them as he sees fit,” Maguire said in a statement. “He has abused this position, using his power of selection to surround himself with insecure young men — teenagers — to satisfy his sexual appetites.”Malcolm Gay can be reached at malcolm.gay@globe.com.

https://oberlinreview.org/16554/news/oberlin-professors-resign-after-sexual-misconduct/,"Two Oberlin Conservatory professors resigned last month following allegations of repeated sexual misconduct involving students. World-renowned organist James David Christie, chair of the Organ Department, and Robin Eubanks, associate professor of Jazz Trombone and Jazz Composition, were accused of violating Oberlin’s Sexual Misconduct Policy after Oberlin’s Title IX office received reports against both men.
Dean of the Conservatory Andrea Kalyn notified Conservatory staff and students of the accusations and subsequent resignations in an email Aug. 23, stating, “The work of Oberlin College and Conservatory is predicated on the principles of respect, equity, and inclusion; these are core to our daily endeavor and critical to the wellbeing of our community.”
Christie’s case expanded in the nationial news and had drawn worldwide attention.
The email came just days after the Organ Department was notified of Christie’s resignation. The initial email did not include any information as to why the revered professor was leaving unexpectedly.
Within hours of Christie’s resignation announcement, The Boston Globe published an investigation into Christie’s relationship with students at Oberlin and another institution, the College of the Holy Cross, in Worcester, MA, where Christie was a former faculty member. While the accusations regarding behavior at Oberlin were not criminal, those described by the Globe were more severe.
Christie was an influential and powerful member of Oberlin’s Organ Department and the organ world at large. Christie performed as Wellesley’s organist and with the Boston Symphony for decades. He performs nearly 60 times a year — far more frequently than the average organist.
“He was the ultimate teacher,” said Conservatory sophomore Matthew Dion, a former student of Christie’s. “He’s regarded as probably one of the world’s most amazing pedagogues and performers. He did everything.”
“If [Oberlin] is in the top 15 conservatories in the U.S., it’s number one in organ. And in nearly the entire world,” added Conservatory junior Tigran Buniatyan, another former student of Christie’s. Originally from Armenia, Buniatyan is a trained musicologist and was working as a professional organist when he was offered a spot in Christie’s studio. “I left everything to study with him. I never thought I could go study here. I was 25 or 24, and then there’s probably the only person in the world who could just say he’s taking me to his class and I would drop everything.”
Dion said that Christie had a history of blurring crucial boundaries with students, with a reputation for involving himself in almost every aspect of his student’s lives — from music to housing arrangements.
“The thing with Jim [Christie] was he was a teacher, but he was also a friend,” Dion said.
“It was hard to separate the two when he got too involved,” Buniatyan added.
Conservatory students often rely on their mentors to help secure a future in the industry. At Oberlin Conservatory, and in classical music conservatories across the world, students meet with their teacher every week for several hours of individualized attention and small class work.
“In music, you have this person that’s guiding you not just technically, but also teaching you to express yourself,” said double-degree senior and pianist Natasha Gwirceman. “You’re given this instrument and you have to express all the feelings of life and love and passion and sex and death and everything, and this person is there to teach you that when you’re 18. Christie is the best organist in the country. If you study with him, he could make your career. As an undergraduate, this guy could set you up for life.”
For many Conservatory students, it was a struggle to reconcile the professor they knew with the predator depicted in The Boston Globe article and victim accounts.
“He gave me everything. He gave me the opportunity to come to Oberlin. Of course, I earned it by working hard and practicing. But he gave me the opportunity and the chance to do something with my life in this field,” Dion said. “It was probably one of the most transformative years of my life.”
“The biggest struggle for me over the last two weeks has been to try to separate the man that I knew with the man who did the things that he did,” Dion continued.
Both Dion and Buniatyan expressed frustration over what they see as the destruction of Christie’s legacy in light of the allegations.
“He’s still the greatest organist in the entire [country], I think. People are taking that away from him, but they can’t take that away. It doesn’t have anything to do with anything. I mean, if he’s a great organist, he’s still a great organist,” said Buniatyan
“This guy went from being the greatest teacher in the world to nothing,” Dion added.
Conservatory students often develop a strong bond with their professors and are reliant on their guidance.
“Our work within the Conservatory is particularly dependent on a culture of trust, which is the foundation of every studio and classroom interaction, every ensemble, every artistic and intellectual risk, and certainly every performance,” said Kalyn in a school-wide email.
“As dean, I take most seriously the responsibility to provide our students with a safe and inclusive learning environment, free from harassment and discrimination, as the relationship between student and teacher is a sacred trust that must be honored, protected, and upheld if we are to execute our fundamental educational mission,” Kalyn said.
President Carmen Ambar similarly reinforced these values in an email.
“All of us at Oberlin remain committed to a fair, unbiased, and exhaustive search for the facts,” she wrote. “And we insist that all members of the Oberlin community — especially those who wield power and influence — live up to the highest standards of integrity.”
In light of the allegations, the Conservatory will be requiring all faculty and staff to attend Title IX trainings by fall break.
“All conservatory faculty and staff will have completed required Title IX training by fall break, the Conservatory Division Directors and Conservatory Faculty Council have voted to require that all studio and office windows be unobstructed, and conversations have started about how we can better create a community where professional misconduct does not occur,” Kalyn said.
Oberlin Conservatory, with far more access to Title IX and other support resources than many conservatories because of its connection to the College, is in a unique position to set a precedent for others to follow in the response to allegations of this nature.
The new developments have made some Conservatory students look into the relationship between power and abuse.
“Anytime there’s one individual who can make or break your career,” Gwirceman said, “it seems like the perfect place for [abuse]. You have this very intimate relationship with this person because they are your mentor. They are a god, and they make you as a musician.”

http://www.nydailynews.com/news/crime/ex-ohio-st-marching-band-instructor-accused-rape-3-years-article-1.2692849,"A former Ohio State University marching band instructor accused of raping a female student apologized to his victim in court on Wednesday as he was hit with a three-year prison sentence.
Stewart Kitchen, 29, will have to register as a sex offender after pleading guilty to sexual battery in Franklin County court.

Stewart Kitchen in a Franklin County courtroom.
The woman said the drum major instructor assaulted her at his Columbus home last year despite her saying no and pleading with him to stop.
Kitchen had gone out drinking, and she had met him only in hope of discussing summer practice, noting that she had no more than one drink but was “frozen in fear.”
“I said ‘no,'” she said. “No means no. I said, ‘Take me home.’ That means take me home. … I said, ‘Do not have sex with me.'”

Kitchen pleaded guilty Wednesday to sexual battery.
She said she later left Ohio State with a damaged sense of safety and self-confidence.				
Kitchen had been offering private lessons for years, but started working as an instructor in 2014. The judge said Kitchen will be on parole for five years when his prison term expires.
“I am sorry, I truly am,” Kitchen said in court to the woman, who didn’t acknowledge him. “I didn’t mean to put you through that.”				
The self-proclaimed “Best Damn Band in the Land” has suffered hits to its reputation over the last few years. A decades-long history of sexual harassment surfaced two years ago, with the band director getting fired as a result.

					Ohio State professor Loren E. Babcock has conducted geologic research in Antarctica, China and various other countries.
Supervisors have ranked Babcock in the “top quartile” of the geological sciences faculty. He has authored dozens of scholarly articles and books, including an acclaimed textbook.
Babcock’s work “reflects your national and international prominence in the field,” department chair Frank Schwartz wrote in September 2005.
But on Jan. 3, 2008, the tectonic plates shifted, and Babcock’s career began to crumble. During an argument in his office, former research assistant Lara Ford threatened to tell Babcock’s boss about their on-again-off-again romantic relationship and said, “We’ll see who gets their ass handed to them.”
Ford was in his class in 2004. Babcock gave her a gift — a trilobite, a fossil familiar to those in their shared field. In the next few years, the relationship evolved. It eventually ended with competing sexual harassment complaints with OSU’s Human Resources office, and finally a lawsuit.
In January, Babcock sued OSU, contending that the university mishandled an investigation into his complaints and leaked defamatory information about him that ruined his career.
In February court filings, the university contended that some of what Babcock alleges is false and that the university simply can’t be held responsible for other claims. OSU told the judge the case should be dismissed.
In 2004, Ford became a research assistant for Babcock on a project at the Byrd Polar Research Center. During that time, they began to share details about their personal lives.
In September 2004, Ford’s job ended, and their relationship became social. For example, although he was married at the time, they traveled together to Cincinnati for a Christmas party.
In January 2005, they attended a conference in New Orleans, where Babcock was a presenter. The evening before the conference started, they had dinner, drinks and went to jazz clubs.
Afterward, according to statements both gave to university investigators in 2008, Ford wanted Babcock to see to it that she return safely to her hotel room.
In her statement, Ford said they had consensual sex.
“We had sex that night, and I stayed in his room the rest of the weekend.”
In his statement, Babcock said he wasn’t sure they had sex.
“I returned to my room alone, washed my face, and took an Ambien to settle my nerves after the unnerving experience in [Ford’s] room,” he said.
Babcock said Ford then came to his room, and he told her to leave.
Then, because of jet lag from his recent London trip and the effect of the Ambien, “I started to feel dizzy, and that’s the last thing I remember. I had blacked out,” he said. “I woke up in the early morning [Monday, January 24, 2005] with my clothes on.”Babcock said that in the morning, Ford appeared at his room and claimed they had sex the night before.
“If that is true, and I’m not sure it is, I have no memory of it,” Babcock said in his statement. “Certainly I was in no condition to have given consent.”
Babcock said he sensed on the flight home that Ford had forced herself on him and began harassing him afterward. She demanded a sexual relationship and threatened to derail his career.
From that point, the stories began to diverge, and the relationship became more and more unstable until the he-said, she-said verbal exchange encrusted the truth like sediment on a fossil.
He said, I drove her to her car and pecked her cheek.
She said, he kissed me on the lips and cried about his family problems.
He said, I never asked her for sex, she’s lying.
She said, he was often late for class because he wanted sex beforehand.
He said, the red robe from China was a common gift.
She said, it was a sexy negligee in red, his favorite color.
He said, not true — blue is my favorite color.
And on and on.
About the events in New Orleans, Ford said she was devastated at losing her virginity and for the damage she had done to Babcock’s family.
“I was so psychologically disturbed by what I had done to his wife and his child that I told him we shouldn’t see each other again,” she said in her statement.
Babcock said otherwise. “She had been chasing me mercilessly for months, never taking ‘no’ for an answer,” he said.
In another he-said, she-said volley, Babcock and Ford gave wildly different accounts of the same conversation.
Prior to visiting her family, Babcock heard Ford say, “Don’t be surprised if I don’t kill you.”
Her version is that she said in a humorous way, “My family might kill you,” because they didn’t approve of the relationship.
According to Babcock’s statement, in July 2007, Ford went to his office in Mendenhall Lab and physically assaulted him, then said, “I’ll go to Schwartz.”
Babcock countered, “I’ll file a sexual harassment complaint with OSU.”
Despite the troubled relationship, they saw each other socially many times. Babcock gave Ford gifts from his travel overseas, including a bottle of Chardonnay from Australia, six wine glasses to go with it, a Diana Krall CD and the infamous piece of red clothing.
Babcock’s divorce, angry e-mails, phone messages and assorted events disputed by both parties further eroded the relationship.
After the 2008 confrontation in his office, Babcock formally complained to the Office of Human Resources on Jan. 17. In his statement, Babcock mentioned Ford’s depressed state and erratic behavior.
“I’ve never seen a human being so out of control,” he said.
A second Human Resource meeting occurred on March 11. Human Resources advised Babcock to file a complaint with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission, a standard procedure in such cases. That complaint, filed July 1, was dismissed for lack of evidence.
Babcock’s attorney, John Sherrod, wrote in an e-mail, “The OCRC dismissed it bc the evidence available at the time was heavily slanted toward Oh. State.”
In November 2009, Babcock sent an e-mail to President E. Gordon Gee, saying that he was prepared to sue the university, but “I would much rather see the matter disappear.”
Babcock told Gee he wanted an apology, compensation for his expenses and lost income, inaccurate information removed from his personnel file and “reasonable assurance that the university will never persecute an innocent person again.”
Gee never responded.
In an interview with The Lantern, Babcock said that, following consistently high approval ratings, his performance reviews took a nosedive, colleagues shunned him and the department stopped using his textbooks. All this hurt him financially.
Sherrod said in an e-mail that OSU shared Babcock’s statement with Ford before she gave hers, giving her an advantage.
“Ford’s allegation was based in part on the statements made in [Babcock’s] deposition,” Sherrod said. “This implies that a member of the university’s investigative committee furnished Ford with the plaintiff’s allegation, and then allowed Ford to craft her statement based on information in that initial statement.”
Sherrod also contends that OSU misplaced or destroyed documents and ignored his client’s complaint. He stressed that OSU never concluded that Babcock had done anything wrong.
Babcock said the way OSU handled the case has made him “an outcast,” and that he has suffered “a tangible job detriment.” He claims someone in Human Resources leaked false accounts that he “engaged in sexual acts with Ford on the Ohio State campus, and in public places.”
Jim Lynch, OSU director of Media Relations, wrote in an e-mail that the university doesn’t discuss ongoing litigation.
“As you can see from the 100-plus pages provided to The Lantern on this subject, the university has taken extensive steps to investigate this matter,” Lynch said.
In a follow-up phone interview, Lynch said, “The detailed Human Resources investigation provided to you should provide more than enough information on what the university analyzed, and what we were able to determine.”
Sherrod wrote in an e-mail that “the case is essentially just getting started.”
Despite repeated efforts to contact Ford and some of her family members, she could not be reached for comment.

http://dailynorthwestern.com/2015/05/05/campus/lost-in-transition-northwestern-visiting-professors-past-raises-questions-about-hiring-process/,"
An Ohio State University investigator found last year the then-chair of the university’s English department had “created a hostile work environment” that made female administrative staff feel “harassed and intimidated.”
That English professor, Sebastian Knowles, is now a visiting professor at Northwestern for Spring Quarter 2015.
A series of interviews conducted by the investigator with department staff painted Knowles as “volatile” and described violations of Ohio State’s policies on sexual harassment and workplace violence. The investigator found Knowles threatened and intimidated department staff. According to the report, staff said he initiated “inappropriate and unwelcome physical contact” and made “inappropriate comments of a sexual nature” on several occasions.
Knowles refutes these claims and any wrongdoing. In a written rebuttal, he admits to losing his temper and cursing at staff, but attributes this to stress brought on by an illness. He denies making sexual comments, claiming they were taken out of context, and said the staff members themselves initiated inappropriate sexual remarks.
NU said it was unaware of the allegations against Knowles but will review the matter. In interviews, NU administrators said it’s difficult to learn professors’ past disciplinary records in a hiring process complicated by privacy laws and heavily focused on candidates’ academic merit.
“If someone misbehaves at some institution, there are not good mechanisms for communicating that,” said mathematics Prof. John Franks, the Weinberg senior associate dean for faculty. “That information is usually completely private.”
The issue extends beyond NU. Administrators and experts who study campus safety say it’s a widespread problem caused by a lack of methods for colleges to vet candidates beyond their resumes, writing samples and reference letters. Schools communicate very little during the hiring process.
“Frankly, some of those people who are causing trouble for the department — department chairs or deans want to get rid of them,” said John D. Foubert, an Oklahoma State University professor of higher education who studies campus sexual assault.
“There’s a practice among some people,” he said. “They call it, ‘Pass the trash.’”
The Ohio State investigation
During Knowles’ time as department chair, an administrative staff member hesitated when he asked her to increase a co-worker’s salary, according to Ohio State’s investigation report. Knowles slammed his fist on the desk, grabbed a paper from the woman and told her to “shut up and listen.”
Just 10 minutes later, he was back in the woman’s office apologizing, the investigator wrote in the report, which The Daily obtained from Ohio State’s public records office.
“I love you,” the woman recounted Knowles saying. “I love you. I love you. I’m so sorry for yelling at you.”
Knowles put his arm around her and, according to the report, pulled her close and said, “We just need to hug. I’m so sorry.”
The report described Knowles’ interactions with female administrative staff who worked for him during his time as chair. The two women mentioned in the report declined to speak with The Daily for this story, but their interviews for the investigation give a detailed account of Knowles’ misconduct.
The women reported Knowles repeatedly made them upset and uncomfortable. One woman described a pattern of “volatile outbursts,” followed by apologies and gifts, including $300. Staff reported to the investigator “multiple incidents of unwanted physical contact.”
In an official written response to the allegations, Knowles said claims of unwanted touching and comments from one administrative staff member could be “simply rebutted” because she once gave him a hug and made a comment about ejaculation. According to the report, Knowles told the investigator the staff member said the word “self-ejaculation” when it appeared while she was using a spell checker.
One woman said Knowles compared his feelings seeing her stretch to the way he feels when seeing his wife in the bathtub.
Knowles wrote in his rebuttal that this was an attempt to explain he found the situation “awkward” and wanted to avert his gaze.
The investigator found Knowles “repeatedly initiated physical contact, including hugging and kissing, with female staff members,” who reported the behavior to be unwanted “in every instance.” Knowles acknowledged this conduct but denied the behaviors had any “sexual motivation” and told the investigator no bodily fluids were exchanged.
In his findings, the investigator noted Knowles’ response to the claims indicated a failure to understand what behaviors constitute sexual harassment.
Knowles told The Daily he did nothing wrong and declined to comment further on the investigation, deferring to his written rebuttal. He wrote in the rebuttal he was not given a chance to resolve the complaint internally. The university’s guidelines on harassment investigations say a supervisor should decide if the matter can be handled in the department or if Ohio State’s human resources office should investigate. He also complained the investigator failed to take into account “severe mental stress” brought on by personal illness and his mother’s health problems.
Although Knowles told the investigator the two women made sexual comments, the investigator found those claims to be unsubstantiated.
Knowles agreed on Dec. 12, 2013 to take a voluntary leave from his position as chair. He was permitted to continue teaching during the 2014 spring semester because the misconduct concerned his role as department chair, not as a professor, according to the report.
Throughout his career, Knowles has garnered a slew of teaching awards. An Irish literature scholar, he is the president of the International James Joyce Foundation and the editor of a book series on James Joyce.
Ohio State began investigating Knowles’ conduct in mid-December 2013 and issued the final case report in February 2014. The two women mentioned in the investigation moved to work in different departments at the university.
The investigator wrote in his conclusions Ohio State will take “appropriate corrective action” against Knowles based on the policy violations but did not suggest any specific actions. He also noted Knowles would benefit from sexual harassment training.
The investigation file and subsequent interviews with professors in the English department made clear that top officials from Ohio State were familiar with complaints about Knowles’ behavior.
In a March 2014 meeting, administrators asked English department faculty and staff to act professionally toward Knowles and welcome him back, said Ohio State English Prof. Koritha Mitchell. It was a request some in the department found to be a dismissive approach to sexual harassment claims, she said.
Professors at the meeting said administrators told the department the file could be requested from the university’s public records office. Under Ohio’s Public Records Act, anyone can request a record from a public office, including a state university.
Hiring at NU 
Knowles will be at NU for Spring Quarter only. He is the Carole and Gordon Segal Visiting Professor of Irish Literature, a position endowed by the alumni couple who co-founded the furniture store Crate  Barrel.
The selection process for the position is less intensive than for a full-time professor and the candidate pool is smaller, limited to those who specialize in Irish literature. NU invites scholars to the position after a department subcommittee nominates candidates, said English and Communication Prof. Susan Manning, a former chair of NU’s English department.
Prof. Laurie Shannon, current chair of the English department, did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
Knowles, who spoke to The Daily about the hiring process but not the investigation, said he was first asked about the position six years ago. He wasn’t available then, but when asked again last year, he submitted a resume with references. The Weinberg dean sent a letter offering him the position about six weeks later, he said.
The typical hiring process for a tenure-track professor, both for the English department and for the rest of the Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, is more thorough. Candidates submit an application letter, a research statement, a description of their teaching philosophy and letters of recommendation, said Franks, the Weinberg senior associate dean for faculty. Applicants are first reviewed by a hiring committee then by the department. Top candidates visit campus to interview, meet with faculty and may give a lecture on their area of expertise.
After department faculty vote, final hiring decisions are made by the dean of the school and then the provost. Each school at NU has slight variations in the hiring process, but most follow this model, said SESP Prof. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale, associate provost for faculty.
NU administrators said it’s not common practice for the University to ask for personnel files or disciplinary records of candidates. University spokesman Al Cubbage said NU did not know of Knowles’ policy violations at Ohio State before offering him the position.
Depending on the state, parts of a personnel file, including disciplinary records, may be protected by privacy laws. For public institutions, NU could, in some cases, submit a request under a state’s open record laws. But faculty often don’t want their employers to know they are contemplating a move and NU faculty searches are kept confidential, Provost Daniel Linzer said.
Most of Weinberg’s new hires are Ph.D. or postdoctoral students who have not held faculty positions before, Franks said.
But for those coming from other universities, Franks said NU hopes letters reveal any sexual misconduct or disciplinary infractions. The University sometimes solicits additional reference letters from experts in the candidate’s field. He said Weinberg has on some occasions asked for a personnel file for a potential senior hire if they detect “a cause for concern.”
For the English department, Manning also said references are important but department staff also rely on “intuition and judgment” when evaluating a new hire.
“There is a sense of professionalism where we do assume that if someone comes recommended by six of our colleagues in the field,” she said, “we are not assuming we’re hiring people that have a past that is covered up.”
A bigger problem 
NU is not the only school to unknowingly hire a professor accused of misconduct.
In May 2014, Loyola University Chicago found itself in a similar situation after it hired Miguel H. Díaz, a former U.S. ambassador to the Vatican who previously taught at the University of Dayton in Ohio.
While Díaz was at Dayton, an investigation conducted by outside counsel found he likely engaged in “unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature” toward a married couple who worked with him at the Catholic university, according to a letter obtained by the website Inside Higher Ed.
The confidential letter from the provost to the married couple acknowledged the couple’s concerns that Díaz had sexually harassed them through “various requests and references to explicitly sexual feelings” even after being told to stop.
Though it was sent in July 2013, the letter was not made public until May 2014, after Díaz had already made plans to leave Dayton for Loyola. After the sexual harassment accusations came to light, Inside Higher Ed reported Loyola reviewed the allegations against Díaz and ultimately decided not to withdraw their offer. He became a professor at Loyola last year.
Controversies surrounding University of Illinois Prof. James Kilgore, a convicted criminal who was involved with a 1975 bank robbery that left one person dead, and Pennsylvania State University’s Jerry Sandusky have sparked conversation of faculty background checks.
After Sandusky, an assistant football coach, was found guilty of sexually abusing young boys — some on Penn State’s campus — the university began conducting background checks on new hires and on volunteers who work with children. Other Big Ten universities, including the University of Michigan and the University of Illinois, followed suit with similar policies.
Linzer said NU does background checks on some hires, but the process is too complicated to replicate for every new hire. Some information that appears in background checks is sensitive, and NU may not want to distribute it to the hiring committee. The University also has to give professors a chance to respond to findings, which can slow the hiring process, Linzer said. It also puts NU in the position of deciding a fair system for what kind of infraction would invalidate a candidate.
“If a potential faculty member was caught smoking marijuana as an undergraduate,” Linzer said, “is that grounds for saying you’re not eligible for a faculty position? … The question is where do you draw the line?”
Other occupations incorporate background checks into the hiring process. Some states require checks in professions ranging from teachers to school bus drivers to mortgage salesmen.
Although background checks can pick up criminal infractions and lawsuits filed against a candidate, violations of university sexual misconduct policies would not surface. That information can usually be provided only by the university or the candidate.
A flaw in the system 
For a student trying to transfer to another university or matriculate to a graduate school, it’s much harder to hide a violation of a sexual misconduct policy. Many applications, including The Common Application, ask students to authorize another institution to access their transcript and some student conduct information from a former school.
NU receives several hundred requests for student conduct records from other universities students have applied to transfer to or attend, said Dean of Students Todd Adams.
NU will reveal student conduct issues only if the violation resulted in a suspension, expulsion or exclusion from certain University privileges and activities, Adams said. If a student received one of these disciplinary sanctions, NU will report that to the inquiring university along with the policy the student breached.
Adams said this is a common practice nationwide. In its guidelines for handling allegations of sexual misconduct, the Association for Student Conduct Administration recommends universities indicate suspensions or expulsions on a student’s transcript to ensure any future institution the student attends is aware of any behavioral issues.
But professors typically aren’t subject to this level of scrutiny and don’t have common, transcript-like documents they are required to show when applying for new teaching positions.
A personnel record is the common thread among all professors who transfer from one university to another. State laws vary in how much information from these files universities or other agencies can disclose. In some states, these disciplinary records are completely confidential and protected even from open records law requests. The Illinois Personnel Record Review Act, however, has a provision that allows employers to disclose to a third party a “disciplinary report, letter of reprimand, or other disciplinary action” that is less than four years old if they notify the employee.
Cubbage said the University is aware of the law but, as a matter of practice, does not disclose any information about employees except the dates of employment and the position held.
“We would never share a faculty member’s personnel file with another institution unless required to do so by a court,” Franks said.
It’s not a practice unique to NU. Schools do not typically communicate with one another during the hiring process or ask for disciplinary records. However, even if the practice were common, experts in campus safety and employment law say there are multiple deterrents to disclosure.
Schools may choose not to reveal misconduct findings to a third party because it could open them up to lawsuits from professors who want to challenge the validity of a school’s investigation processes, said Aaron Maduff, a Chicago employment lawyer. A university could spend months tied up in costly litigation.
Disclosing records makes it hard for a university to keep the results discreet, said Esther Seitz, an Illinois lawyer knowledgeable in public records law. If a private university sends employee disciplinary files to a state school, those records then become part of that school’s file and can be requested by anyone under state open record laws.
Then there are schools that have a problematic professor with tenure. Telling another institution about faculty members’ misconduct could mean they won’t leave their current post, said Foubert, the Oklahoma State higher education professor.
But in states with strong open record laws, there is often nothing legally stopping a university from checking a professor’s past disciplinary record. And none of the reasons to keep sexual misconduct findings secret are more important than protecting students, said sociology Prof. Laura Beth Nielsen, NU’s director of legal studies.
“We could take a more assertive role in vetting incoming professors by asking for these records in states where we’re allowed,” she said. “So then why aren’t we doing that?”
The Ludlow case
In spring 2012, NU’s Title IX Coordinator Joan Slavin sent former Weinberg dean Sarah Mangelsdorf the results of her investigation on philosophy Prof. Peter Ludlow.
“Ludlow repeatedly refused to answer whether he has had any sexual, dating, or romantic relationships with Northwestern undergraduate or graduate students,” Slavin wrote. “I am concerned that Ludlow may have a pattern of using his position as a faculty member to engage in sexual or romantic relationships with young female students.”
In the investigation, Slavin substantiated many of the claims made by a Medill senior who said Ludlow sexually assaulted her after a February 2012 art show the two attended together in downtown Chicago.
Through his lawyer, Ludlow has denied the student’s claims and sued NU for defamation. The suit was later dismissed.
More than 19 months after Slavin’s investigation, Ludlow alluded to a job change on Facebook by linking to a post on a philosophy blog that announced he would move to Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey. According to the blog, he was hired as director of Rutgers’ Center for Cognitive Science, where he had been a visiting professor in fall 2012.
The move seemed certain. The blog’s writer, University of Chicago Prof. Brian Leiter, told The Daily in February 2014 he had learned the information from both Rutgers and Ludlow.
Slavin had asked the student to keep confidential the limited findings she had shared with her from her investigation on Ludlow. NU’s investigation didn’t become public knowledge until February 2014 when, frustrated with the University’s handling of her reported sexual assault, the student filed a Title IX lawsuit against the school.
What had been hidden in personnel files and confidential emails could now be easily accessed online.
The day after news broke of Ludlow’s alleged sexual misconduct, Rutgers balked. At the time, spokesman Greg Trevor told The Daily that Rutgers was not aware of the allegations in the lawsuit and would not confirm the school had offered Ludlow a position or that he had accepted.
In July 2014, Rutgers announced Ludlow would not join its faculty and pushed blame toward Ludlow for not being forthcoming with details of alleged misconduct at NU.
“When Rutgers learned of allegations against Professor Ludlow at Northwestern, the university requested relevant information from Professor Ludlow and his attorney,” the spokesman wrote in a statement. “This information was not provided. As a result, Professor Ludlow will not be coming to Rutgers University.”
Ludlow’s attorney Kristin Case said the requested information could not be provided because of confidentiality issues. NU declined to comment, citing pending litigation.

Mobilizing under the campus group Women Organizing Against Harassment, Rutgers students protested Ludlow’s candidacy and petitioned their university to vet candidates for sexual misconduct. The university’s near hiring of Ludlow left some students feeling shaken, said Maci Nordone, a member of WOAH.
“We still don’t really know how to prevent something like this from happening in the future,” said Nordone, a Rutgers sophomore. “What if this didn’t come up in the news? Then he could be here right now.”
Worried about Ludlow’s plans to move to Rutgers, a group of about 20 concerned NU professors wrote a petition in February 2014 to the Board of Trustees asking them to make sure “professors who have been determined (by campus or legal processes) to have committed sexual harassment, violence, or abuse shall not be ‘passed on’ to other Universities.”
With the hiring process centered on a candidate’s academic record, experts say it’s easy for disciplinary infractions to go unnoticed. Rutgers was unaware of the allegations against Ludlow just as NU was unaware of Knowles’ misconduct at Ohio State.
“Might we be vulnerable to hiring someone who committed academic fraud? Plagiarism? It could be anything — I have no idea,” University President Morton Schapiro told The Daily in March. “It’s a fair question.”

http://www.thepostathens.com/article/2017/02/sexual-harassment-escobedo-benoit,"
                                                            Ohio University Executive Vice President and Provost Pam Benoit is recommending the university place ""serious sanctions"" on an English professor whom six female students accused of sexual harassment.
In a letter to interim President David Descutner on Thursday, Benoit wrote that Andrew Escobedo's misconduct was ""egregious"" and could merit loss of tenure and dismissal.

                                

                                An investigation by the Office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance found on Dec. 15 that Escobedo sexually harassed four female students. The office found insufficient evidence that the misconduct occurred for two other complaints.
The incidents of sexual harassment occurred as early as 2003, according to a memo from the Office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance. Escobedo was accused of touching multiple female students sexually and kissing one without consent after buying those students drinks at bars. The students told Title IX investigators that they were afraid denying his advances would affect their grades or reputation.
The office found Escobedo’s actions constituted three types of sexual misconduct: sexual harassment by quid pro quo, sexual harassment by hostile environment and non-consensual sexual contact.
The Office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance bases its findings on a “preponderance of evidence standard,” which means the office believes the misconduct more likely than not occurred. That is a lesser standard than the one used in criminal court where a defendant must be proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
Some faculty recommended Escobedo undergo an ethics investigation, an option Benoit disagreed with in her letter. Ethics violations can result in a reprimand, censure, temporary reassignment of duties or a fine. Benoit believes Escobedo’s actions were severe enough that the university should consider “a full range of sanctions,” including dismissal.
“I find that Dr. Escobedo’s conduct violates the most basic relationship between faculty and student and erodes the foundation of trust upon which the academy depends,” Benoit wrote in the letter to Descutner.

                                

                                                                                                    After Descutner makes his decision, the OU Board of Trustees will vote on the final disciplinary sanctions against Escobedo.
Escobedo is a tenure-track professor who began working for the university in 1998 and makes $87,149 a year. He is on paid administrative leave and not permitted on campus until the disciplinary process ends.

                                Andrew Escobedo, an Ohio University English professor whom the university initiated dismissal proceedings against earlier this year, is no longer with the university.Escobedo’s resignation went into effect on Nov. 1. Through a university Title IX investigation, the university found through a preponderance of evidence standard that, more likely than not, Escobedo had sexually touched two graduate students without their consent multiple times during an end-of-semester party in 2015. The university’s Office for Equity and Civil Rights Compliance investigation (which completed late last year) also found that Escobedo, through a preponderance-of-evidence standard, had sexually harassed those two women, along with sexually harassing two other students in similar incidents in 2003 and 2005.Escobedo had been on paid administrative leave from the university since March 2016, when the university began that investigation. He earned his roughly $86,000 a year base salary until Oct. 31, even though he wasn’t working, an OU spokesperson previously confirmed.Escobedo announced his resignation in late August, just two weeks before he was scheduled to appear at a hearing before senior members of OU Faculty Senate to argue why he should not be fired. That committee then would have provided a recommendation to the Board of Trustees on whether should be terminated for sexual misconduct. OU found two complaints against Escobedo to be unsubstantiated in the ECRC investigation, pending the university receiving any further evidence. Since he’s not facing any criminal charges to date, Escobedo leaving prior to being fired for his alleged sexual misconduct could mean he feels this gives him a better chance of finding a job at another university. In a statement sent to The NEWS after announcing his resignation, Escobedo maintained his innocence.“... the findings of the University Equity and Civil Rights Compliance office were fundamentally flawed, and (a) professor’s reputation and livelihood should not be ruined because of misrepresentations and mean-spirited accusations based on rumor and gossip,” Escobedo wrote via email. “Ohio University’s administration made it clear to me and my lawyers that they planned to fire me no matter what the faculty hearing determined. Thus, I believe that my resignation is in the best interest of my family and my finances at this time, and that continuing to fight what appears to be a foregone conclusion is not.” OU President Duane Nellis released a statement at the time of Escobedo’s announced resignation reaffirming the university’s “commitment to protect the safety and well-being” of students, faculty, and staff.“Brave women and other people in our community stepped forward to bring intolerable behavior to light,” Nellis said. “The healing process I envision is not one that will dim this light but rather intensify our efforts to ensure our community is a safe place to learn and work.”Escobedo and the university, as well as the former chair of the English Department (who is also the chair of Faculty Senate), are currently named in a civil-rights lawsuit filed by the two graduate students mentioned above, alleging Escobedo sexually touched them without their consent, and that the university had been “deliberately indifferent” to past signs of his sexual misconduct. Back-and-forth filings in that case, including motions to dismiss the lawsuit by the university and Escobedo (Escobedo and the university are being represented by separate legal counsel), have occurred in recent months. Both Escobedo and the defendants have requested a jury trial, but a date has not yet been set.In June, The NEWS asked Benjamin Bates, outgoing chair of OU Faculty Senate’s promotion and tenure committee, about the de-tenuring process the university used for Escobedo. He noted that it seems rare for the university to get as far in the process as it did on this occasion; the last time OU dismissed a tenured professor, to his knowledge, was in the 1990s.

                                                            An Ohio University professor of journalism was found on Friday to have sexually harassed a graduate student.
Through an Office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance investigation, Yusuf Kalyango, director of the Institute for International Journalism, was found responsible for sexual harassment by quid pro quo and sexual harassment by hostile work environment toward a graduate student last year. 

                                

                                The Post does not name people who report sexual harassment or assault unless they give permission. The student who reported harassment declined to comment at this time. Kalyango was not available for an interview before press time.
The ECRC findings are based on a preponderance of evidence standard, meaning the office found that Kalyango more likely than not sexually harassed the student. That standard is lower than the standard of criminal proceedings, which require a defendant to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The student had been hired as a staff member in spring 2017 for two upcoming programs run by Kalyango when Kalyango offered the student an opportunity to travel abroad with him. The student had been hired to work during a summer program and a fall program, and the trip abroad directly followed the summer program. 
Just two days before Kalyango and the student were scheduled to depart, Kalyango told her they would have to share a hotel room because only one was available. The student rejected that as inappropriate and Kalyango tried to convince her otherwise, according to the report. Kalyango ended up staying in another city.
An ECRC investigator found that there was no “reasonable, non-sexual rationale” for the two to share a hotel room.
“The only reasonable objective perspective is that a full professor requested that a graduate student enrolled in his own institution place herself at considerable risk for inappropriate, sexual advances by (him) thousands of miles from home and in a country with which (he) is familiar and comfortable but where (she) would be nearly completely dependent upon (him),” wrote investigator G. Antonio Anaya.

                                

                                                                                                    Kalyango had reportedly emailed and texted the student after-hours frequently throughout spring and would compliment her clothing and physique. Kalyango asked the student for a photo of her to show his son, invited her out for meals and coffee numerous times and shared personal details about his previous marriage, according to the report. 
After the student rejected Kalyango’s invitation to stay in the same hotel room, he began to treat her differently, according to the report. 
In July, Kalyango sent the student an email accusing her of falsifying evaluations for the summer program in order to make herself look better and him worse and entering incomplete and inaccurate data. The student resigned from her position in the fall program Kalyango directed. 
The ECRC report has been submitted to Kalyango’s department chair and the Scripps College of Communication Dean Scott Titsworth for possible disciplinary action, according to the report. Students enrolled in Kalyango’s classes have been notified that he will not be teaching those courses, E.W. Scripps School of Journalism Director Robert Stewart said.

							Ohio University Professor Asks For Dismissal Of Lawsuit

							ATHENS (WOUB) — An Ohio University professor is asking to be dismissed from a lawsuit in which he is accused of sexually harassing a graduate student who worked with him.
Yusuf Kalyango, Jr.
Dr. Yusuf Kalyango filed a motion April 12 with the U.S. District Court Southern District of Ohio Eastern Division, claiming none of the woman’s claims in the lawsuit have merit.
Tess Herman filed a lawsuit against both Kalyango and Ohio University, alleging Kalyango sexually harassed her and caused harm to her educational experience and the job under which she was supervised by Kalyango.
After a year-long university investigation into Herman’s claims of sexual harassment and hostile work environment, an investigator substantiated her claims, leading to discussion of discipline for Kalyango. The university is still in the process of conducting detenuring proceedings against Kalyango, which will be considered by a faculty committee. This committee plans to meet after they receive information on two other investigations of Dr. Kalyango, one of which remains open.
Attorney Gregory Beck argues that Herman voluntarily resigned from her employment in the Young African Leaders Initiative, not fired by Kalyango, and that she “fails to set forth facts that rise to the level of sexual harassment or retaliation.”
Beck particularly mentions a hotel in Rwanda, where Kalyango claimed there was only one room available, offering to share the room, according to Herman’s lawsuit. Beck said Kalyango said he would “stay out of (plaintiff’s) way,” and he did not end up staying in the room.
In response to claims that Kalyango acted retaliatory because Herman did not want to sit next to him on the plane home from the trip to Africa, he said Herman “rebuffed the typical and expected work-related behavior for the lengthy travel home with the YALI program, which was used to inventory and reconcile expense documents…”
“The plaintiff asked Dr. Kalyango to change her seat assignment for the return flight from South Africa so that she was not seated near Dr. Kalyango or in a position to go over the expense reports during the course of the return flight,” court documents stated. “Dr. Kalyango obliged and changed her seat upon request.”
After the financial report was submitted, Kalyango “found it to be grossly inadequate and rife with errors,” requiring him to spend “over forty hours reviewing and correcting the financial expense report.”
The court documents say Kalyango sent an email advising Herman of her mistakes in the report, but the email was constructive criticism that would have been given to any other employee.
“In this case, irrespective of the alleged sexual harassment, the plaintiff has failed to sufficiently allege that any other student who did not adequately perform her task would not also have been emailed a reprimand,” Beck wrote.
The attorney also asks that the sexual harassment claims be dismissed because her lawsuit “does not reveal that she was subjected to unwelcomed sexual harassment, that such harassment was based on sex, that she submitted to any unwelcomed advances on condition of receiving any benefits, or that a tangible job or education detriment occurred as a result of her refusal to submit to any sexual demands.”
“While some of the conduct asserted by (Herman) may appear on its face to be mildly inappropriate for a student/professor or employee/supervisor relationship, none of it constituted requests for sexual favors,” the motion states.
Ohio University has already asked to be dismissed from the lawsuit, claiming administration took the necessary steps to address the situation when they were notified of it.
Kalyango also filed a cross-claim to the Herman’s lawsuit in which he denies the claims, accuses the university of discriminating against him, and the university investigator of conducting a flawed investigation.

                                                            Correction appended.
An Ohio University journalism professor was found in violation of OU policies that include sexual harassment by hostile environment on Thursday. 

                                

                                The professor, Yusuf Kalyango, was already found responsible for sexually harassing a graduate student in September, according to a previous Post report. That was through an investigation conducted by Ohio University’s Office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance, or ECRC. The investigation found that Kalyango was responsible for sexual harassment by quid pro quo and sexual harassment by hostile work environment.
The ECRC findings are based on a preponderance of evidence standard, meaning the office found that Kalyango was more likely to have sexually harassed the student than to have not. That standard is lower than the standard of criminal proceedings, which require a defendant to be found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
ECRC Civil Rights Investigator G. Antonio Anaya initiated the most recent investigation into Kalyango. The investigation looked into allegations of sexual misconduct that took place on or around March 1, 2011. During that time, an OU student was in Zambia for a course that Kalyango taught in conjunction with a senior lecturer from the University of Zambia, according to the investigation memorandum. 
The Post does not name people who report sexual harassment or assault unless they give permission.
During that time, the student alleged that Kalyango did multiple actions without her consent. She alleges that Kalyango put her in a position where she was up against a wall and tried to kiss and make out with her.
The memorandum also states that Kalyango tried to get the student to share a hotel with him in Chile and booked a suite for the two of them in Washington, D.C. The student was not aware that the two would be sharing a suite in Washington.

                                

                                                                                                    During that time in Washington, Kalyango “sat on her bed, and placed his arm across (her) body and leaned into her, making her uncomfortable,” according to the memorandum.
During the investigation, Kalyango said that the student tried to “frame” him by using a similar storyline to Kalyango’s past incident involving sexual harassment. However, in the investigation, the student had screenshots, tweets and witnesses to support her claims.
Kalyango claimed that financial records from OU show that he traveled alone but never produced such records, according to the memorandum.
The student was earlier contacted by both Institutional Equity and the Center for International Studies, according to the memorandum, about reports of inappropriate behavior by a witness. The student denied the claims to both parties, but when asked by Anaya, she said that the claims were true. At that time, the student also spoke about the allegations in Chile and Washington.

                                                            Correction appended.
A journalism faculty member has started the process for losing his tenure after he was investigated within the university and then sued for sexually harassing a student on a university trip.

                                

                                Yusuf Kalyango, who joined the journalism faculty in 2008, has his teaching and advising duties suspended, but Carly Leatherwood, a university spokesperson, said he is now working on research.
Kalyango’s salary was over $106,000 and will remain the same, Leatherwood said.
Ohio University President Duane Nellis started the loss of tenure proceedings in January 2019 after reviewing Kalyango’s appeal and the University Professional Ethics Committee report, according to a previous Post report.
Kalyango was barred from being on campus and his research was done off-campus.
Kalyagno was found responsible for harassment by quid pro quo and sexual harassment by a hostile work environment toward a graduate student, according to a previous Post report.
Kalyango was sued by the student in January 2019.

                                

                                                                                                    Kalyango, who formerly directed the Institute for International Journalism, allegedly invited the student out to movies and various restaurants, as she was interested in international employment opportunities. Kalyango denied that he invited the student to the movies, shopping or dinner, according to Kalyango’s defense.
Kalyango, who has two sons, allegedly would text the student late at night, asking her to go out and telling her she was beautiful. The student told Kalyango those messages were inappropriate.
Kalyango denied this in his defense. He admitted to texting the student but denied calling her beautiful.
During a trip to Africa, Kalyango told the student that the resort only had one room and that they would have to stay in the room together, according to the lawsuit. Kalyango denied this in his response to the lawsuit.
                                                                    
                                One night, Kalyango allegedly bought multiple drinks for the student and “relentlessly urged (the student) to become intoxicated,” according to the lawsuit.
The student approached Judy Millesen, the supervisor of the Africa trip and an OU professor who was a mandatory sexual harassment reporter. Millesen allegedly told the student that Kalyango’s misconduct “was an unfortunate part of the job,” according to the lawsuit.
Millesen, who did not report the harassment, allegedly told the student that if she wanted to stay on the job, she should do whatever Kalyango wanted. Kalyango denied this in his response.
After returning from the trip, the student lost her bag, and Kalyango “aggressively yelled” at the student that it was their fault, and airport employees had to defend the student to attempt to calm Kalyango, according to the lawsuit.
The student stepped down from her position. Mary Rogus, a journalism professor and “close friend” of Kalyango, allegedly tried to persuade the student not to report Kalyango to the Equity and Civil Rights Compliance Office, according to the lawsuit.
Kalyango denied this happening in his response to the lawsuit.
The student also sued OU, claiming the university enabled the type of sexual harassment and misconduct that Kalyango engaged in by failing to implement policies to prevent professors from using their authority to seek sexual and romantic relationships with students.
The most recent update of the lawsuit was a motion to vacate on March 24 because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
                                At one point before the trip, the student told Kalyango that they would be flying home for a few days. Kalyango allegedly said, “Driving ten hours at night can be fun” and “I know a driver … for real … one who doesn’t mind driving ten hours back and forth … seriously,” according to OU findings from 2018.
Kalyagno denied that these messages were sent in his response to the lawsuit.
A recommendation that was made by faculty of the journalism school has been given to the Dean of the College of Communication Scott Titsworth.
The ECRC recommended that if Kalyango stayed in his position, he would need to receive training to OU policies including sexual misconduct, relationship violence and stalking.
Tenure is awarded to people who are likely to significantly contribute to academics at OU.
When a faculty member’s tenure is questioned, the member has a meeting with the department chair about the matter, according to the university handbook. If it is not settled between the person and the chair, then the chair will consult with members of their department.
Then, with the advice of the promotion and tenure committee, a recommendation is forwarded in writing to the dean of the college.
A hearing to determine if the individual should be removed from their position is then conducted by a faculty committee. The faculty member has 60 days to prepare their defense.
Suspension of the faculty member is justified only if immediate harm to themselves or others are threatened by them still working.
If the faculty member’s tenure is terminated, they will receive their salary for at least one year, according to the faculty handbook.

                                Ohio University settled a federal sexual harassment lawsuit in May, awarding $90,000 to a graduate student who alleged that the institution infringed on her civil rights by empowering faculty to abuse their authority.The payment will be awarded to Tess Herman for the “alleged physical and related emotional injuries” she endured at the hands of the institution and OU journalism professor Yusuf Kalyango, according to the settlement agreement.Herman and her lawyer, Michael Fradin, filed the suit in January of 2019 against both the university and Kalyango.“Tess has demonstrated amazing strength, courage, persistence and patience throughout years of legal proceedings with OU.Her efforts will help pave the path toward truly equal access in higher education,” Fradin told The Athens NEWS.The lawsuit alleged that Kalyango unsuccessfully attempted to coerce Herman, his student, into sharing a hotel room with him on a university-sponsored trip to Africa, among many other instances of unwanted romantic advances toward her.The professor allegedly retaliated against Herman after she declined to spend the night in the room with him by falsifying her job performance evaluations to make her seem less competent in the workplace, resulting in a violation of Herman’s rights under federal Title IX law, according to the lawsuit.Herman notified two university employees who were mandatory reporters about the unwanted advances Kalyango made on her, and both failed to report Herman’s complaints to the OU Office of University Equity and Civil Rights Compliance (ECRC) because they were reportedly not trained to do so, the lawsuit said.The OU ECRC previously conducted an investigation into Kalyango’s conduct and found through a preponderance of evidence that he sexually harassed another student who he supervised during the 2011-2012 academic year, according to a previous report in The Athens NEWS.Kalyango is still employed by the university to conduct research, but he no longer has contact with students in that role, OU Spokesperson Carly Leatherwood said in an email.Leatherwood, however, declined to comment on the nature of Kalyango’s research or where specifically he is conducting it. The professor is currently undergoing a formal process in accordance with the OU faculty handbook that will revoke his tenure, Leatherwood said.The university previously filed a motion to dismiss the civil lawsuit, The Athens NEWS reported in March of 2019.The university said at that time in a response to the lawsuit that it doesn’t deny the results of its Title IX investigation – finding that Kalyango sexually harassed Herman, who worked in programs led by Kalyango in 2017, and created a hostile work environment for that student, through a “preponderance of evidence” standard.However, the university in its response denied that it was liable for any alleged misconduct by Kalyango, and argued that it did not have “actual knowledge” of the alleged harassment Herman was receiving up until Herman approached OU’s Title IX office.Herman agreed to be available, participate and testify in the tenure removal process, according to the settlement.

                                An Ohio University Faculty Senate committee recommended in December that journalism professor Yusuf Kalyango shouldn’t lose tenure and immediately be reinstated as a full professor after not being ensured adequate due process by the E.W. Scripps School of Journalism and the Scripps College of Communication.Kalyango has been at the center of several university investigations and lawsuits in recent years related to allegations of sexual misconduct from at least two women, resulting in official university channels, including ethics committees and former Provost and Executive Vice President Chaden Djalali, recommending that he lose tenure and be fired.He was suspended in 2018 by the university in consultation with the Scripps college after an investigation by the OU Office for Equity and Civil Rights Compliance, or the Title IX office, found that he sexually harassed a graduate student. Kalyango is still employed by the university to conduct research, but doesn’t have contact with students in the role.The Faculty Senate committee was charged in December with reviewing Kalyango’s appealing of tenure revocation through evidence and testimonies from women who alleged Kalyango mistreated them and from faculty members, according to the hearing committee report obtained by The Athens NEWS.The committee’s members, Dr. Robin Muhammad — Faculty Senate chair — and Drs. Mark Franz, Sheryl House, Charles Lowery, Lauren McMills, Vladimir Marchenkov and Yehong Shao-Lucas, voted 5-1 in favor of Kalyango’s appeal.“My only brief comment is to thank the Faculty Senate for affording me the opportunity to finally be heard, and for exonerating me. I have learned a lot from this unfair devastating experience and I promise to use this traumatic experience to better myself and those around me,” Kalyango, A Black man who sued OU in recent months alleging discrimination, said in an email.“Despite the devastating setback based on malicious allegations that were aimed at destroying my hard-earned academic career, I have no hard feelings and no animosity toward anybody. Hence, I am eager to continue advancing the mission and vision of OU and our students with grace, humility, understanding, and awareness.”The OU Board of Trustees will render the final ruling on whether Kalyango gets to keep his tenure based on a presentation of the case that Muhammad is expected to give. It’s not clear when the board’s decision will be made. Muhammad declined to comment on the committee’s recommendation.“{span}Throughout this entire process, we have demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate our commitment to protect the safety and wellbeing of our students, faculty, and staff; to provide a learning and working environment that is free from sexual misconduct; and to hold all members of our community accountable to these values,” the university said in a statement.{/span}Former OU graduate student Tess Herman, who provided testimony before the committee, brought her case in 2017 to OU’s Title IX office, which found that she was harassed by Kalyango.She went on in 2019 to file a lawsuit against OU in federal court, alleging it violated her civil rights by empowering Kalyango and other faculty members to abuse their power after she was harassed on a school trip to Africa and retaliated against. The case resulted in a $90,000 settlement last year and Kalyango firmly denied wrongdoing throughout.The committee neither heard nor read “clear and convincing evidence” in Herman’s case, saying her role in the investigation “crossed the line between what is appropriate and professional and can damage the integrity” of a university investigation, according to the document.Several other testimonies, according to the report, “directly contradicted” or poked holes in the Title IX office’s findings that Kalyango sexually harassed Herman.“Tess is saddened by the news. She did absolutely everything right every step of the way including providing truthful testimony in the tenure revocation proceeding after her civil rights lawsuit had been resolved,” Herman’s attorney Michael Fradin said in a statement. “It is troubling that a University that took almost 4 years to hold a hearing would criticize the victim for being too proactive. I fear that it reflects a deeper institutional lack of respect for its victims.”Another woman who testified, Lindsay Boyle, filed her case in 2018 in relation to events that allegedly transpired in 2011 and 2012 on school-sponsored trips abroad when she was a student.Boyle, who admitted to lying in 2012 about the validity of sexual misconduct allegations against Kalyango because she had several important career opportunities that wouldn’t have happened without her work under programs directed by the professor, came forward after being contacted by a journalism faculty member, according to the report. The Title IX office ultimately substantiated her allegations against Kalyango.But the committee didn’t find her testimony convincing, saying: “it appears that (Boyle’s) testimony was sought to build a case against Dr. Kalyango outside the normal procedures” of a Title IX investigation, according to the document.“While I’m disappointed by this recommendation — and by the characterization of my case specifically — I can’t say I’m surprised,” Boyle said in an email. “Society for decades has gone to extreme lengths to protect perpetrators of sexual assault and harassment. That said, it’s concerning that this committee turned a blind eye to several blatant lies put forth by a professor of journalism and focused instead on the why behind my coming forward ...”“... As I’ve said from the beginning, my only motivation was to set the record straight — to correct the lie I told as a young, financially insecure woman concerned about what would happen if I told the truth. The worst part is knowing it may all have been for naught.”Testimonies from witnesses on either side of the conflict revealed that both the Scripps college and the journalism school were deeply divided on the handling of Kalyango’s case, resulting in the graduate admissions committee becoming drawn into interpersonal conflicts among faculty, the report said. The committee was “gravely concerned” that faculty members were using students and alumni to pursue a case against Kalyango in the name of protecting others.Because the university investigations that led to recommendations of revoking Kalyango’s tenure — the most severe punishment in academia — hinged on the initial findings of the Scripps college and journalism school, the committee determined that it couldn’t find evidence that either entity ensured due process for Kalyango.“We have concluded that the efforts to find evidence on both sides of the case were not thorough, consistent, nor equitable,” the document said. “Additionally, we do not see clear and convincing evidence that the faculty member was provided sufficient opportunity to be heard in a hearing by his superiors or peers at the department or college level. Therefore, this brings due process into question.”Dean Scott Titsworth of the Scripps college and the recently retired director of the journalism school, Robert Stewart, remain under investigation by the university’s Title IX office after Kalyango filed a complaint last year, a university spokesperson confirmed, though the specifics of Kalyango’s complaint against both men aren’t clear.The committee sought but was unable to find evidence or hear testimony that suggested Kalyango was ever given an opportunity by either the journalism school or the Scripps college to respond to allegations of misconduct, according to the hearing report. It also couldn’t find whether other disciplinary actions were taken prior to detenuring and whether there was evidence of arbitration.The Survivor Advocacy Outreach Program can be reached at 740-591-4266.

ATHENS, Ohio — An Ohio University professor has been fired for alleged sexual misconduct.                    
                    
The Post, the Ohio University student newspaper, reported Yusuf Kalyango, Jr. sexually harassed two students.                    
                    
In a statement, the university said that Kalyango ""violated university policy prohibiting sexual misconduct"", according to two investigations in 2018 and 2019 by its office of Equity and Civil Rights Compliance.                    
                        
                    
The Board of Trustees voted Friday to revoke Kalyango's tenure and then he was terminated.                    
                    
According to his biography on the university website, Kalyango joined the faculty at the Scripps College of Communication in 2008.                    
                    
The university ended its statement with the following:                    
                    
""The University reaffirms its commitment to providing a learning environment where students can decide the ways that work for them to report these incidents for investigation to the University; and for individual, confidential care. As the University moves forward, we will continue to challenge our campus community to help us strengthen our commitment to a sexual violence and harassment free campus.To the survivors in these stories: Ohio University recognizes your courage and the bravery you demonstrated in sharing your experience with sexual misconduct on our campus. We believe you.""

A settlement agreement has been reached in a sexual harassment
lawsuit filed by two students against a former Oregon State
University professor.
In the lawsuit, filed in October 2005, two OSU students accused
former professor Ron Leavitt of sexual harassment. The students,
Christi Sherman and S. Chantell Carpenter, were teaching assistants
for Leavitt, who was a professor in the communi
cations department. Each of them also worked for Leavitt at his
business, Corvallis Hearing and Speech Center.
The lawsuit also named the former dean of OSU's College of
Liberal Arts, the University and the Corvallis Hearing and Speech
Center as defendants
. Kay Schaffer, the former dean of the liberal arts college, was
dropped from the lawsuit in September 2007.
The Benton County Circuit Court received notification of the
settlement on May 1, which canceled the jury trial that had been
scheduled to begin Mo

            nday. The details of the settlement have not been disclosed.
In a letter to the Benton County Circuit Court, the plaintiff's
Portland attorney, Charese Rohny, told the court that a settlement
had been reached with all defendants. Rohny wrote that the
court
should expect the formal agreement to be submitted by Thursday,
June 5. However, the agreement had not been filed in court records
by close of business on Tuesday.
Involved plaintiffs, defendants and attorneys did not return
calls Tuesday for comments.

Two say university failed to take action on sexual
harassment complaint
An August trial date for a lawsuit filed by two former Oregon
State University students has been postponed.
Christi Sherman and S. Chantell Carpenter accused former OSU
professor Ron Leavitt of sexual harassment in a lawsuit filed
October 2005. According to the complaint, Sherman and Carpenter
were teaching assistants for Leavitt, who was a professor in the
Speech Communication Department at OSU. Each of them also worked
for Leavitt at his business, the Corvallis Hearing and Speech
Center.
Oregon State University and the former dean of OSU's College of
Liberal Arts, Kay Schaffer, are also named in the lawsuit. Sherman
and Carpenter allege Leavitt harassed other teaching assistants
before them and OSU knew about it and should have taken action to
stop him.

            Leavitt and OSU have filed separate responses to the complaint.
Leavitt denies any inappropriate actions. OSU says once university
officials learned of Leavitt's behavior, they did respond
appropriately.
Leavitt resigned his position as a professor at OSU in December
2004, shortly after Sherman and Carpenter complained about him to
university officials.
According to the complaint, Leavitt made sexually harassing
comments to Sherman four or five times a day in 2004, when she was
his student and teaching assistant. Leavitt said things such as
""that he wished she (Sherman) had not worn underwear when (she)
wore skirts,"" the complaint says. Some of his other alleged
comments are more sexually explicit. Sherman also accused Leavitt
of touching her inappropriately, sometimes in front of other
people.
Sherman often objected to Leavitt about his behavior, according
to the complaint.
""Sherman told Leavitt she was greatly offended by him slapping
her buttocks, and she demanded he keep his hands off her and stop
his sexually offensive comments,"" the complaint says. ""After that
conversation, Leavitt was visibly mad and retaliated by taking away
responsibilities for editing his book.""
In the complaint, Carpenter says Leavitt made sexual advances to
her and used the promise of future employment to manipulate her
into taking business trips with him. He would then book only one
hotel room, with one bed, for both of them. He also made many
explicit sexual comments to her and suggested he would leave his
marriage for her, according to the complaint.
Leavitt admits employing Sherman and Carpenter and admits making
business trips with them. But he denies the rest of their
allegations.
""The plaintiffs Sherman and Carpenter 'became friends' during
the course of their employment"" at Leavitt's business, his response
reads, ""and mutually decided, and did together, make a self-serving
and misleading report to an administrative official at Oregon State
University on October 20, 2004.""
Although Carpenter says she received academic credit for her
work at Leavitt's business, OSU's position as detailed in its
response to the complaint is that no outside work for Leavitt was a
requirement for graduation. An OSU attorney has filed a motion with
the court requesting a summary judgment on Schaffer's part of the
lawsuit, saying neither Sherman nor Carpenter ever discussed their
complaints against Leavitt with her.
OSU does not deny Leavitt's behavior toward the two women. In
their responses, OSU and Schaffer admit Leavitt made sexually
explicit remarks and advances to the two women and touched
them.
But OSU and Schaffer ""deny that more than a few of these acts
occurred on the OSU campus or at any OSU activity,"" their response
reads.
They also deny any responsibility for Leavitt's behavior toward
Sherman and Carpenter while they worked for him at his
business.
Sherman's attorney, Charese Rohny, said Tuesday that there had
been rumors of Leavitt's sexual harassment of students as an
ongoing pattern. She declined to discuss what witnesses she planned
to call to testify about this aspect of the case in the event of a
trial.
In the most recent developments, Rohny filed a motion to
reschedule the trial to accommodate Sherman's plans to begin
medical school in Virginia on a contract with the Air Force. She
can attend a trial but not on the August date previously set. The
motion was granted by Judge David Connell in a hearing Monday.
Rohny, who has represented both women until now, also said she
feels she has a conflict in continuing to represent both
plaintiffs. Carpenter is looking for a new attorney to represent
her.
A motion filed by Leavitt's attorney to sever the two cases was
denied Monday by Connell. A hearing was scheduled for Oct. 8 to set
a new trial date.

http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2017/12/osu_professor_fired_for_sexual_harassment_bullying_makes_rare_appeal_to_trustees.html,"A. Morrie CraigA veteran Oregon State University professor fired over allegations of sexual harassment and bullying has appealed his dismissal to the school's board of trustees, according to board documents.Oregon State trustees on Dec. 11 will determine the fate of A. Morrie Craig, a toxicology professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine. He was first hired by the university in 1976.Craig's attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday.The appeal is a rare example of a faculty member fighting for his or her employment by seeking intervention from a school's independent governing board. The university board formed in 2014 following the dissolution of the State Board of Higher Education.""Usually, matters such as these are settled by a university and the faculty member,"" said Steve Clark, a university spokesman. He said he was not aware of any appeal made to the now-defunct higher education board.Clark declined to provide any specifics surrounding the alleged harassment that led to Craig's termination. ""The university does take complaints of bullying and sexual harassment very seriously,"" he said. Craig is still working at the Corvallis campus pending the outcome of Monday's board meeting.According to university documents shared with the board of trustees, Craig on May 16 was accused of ""engaging in bullying and sexual harassment,"" a violation of school policies punishable by dismissal. Oregon State defines bullying as ""conduct of any sort directed at another that is severe, pervasive, or persistent."" The behavior must be something that would cause someone in the victim's shoes ""substantial emotional distress and undermine his or her ability to work, study or participate in his or her regular life activities.""A special committee of the school's Faculty Senate held a two-day hearing and heard testimony from 18 witnesses. Craig also testified on his own behalf at the hearing, according to the documents. The faculty committee recommended firing Craig on Oct. 23, and Ray sent the letter a week later.University President Ed Ray sent Craig a letter terminating his employment on Oct. 30.Craig petitioned the Benton County Circuit Court on Nov. 6 to review the decision. But Judge Matthew Donohue wrote back the same day to say the court had no jurisdiction.The court documents, which included emails sent by concerned faculty and students, shed some light on the case. One veterinary student wrote to veterinary school dean Dr. Susan Tornquist in May to say she was ""sickened"" by his instruction and demeanor in the classroom. Denise Apperson, the student, listed her concerns: ""The outright falsehoods, the misinterpretation of fundamental science, the misstatements of fact, the manufactured dramatics, all overlain with an overt creepiness.""""I hope that you understand where my strong words are coming from. I hope that there is a resolution to this.""Apperson, in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, said she could not comment on the case.On Monday, the university's trustees will have a chance to review and discuss the case. The board's 13 members are a mix of prominent business leaders, alumni and educators who are appointed by the governor.Clark said the trustees could vote to: support the university's decision to fire Craig with cause; return the case to the school for additional testimony and review; create a committee of the trustees' board to investigate the issue; or opt for an independent hearings officer to determine Craig's fate. Clark said it's unclear who would make the next move, the Faculty Senate or the school administration, if the board sends the issue back to Oregon State.Monday's meeting is by teleconference, and the public won't be able to call in or stream the meeting online, Clark said. An in-person listening station is available in Room 208 of the Memorial Union.Dr. Linda Blythe, a retired Oregon State veterinary professor who worked closely with Craig for decades, said she did not witness him bully or sexually harass students or researchers.She described the allegations against him as a ""sad end"" to a research career that brought millions of dollars in grants and funding to Oregon State.""We have had a large number of graduate students come through that lab, and never one complaint in 40 years,"" Blythe said, referring to the decades prior to the university's investigation.Craig's ties to Oregon State are deep. He spent his entire career at the university after earning his doctorate there in 1970. He was granted tenure in 1982 and was recently paid $147,252, according to university records. His parents were also alumni, according to his mother's obituary.Craig founded a lab that tests for toxins in grass and other types of feed, Blythe said. The toxins pose a lethal threat to animals. Detecting them is crucial to farmers in Benton and Linn counties, the hub of Oregon's grass seed industry. The lab also tests for toxins in a variety of samples sent by veterinarians from all over the world, Blythe said.-- Andrew Theen and Molly YoungLynne Palombo of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report"

Ed Vaughan, a retired theater professor, was accused by a student of sexual imposition in May 2013. The case was not filed in Franklin County Municipal Court until August of the same year. Otterbein’s police department refused to release the incident report to Otterbein360.com.
Otterbein360.com requested and obtained the incident report from the Westerville City Prosecutor Michael Fultz. The report included a three-page OPD report and a two-page victim statement. 
The victim statement described the incident with Vaughan. The victim wrote that other students and professors were present when the incident occurred. 
                            Vaughan, now retired, pleaded no contest to charges of sexual imposition, unlawful restraint and disorderly conduct Nov. 12 in Franklin County Municipal Court. Vaughan is to be sentenced on Jan. 9, 2014 by Judge Scott D. VanDerKarr. Sexual imposition is a third-degree misdemeanor under Ohio law and carries a maximum jail term of 60 days and up to a $500 fine.
A no-contest plea means that Vaughan accepted the facts presented by the prosecutor but did not plead guilty. Vaughan was ordered to stay away from the incident location.

http://www.pcccourier.com/news/swil-2.html," The journalism professor recently reinstated as an instructor at the college after admitting to showing nude photos of himself to a student is being sued by the student for alleged sexual harassment and grade retaliation, court documents show. Courier staff member Raymond Bernal accused former Courier adviser Warren Swil of showing him naked photos of himself and unfairly lowering his grades after Bernal turned down his sexual advances last March. The administration immediately launched an investigation into the incident that concluded last month and recently announced Swil will be reinstated in the spring. Bernal filed a lawsuit against Swil on Monday. “The conduct of Defendant Swil as herein alleged was despicable and constituted oppression and malice, thus entitling [Bernal] to an award of punitive damages against Defendant Swil,” court documents obtained by the Courier state. At the beginning of the Spring 2013 semester, Bernal asked Swil about his winter vacation in the newsroom. Subsequently, Swil invited Bernal into his office and closed the door behind him, according to allegations made in the documents. Swil said that he had gone on a boating trip and printed a group of pictures to show Bernal that included a naked photo of him, according to the documents. “Swil pointed to the naked picture, smiled, and asked Mr. Bernal what he thought about the picture,” the civil complaint reads. When Bernal tried to change the subject after being shown another group of pictures, Swil seemed disappointed and said, “Let’s keep this between you and me” as Bernal left the office, Bernal alleges. Attorneys for Swil and Bernal did not return messages seeking comment on this story. Bernal did not immediately report the incident to the college because he was unsure of whether or not Swil had made a sexual advance or if he was just more comfortable sharing such photos of himself, the lawsuit states. However, Bernal, who said he had received good grades and praise from Swil prior to the incident, began receiving lower grades on his assignments and was subjected to harsh criticism in front of the class, according to the documents. “Swil taped a copy of the newspaper to the wall of the classroom and wrote his assessment of each story in red ink. Swil wrote ‘weak story’ next to Mr. Bernal’s story. Notably, Mr. Bernal was the only student that Swil subjected to public ridicule,” the documents state. On another occasion, Swil refused to publish a story written by Bernal even though the editor-in-chief of the Courier at the time thought it was good and wanted to publish it, Bernal alleges. According to the documents, other Courier staff members started to notice a decline in Bernal’s well being and he sought treatment for depression, anxiety, headaches and stress at the U.S.C. Medical Center. Bernal is suing for general and punitive damages as well as a $25,000 civil penalty and attorneys’ fees.  I'm currently the sports editor for the Courier.

Details about the complaint, filed Nov. 12, are sparse. According to the college's spokeswoman, Lucy Miller, the complaint alleges that law enforcement academy instructor Don Ruminer touched, gestured and made inappropriate comments toward another person. The college is not releasing the victim/complainant's name, citing federal law, but said the complainant was not a student.The complaint was filed with the college's president, Katherine Johnson. Within 15 minutes of receiving it, the administration launched an investigation, Miller said.The investigation found that James Nagy, a security consultant at the college, saw the sexual harassment happening but did nothing. When college officials questioned him, Miller wrote in an email, Nagy was uncooperative. At some point, the investigation found that subordinates told the director of the college's public service programs, Nancy Bunch, about the harassment, but Bunch ""failed to take action,"" Miller wrote.The college fired Nagy and Ruminer on Monday. Neither will be asked back, Miller said. Bunch was put on probation.Ruminer previously taught at Hillsborough Community College's criminal justice institute and at Withlacoochee Technical Institute in Citrus County until his contract was not renewed in 2009. He came to PHCC in 2010.Nagy was hired as an adjunct instructor at PHCC in 1991 while he was working as a patrol deputy with the Pasco County Sheriff's Office. In his 23 years on the force, he had been the subject of 15 internal affairs investigations.In 2011, he was hired by the Tarpon Springs Police Department, and less than a year into his tenure he was accused of taking video of a 14-year-old girl's rear end while working security at a skating rink.Nagy was fired by Tarpon Springs the day the investigation began but kept working at the college. He was reassigned this year to work as a security consultant for the college and was not teaching cadets.Bunch directed the criminal justice institute at Florida Keys Community College from 1998 until 2009 when her contract was not renewed.""The College acted promptly, efficiently and appropriately in following through on a written complaint,"" Miller wrote. ""A thorough investigation was completed and appropriate decisions were made and carried out.""The complaint ""had nothing to do with the quality of instruction in the programs,"" she wrote. ""The College will continue to utilize a pool of highly qualified adjunct instructors, many of whom come from our local law enforcement agencies, to train students at the academy.""Times researcher Carolyn Edds contributed to this report.

COLUMBIA – A jury late Thursday found that a former Voorhees
College professor was sexually harassed by the college’s president
Lee E. Monroe and that Voorhees College “acted with malice or with
reckless indifference to the federally protected rights” of the
former professor.
Dr. Moreen B. Joseph brought the civil lawsuit against Monroe
and Voorhees College, alleging that Monroe sexually harassed her
and the college did nothing about it.
The jury awarded Joseph punitive damages of $400,000 and
compensatory damages of $100,000.
The trial before U.S. District Judge R. Bryan Harwell Monday at
the Matthews J. Perry Jr. Courthouse in Columbia and the jury came
back with the verdict last Thursday afternoon.
According to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court,
District of South Carolina, Orangeburg Division on July 13, 2004,
the Louthian Law Firm of Columbia, representing Joseph, alleged
that she was subjected to “lewd, gross and suggestive language of a
sexual nature and unwanted touching” by Monroe for a period of
several months in 2002 and 2003, creating a “hostile work
environment.”

            Monroe and Voorhees College, represented by Evans Taylor
Barnette of McCutchen Blanton Rhodes and Johnson, denied all of
Joseph’s allegations.
Joseph claimed that Monroe “repeatedly made unwelcome sexual
advances and implied that if she would agree to his sexual
advances, she would benefit personally and financially.”
The complaint went on to state that Monroe suggested to Joseph
that if she “received his sexual advances favorably, that she would
continue to prosper as an employee of the college and implied that
if she did not go along with his advances that she would regret
that decision.”
Joseph claimed that she “consistently and adamantly rejected …
Monroe’s advances and, as a result, she was retaliated against,
culminating in the loss of her position and more than $70,000 per
year in income.”
The complaint stated that Monroe and the college “discriminated
against and harassed (Joseph), retaliated against her and caused
her to suffer damages because of her sex (gender), all in violation
of Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, as amended.”
As a result of Monroe’s conduct, Joseph claimed that she
“suffered and continues to suffer severe emotional distress,
psychological injury, mental suffering and humiliation.”
The complaint also alleged that Monroe “unlawfully placed his
hands on the body of (Joseph) in a sexually suggestive and
offensive manner, thereby inflicting a battery upon her
person.”
However, the jury Thursday found that Joseph had not proven her
claim of battery.
Joseph also alleged that Monroe’s actions and conduct were
“pervasive and ongoing and known to the Board of Trustees and other
officials” at Voorhees College. The complaint stated that she
reported the sexual harassment and assault and battery to
appropriate officials at Voorhees including the Human Resources
Office and the Board of Trustees.
In answering the complaint, Monroe and Voorhees College denied
“each and every allegation” related to sexual harassment and
assault and battery.
The defendants, in their answer, acknowledged that Joseph
notified one or more college officials, including Monroe, of
“claimed sexual misconduct but failed to follow college policies
and procedures with regard to investigating said wrongful
conduct.”
The answer to the complaint also stated that Joseph was not
“terminated or constructively discharged by (Voorhees College).
Rather, (Joseph) voluntarily quit and terminated her employment
with Voorhees College,” and it called for the suit to be
dismissed.
In commenting on the jury’s decision, Don Fowler, Voorhees
College Board of Trustees member and spokesperson, said, “The
proceeding yesterday (Thursday) was disappointing but there are
additional steps before the final determination is made in respect
to this proceeding. We continue to have faith and confidence in Dr.
Monroe, and I will not have any other comment until the court has
concluded all of the steps in this process.”
Herbert W. Louthian, attorney for Joseph, said, “I feel that the
jury was very conscientious in their approach to the case. They
were attentive, they were diligent, they did their duty and, in so
doing ,they have helped us protect the lives of women in the
workplace.”

https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/education/2018/06/28/knoxville-pellissippi-state-coordinator-accused-sexual-harrasment-tom-gaddis/735651002/,"At the end of a cooking class in the fall of 2013, Caitlin Knight and her classmates at Pellissippi State Community College milled about, sweeping the floor and cleaning dishes.Then, Knight says, the coordinator of the school’s Hospitality and Culinary Arts programs, Tom Gaddis, walked up behind her, reached his hand inside her chef’s pants, grabbed the top of her underwear and pulled up, giving her a wedgie in a classroom at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.“He laughed after it,” Knight, now 25, said in a recent interview. “It was just absolutely petrifying.""Knight said that wasn't the first time Gaddis harassed her, but, fearing retribution, she stayed silent for years. She finally spoke out in December 2017 and filed a complaint with Pellissippi, detailing several allegations against Gaddis, including the wedgie.More:Read Pellissippi's investigative report into Knight's allegationsKnight is not alone in accusing Gaddis of sexual harassment. Two other women — Anna White, also a former Pellissippi State student, and Holly Knowling, a current culinary professor — have told college officials that Gaddis harassed them on campus, too.Pellissippi administrators investigated and found Gaddis had sexually harassed Knight, but they didn't fire him. Instead, they issued him a written reprimand, telling him to complete sexual harassment training and keep his hands off students, documents show.Gaddis denies Knight's allegations and said he only accepted the reprimand to avoid legal expenses.Meanwhile, the University of Tennessee — where some of the culinary classes take place — has temporarily banned Gaddis from its campus as officials work ""to clarify a timeline of events and gather additional information,"" said UT spokeswoman Tyra Haag.But he remains on the job as long as no one else accuses him of sexual harassment.""This is why women don't tell,"" said Knowling, whose own sexual harassment complaint against Gaddis was resolved in 2015.‘This is some kind of manipulation’When Caitlin Knight enrolled in Pellissippi’s Culinary Arts program in the fall of 2012, she was depressed. She continued to grieve the death of her father as she coped with the pain of watching her older brother struggle with opiate addiction. Her love of cooking, she said, ""was probably the only thing I knew for sure at that time.""She talked to Gaddis about her father's death, and he told her he ""would really look out for me when I was in the program,"" Knight said.""At 19, I was like, 'Wow, the ego on this guy to protect this young student who needs his protection,'"" Knight said. ""You get that feeling like this is gross. This is more than someone being kind. This is some kind of manipulation going on.""Knight said Gaddis began to massage her shoulders, whisper in her ear and initiate hugs where he’d grab her by the waist, pull her close and hold her “for several minutes” as he spoke to her.When she didn’t tell him to stop, he began pulling her onto his lap “like Santa” when they would meet in his office at Pellissippi’s campus on Division Street, Knight said. It was not uncommon for him to pinch or pat her bottom afterwards, she said.“It’s just all very inappropriate. So that was just sprinkled in all the time, any time I saw him,” Knight said, adding that Gaddis’ interest in her became a running joke among her classmates.“Everybody knew,” she said. “‘Tom Gaddis, oh Tom Gaddis is coming. Caitlin here comes your boyfriend.’ It was normalized by everyone around me that he was a creeper, but nobody really said, ‘Hey, you should really speak out about this,’ or, ‘Hey, this isn’t OK.’ Being so young I had no idea that I had any power and was able to do anything.”As coordinator, Gaddis seemed to be everywhere. Knight’s cohort, a group of students that progress through a degree program together, contained about 20 students, and Gaddis advised them one on one. He also supervised instructors, taught classes and frequently stopped by classrooms and culinary events.Because of the power he wielded, many students believed Gaddis was a dean, three former students said. He’s not. He answers to the dean of Business and Computer Technology; the Hospitality and Culinary Arts programs are concentrations within the school’s two-year Business Administration program.“He’s been at Pellissippi for so long” — two decades — “and he basically made it out like, ‘I’m the manager. I have total control over your grades. I can make you or break you,’” said Anna White, whose last name was Hickey when she was a culinary student at Pellissippi from 2011 to 2013.'Oh, he does that to you, too’White was 22 years old when she was hospitalized and missed her class’s orientation. Gaddis later gave her a one-on-one tour of the University of Tennessee Visitor’s Center on Neyland Drive, where UT instructors teach cooking classes for Pellissippi’s Culinary Arts program. Pellissippi’s website describes the program as a “collaboration” with UT.White said Gaddis suggested she ride with him in his car to the Visitor’s Center. She turned down the offer and drove herself. As soon as she arrived, Gaddis ran over to her and insisted she hold his hand, White said.Throughout her time at Pellissippi, White said Gaddis gave her special treatment, allowing her to redo tests and homework assignments if she made a bad grade.He also gave her long hugs, looked her up and down, and made comments like, “Anna, in another life, I would try to make you my wife,"" White said.Whenever she went to meet with him in his office, White said, “He would always pull me onto his lap and tell me, ‘You know you’re my favorite,’ that kind of thing.”One day when White passed by Gaddis’ office, the door was cracked. White said she looked inside and saw Knight on Gaddis’ lap.“Me and her talked afterward like, ‘Oh, he does that to you, too,’” White said. “We kind of became close. We bonded over that.”White never formally filed a complaint with Pellissippi, but she did talk to the Pellissippi official who investigated Knight’s complaint. She spoke of her experiences with Gaddis then and said she didn’t come forward earlier because she feared Gaddis would retaliate against her.‘Oh, he wants me to change in front of him’At a culinary event at Pellissippi’s Division Street campus in the spring of 2013, Knight said Gaddis approached her and suggested she change her chef’s coat.Knight said Gaddis took her into his office, handed her a spare coat, shut the door, wheeled a chair in front of it, sat down, and looked at her, saying nothing.“I just go, ‘Oh, he wants me to change in front of him,” Knight said.Knight was only wearing a bra underneath her chef’s coat. She said she faced Gaddis and quickly changed into the new coat while “thinking he could not possibly do something right now.""After she finished changing, Knight said Gaddis grabbed her hand and pulled her onto his lap.""I was absolutely panicked and terrified that I was going to be molested in some way,"" she said. ""I felt cold and dead, and he eventually opened his door and was like, 'Well, it's time to get back to the event, you've got to go.' I remember thanking my lucky stars that nothing happened because I think it would have broken me further.""Then, in the fall of 2013, Knight said Gaddis gave her a wedgie when he stopped by Tyler White's cooking class at the University of Tennessee Visitor's Center. Tyler White is a chef at UT’s Culinary Institute who is now married to Anna White.When Carole Gary, Pellissippi’s human resources director, investigated Knight’s complaint in December, she didn’t speak to anyone who could say for sure that they witnessed the wedgie.But Gary did talk to one former student in the class who reported seeing Gaddis’ arm “hanging behind” Knight in the area “of the center of her back and bottom,” Gary wrote in her report. The former student said she couldn’t see what Gaddis was doing but noticed Knight “had a solemn blank stare and looked distressed.”Knight told the former student later that week that Gaddis had reached inside her pants during class, according to Gary’s report.Knight also confided in her then-roommate, Bailey Brown. Brown confirmed that Knight told her in 2013 about the wedgie and about changing in front of Gaddis.‘This is why women don’t tell’Gaddis’ behavior was not just reserved for students.Holly Knowling, a 52-year-old culinary professor at Pellissippi who shared an office suite with Gaddis until recently, said he subjected her for years to unwanted hugs and unwelcome comments.“‘Looking at your butt is the best part of my day,’ was a frequent statement I got,” she said.In 2015, Knowling complained about Gaddis to a coworker, who then reported the conversation to Pellissippi officials.During that conversation, Knowling said Gaddis often gave her hugs, introduced her to colleagues as his “wife at work,” initiated conversations “of a sexual nature,” constantly asked her to lunch, and frequently had closed-door meetings with female students.Knowling told the USA TODAY NETWORK – Tennessee that she didn’t tell her coworker everything Gaddis had said and done. She said she didn’t know the coworker would report the conversation, and she didn’t file a complaint herself because she feared retribution.“It was very uncomfortable with the way academia is set up,” Knowling said. “He is the program coordinator, so he’s not my boss, but he does make my schedule and sort of outlines every single thing I do, and I shared an office with him. It’s pretty unrealistic to think that wouldn’t be super uncomfortable.”In September 2015, Knowling and Gaddis agreed to meet with a Pellissippi official to resolve the complaint. Gaddis acknowledged Knowling’s “concerns and committed to not repeat the behaviors,” an investigative report reads.“Both parties stated they were satisfied with this outcome.”Pellissippi, Gaddis respondKnight’s complaint came more than two years later, but her allegations dated back to 2013 and 2014 — before Knowling’s complaint.Although Pellissippi officials found Gaddis had sexually harassed Knight, they decided his actions “were not a continuation of previously warned against behavior,” Carole Gary, Pellissippi’s human resources director, wrote in an email.“We feel that appropriate action was to issue a warning and require Dr. Gaddis to alter his work habits and undergo training,” Gary continued. “It is our belief that Dr. Gaddis corrected any inappropriate interactions in 2015.”Gaddis remains the coordinator of Pellissippi's Culinary Arts program but is no longer the coordinator for the Hospitality program. That decision was not disciplinary, as it was made in September 2017, before Knight's complaint was filed, Gary said.A written reprimand issued to Gaddis in April details Pellissippi’s response:Gaddis is not to touch students or faculty members unless it is required by the curriculum.Gaddis is not to give students rides in his car. He can give students rides in a college vehicle for college events if there is more than one student in the vehicle.Gaddis is not to have closed-door meetings with students.Gaddis is to complete sexual harassment training twice a year.Gaddis is to restrict his visits to the UT Culinary Institute, based on terms decided by his boss. (Gaddis is currently banned from UT’s campus.)Pellissippi officials will conduct sexual harassment and misconduct training for all culinary and hospitality students each semester.When reached by email, Gaddis did not acknowledge interview requests and instead sent the following statement about Knight’s allegations:“In late 2017 several accusations were made against me concerning conduct that was alleged to have occurred between 2012 and 2014. I vigorously denied the allegations throughout the investigation process. In the end, I reluctantly chose to accept a written reprimand in lieu of continuing in my legal defense and incurring substantial legal costs.“I am committed to following the steps outlined in the written reprimand and will strive to do my part to make the Culinary Program open and welcoming to all students and faculty, and free from any manner of discriminatory conduct.”Gaddis did not respond to follow-up emails asking about the other women who accused him of sexual harassment.‘The domino effect’Knight left Knoxville in 2014 and moved back home to Franklin, Tennessee. She’s now raising her toddler son and working toward becoming a certified life coach.Last year, Knight watched as the #MeToo movement empowered women across the country to share their stories of being sexually harassed and abused by powerful men.She thought about Gaddis.And she decided to speak out, she said, ""to go all the way until this man is in no way around students that he could potentially harm physically or mentally.""“The emotional ride that you go on, through shaming yourself and feeling guilty and suppressing it and rationalizing it and the issues that spur from that, the domino effect, is really extensive,"" Knight said.""Nobody deserves to go through that. And if I can help it, then nobody will.”Update: After this story was published, Pellissippi President L. Anthony Wise sent the following email to students, faculty and staff: ""By now, I am sure many of you have seen the article posted online today by the News Sentinel. I want to reassure you that we take allegations of sexual harassment such as this seriously. As you know, we support a safe campus environment and have procedures in place for anyone to report any violations. We encourage individuals who believe their rights have been violated to speak up and make their concerns formally known.""Reach Travis Dorman at travis.dorman@knoxnews.com or on Twitter @travdorman. "
https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2018/08/10/pellissippi-sexual-harassment-investigator-quit-after-harassing-woman/873288002/,"The man who previously investigated allegations of sexual harassment at Pellissippi State Community College abruptly left the school last year after an investigation found he himself had sexually harassed a woman, documents show.Pellissippi hired John Patrick Shipwash in May 2015 to fill a new role: executive director of Equity and Compliance. In a recent letter published in the News Sentinel, Pellissippi President Anthony Wise touted the creation of the position as a positive step toward addressing sexual harassment on campus.Shipwash seemed a good fit at the time. He'd worked as an investigator for two decades, recently coming out of retirement to oversee internal investigations at the Tennessee Department of Human Services. Cases of sexual harassment and discrimination, he told Wise, were his specialties.Less than 2½ years later, though, Shipwash found the roles reversed and himself under investigation. He faced a choice: resign or be fired.Previous coverage:Three women accused this Pellissippi professor of sexual harassment. He still has his job.Previous coverage:Pellissippi professor steps down from coordinator position after sexual harassment report'Am I mortified to this day? Absolutely'A woman reported to the Tennessee Board of Regents on Aug. 2, 2017, that Shipwash visited her off campus in May 2016. She said he drank heavily and began speaking unprompted about his “sexual experiences and preferences,” according to an investigative report released by Pellissippi in response to a public records request.She said Shipwash rubbed her back under her shirt, put his head on her stomach, and tried to massage her shoulders without her consent. Each time he touched her, she ""verbally and physically rebuked"" him, the report reads. The woman's name is redacted along with other details that could be used to identify her.Shipwash told the investigator he had been drinking whiskey and couldn't remember everything that happened that day. He said he had never known the woman, whom he once considered a friend, to lie or make things up.Discipline came swiftly after the investigation concluded on Aug. 30. The next day, Shipwash was called into a meeting with Wise and Carole Gary, the human resources director who would soon assume his responsibilities.""They told me that I had the option of resigning if I didn’t want to be terminated,"" Shipwash said in a recent phone interview. ""I opted to resign.""Shipwash, 66, admitted he exercised ""extremely poor judgment"" and ""acted inappropriately"" toward his accuser.""It was alcohol-sparked, and that’s that,"" he said. ""Am I mortified to this day? Absolutely. But am I going to try to evade responsibility for it? No.""'Nobody knows what happened'Two days after the investigation concluded, on Sept. 1, Wise sent out a faculty-wide email saying Shipwash was no longer employed at Pellissippi. The president offered no explanation, which only fueled speculation among faculty members.“Nobody says anything about it, and nobody knows what happened,” said Rick Oster, an accounting professor who’s worked at Pellissippi for 25 years. “We thought (Shipwash) probably misapplied a policy or something. We never thought he did anything personally wrong.”The revelation raises more questions about the culture inside the largest community college in East Tennessee. It follows news that Pellissippi did not fire or suspend longtime program coordinator and tenured professor Tom Gaddis after three women told college officials he sexually harassed them on campus.The school’s own investigation, conducted months after Shipwash left, found Gaddis sexually harassed Caitlin Knight when she was a student in his culinary program from 2012 to 2014. Knight reported that Gaddis once told her to change her chef’s coat in front of him while he blocked the only exit in his office, and that he later reached inside her pants and gave her a wedgie in a classroom at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville.Gaddis’ punishment was a reprimand; Wise said administrators ""took action based upon the facts that we could prove in the case."" It was only after the News Sentinel published a story about the finding against Gaddis that he stepped down from his position as culinary program coordinator and said he will take medical leave in the fall. He remains employed.'Old guys just do this'Shipwash said he was ""beside himself"" when he read the recent stories about Gaddis — in part because he investigated Gaddis in 2015. That year culinary professor Holly Knowling spoke about Gaddis to a co-worker, who was obligated to report the conversation to Shipwash.Knowling told Shipwash that Gaddis subjected her to unwanted hugs, uncomfortable comments and unsolicited conversations about how often two people should have sex to maintain a healthy relationship. She also reported Gaddis frequently closed his office door when meeting alone with female students.Shipwash held a meeting with Gaddis and Knowling, and Gaddis said he would change his behavior. Pellissippi administrators have said they don’t know of any misconduct since then; Knight's allegations against Gaddis predate that conversation.Knowling said she found Shipwash to be ""appropriate and fair,"" but one comment he made gave her pause.""He said in some form that, 'Old guys just do this. I don't think Tom realizes what he's doing,' "" Knowling said. ""I did a big eye roll inside when he said that.""In a separate interview, Catherine Carr said she was an assistant in Pellissippi's service learning program when a different male faculty member sent her an email she found to be sexually suggestive. She said that when she reported it, Shipwash told her, ""Men that age are from a different time. I told him you can't do stuff like that anymore.""When asked about the comments, Shipwash suggested he was misunderstood.""What I said was ... back before women started asserting their rights, men got away with a lot more, and some guys are unwilling to change,"" he said.Despite the harassment finding against Shipwash, administrators believe all of his investigations at Pellissippi adhered to state guidelines, according to a statement provided by Pellissippi's marketing director, Julia Wood.'You have to have evidence'Why did Shipwash face termination while Gaddis didn't?Investigations found both men had sexually harassed a woman — Gaddis on campus, Shipwash off campus. A Tennessee Board of Regents official investigated Shipwash, whereas a Pellissippi official handled the Gaddis investigation. Gaddis denied the allegations and said he accepted a reprimand only to avoid legal fees. Shipwash said he couldn't recall what happened, so he couldn't dispute the allegations against him.Shipwash said he believes Pellissippi treated Gaddis with favoritism because he's been a fixture there for two decades and is friendly with administrators, while he, by comparison, was an ""outsider.""Pellissippi, on the other hand, maintains the disciplinary action taken in each case came after administrators reviewed the relevant policies and consulted with legal counsel from the Tennessee Board of Regents. Wood said Shipwash ""faced termination because the investigation revealed that he had taken actions which undermined his ability to effectively perform his job"" as an employee tasked with preventing and investigating cases of sexual harassment.One significant difference between the two men is that Gaddis has tenure, while Shipwash did not. The form of job protection has grown more controversial in recent years.""Tenured and tenure-track faculty members and support staff have statutory job protections that administrative personnel and non-tenured faculty do not have,"" Wood said.Wise, the school's president, visited a Faculty Senate meeting last month along with HR director Carole Gary, who investigated Knight's complaint against Gaddis, and Annazette Houston, who replaced Shipwash as director of Equity and Compliance. The trio fielded questions from faculty members about how the college handles allegations of sexual harassment.Gary said the process for firing a tenured professor such as Gaddis requires a higher standard of proof than the type of investigation that found him guilty. She said the standard of proof for that investigation was, ""Is it more likely than not that these things happened?""To fire a tenured professor, however, ""You have to be able to prove that these things happened,"" Gary said. ""You have to have evidence that these things happened, and that's very difficult to do, particularly a long time later.""After the administrators left the room, some faculty members spoke more openly. They grappled with the issues surrounding harassment in academia. They asked questions about how to foster an environment that encourages students to report abuse. They discussed a proposed resolution regarding sexual harassment but set it aside after some attendees suggested the language was too vague.And they left that day, not knowing about Shipwash.Reach Travis Dorman at travis.dorman@knoxnews.com or on Twitter @travdorman.   "

BRYANT — A former college professor fired after he was accused of stalking a student and was convicted of animal abuse, was reassigned Wednesday from his job at the Alexander Youth Services Center after an official with the state Department of Human Services was questioned about his position.
""We are informing Mr. [Curtis Ray] Freeman this afternoon that he will be moved from his Youth Services Worker II position to a position that does not involve direct contact with juveniles,"" department spokesman Joe Quinn said after he was contacted by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
Freeman, 36, of Little Rock declined to comment Wednesday on his reassignment.
The Youth Services Division of the Department of Human Services hired Freeman in December to work with delinquent children at its detention center near Bryant, Quinn said. The agency conducted a criminal background check on Freeman before he was hired, Quinn said.
""We got some misdemeanor hits,"" Quinn said of the background check, but he did not know the specifics of those misdemeanors until this week.
Freeman was accused of stalking and harassing Anita Johnson, 41, of Little Rock while he was a history professor at Philander Smith College. The woman, a student who worked at the school, told authorities at the time that she had dated Freeman for about a month. She claimed he began stalking and tormenting her with disturbing telephone calls after she ended their relationship, and that he physically threatened her.
The college fired Freeman shortly before his arrest last October.
A municipal judge later ordered Freeman to stay away from the woman for a year or face up to 10 days in jail. Freeman's attorney said the misdemeanor charge eventually would be dismissed.
Freeman pleaded guilty in October to misdemeanor animal abuse and was ordered to serve a 10-day jail sentence. In addition, the judge ordered him to pay $1,279.50 in restitution and a $1,000 fine.
Authorities had earlier found his pet chow emaciated, dehydrated and unable to walk. It died at an animal hospital.
Quinn said misdemeanor convictions do not necessarily prevent a person from being hired by the department.
However, when asked if a person with Freeman's background should have a position supervising children, he said, ""I'm not going to comment on that. That would be subjective.""
However, ""all of this is being checked as we speak,"" he said. The department's lawyers are reviewing ""the specifics of the hiring and what was found on the background search.""
The reassignment is the latest in a string of events that has brought critical attention to juvenile services in Arkansas. In June, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette published a series of articles detailing allegations of abuse and mismanagement at some of the division's facilities, leading to a shake-up within the Youth Services Division.
The detention center, located near Bryant, also has been the scene of some recent escapes, attacks on employees and incidents of workers sleeping on the job.

http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/20221749/pima-college-settled-sexual-harrassment-claim,"TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - Pima Community College settled a sexual harassment lawsuit against its former Chancellor, Roy Flores.KOLD News 13 got word of that Wednesday.We also learned this week that an education watchdog group will conduct a fact-finding investigation on such allegations and other alleged issues at the college.The Higher Learning Commission also is looking into allegations of retaliation against employees, and claims the governing board and some senior administrators did not handle allegations properly.This investigation is significant because this is the group that accredits colleges, and the HLC is  looking to see if PCC is worthy of continued accreditation.The HLC will send investigators to the college early next year.PCC Governing Board Chairman Scott Stewart says there were eight sexual harassment complaints made this year by current and former employees, but all allegedly occurred years ago.He says the statute of limitations ran out on seven of them, but the college settled with an eighth alleged victim.Stewart referred further questions about this case to the board's lawyer.We are waiting for details from the attorney.We asked Stewart why all the allegations were not investigated.""There were anonymous letters indicating non-specific inappropriate conduct, the kind of thing that's impossible to investigate. We referred those to our board attorney, and he agreed that there was nothing that could be done without something specific and people going on the record,"" Stewart told us.The former chancellor, Flores, has denied wrongdoing.He cited health reasons when he retired earlier this year.We are attempting to contact him.Stewart says he agrees there are what he calls weaknesses at the college, including how contracts have been awarded, but he says they are being addressed.Stewart says he welcomes an independent outside investigation, and expects the college to be cleared.However, he says he is very concerned about the college's reputation.Stewart says he's worried about the impact on its reputation among students, parents and taxpayers, and especially now that it is searching for a new chancellor.""I'm worried about that it will take longer to get someone on board, that ... the environment that we're in right now will potentially chase away good candidates who want to continue making improvements in education. That's my number one concern,"" Stewart says.The HLC has the power to require monitoring of the college if it finds anything inappropriate.Stewart says the problems at the college do not, ""rise to the level where you withdraw accreditation. I don't think they even come close to that.""Copyright 2012 Tucson News Now. All rights reserved."
http://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/050114_pcc_bia/pccs-bia-resigns-over-sexual-harassment-allegations/,"
Longtime Pima Community College administrator Johnson Bia is resigning after a school investigation into female employees' allegations of sexual harassment found his behavior violated college policies.A college report said Bia ""consistently leers at female subordinate staff,"" made inappropriate comments and hugged female but not male staff.Bia, who has worked at Pima for 22 years, has immediately stepped aside as president of the Desert Vista Campus and will retire on June 3.""It is critical that all PCC employees feel free to express their concerns about potentially difficult workplace situations. No matter what you do or where you work at PCC, there should be no barrier to open and honest communication,"" college Chancellor Lee Lambert said in an email to employees announcing Bia's retirement.""I have simply concluded it is time to move on,"" Bia said in an email he sent to all Pima employees. He did not address the allegations.Pima is working to straighten out a laundry list of administrative troubles pointed out by the Higher Learning Commission. That accrediting body placed the community college on probation last year, citing in part the poor handling of allegations that former chancellor Roy Flores sexually harassed female employees.According to an internal report released Thursday by the school, Pima's staff attorney and director of Employee Relations interviewed a female employee in February after she alleged that Bia was engaging in ""inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature.""The woman, whose identity and position at the school were redacted from the report, told Pima officials that ""Bia is 'eerie and creepy' and she feels like she needs to take a shower every day after work"" and that she was ""hurt and offended as well as grossed out.""

The woman, referred to as ""the Complainant"" in the report, told school investigators that she was at times not going into work to avoid encountering Bia.The Complainant told Pima's general counsel, Jeff Silvyn, and Employee Relations Director Alison Colter-Mack that she was prompted to report her concerns about Bia after he told her ""it just smells so good"" after taking a whiff of her perfume.The Complainant told the college's investigators that ""Bia works innuendo into every conversation they have,"" the 24-page report said.""Are you on the menu?,"" Bia once asked her as she worked on a listing of foods to be prepared for a college event, she told investigators.The woman told Silvyn and Colter-Mack about an incident in early February when she ""she drove back to campus to get her phone charger that she had left in the office. She saw his car in the parking lot and stayed in her car because she was scared to run into him. Instead of taking the chance of running into him she just went to a store and purchased a new charger,"" the report said.Another female employee, identified only in the report as Witness A, told investigators that Bia would hug her, had asked her about her dating preferences, that she had ""caught Bia taking pictures of her back to side profile"" while she was doing her hair at work, and that had he was ""scared to death"" when she ran into Bia and his wife at a department store.Witness A said that she ""no longer goes to the (Board of Governors) meetings because she does not want to run into Bia,"" the report said.Another female employee told investigators that she ""knows that the Complainant was afraid and there is still fear for a lot of people even though the chancellor says things are changing.""Another employee, Witness C, told investigators that she felt Bia looked at her as if she were naked:In November 2013, there was a dress that she used to wear. Bia made a comment that the dress was ""sexy."" She thought that he was trying to tell her the dress was inappropriate, but she did not think that the dress was inappropriate for work. The witness went on to say that this comment was in passing ""like he was trying to make a joke."" She stated, however, that she got an ""icky, gross feeling"" and ended up going home to change her dress. Witness C asserted that following this, she has never worn the dress again. She stated that overall, the way that Bia looks at people; he makes you feel ""gross"" and uncomfortable. ... She explained further that sometimes she feels ""naked"" by the way that Bia looks at her.

Of another employee, Witness E, the report said:It is the witness's contention that Bia has ""leered"" at her as well. Bia never made eye contact with her (the witness), but was always looking at her breasts or lower private part. If she was wearing jeans, Bia would look at her crotch; if she was wearing a dress, he would look at her breasts. Witness E asserted that she would always cover the areas that he was focused on noting that he would never turn away and would continue to leer. She added that if she were called into his work area or when she saw him; she would cover the area that he was leering at – her breasts or her crotch with a folder or anything she had in her hand. The witness told the Complainant ""this is what I do when he looks at me."" She showed the Complainant how she covers the area that Bia is focused on. She went on to say, however, that Bia has never made any inappropriate comments to her. She added, however, that every time she would walk into his area, it felt as if he was looking her up and down.Bia told investigators that the employee identified as the Complainant in the report was on probation because of an investigation into an incident, that nature of which was redacted from the college's report. ""The Complainant's timesheets show a pattern of absences, annual and sick leave,"" the report said.The report said that according to a Witness F, ""Complainant would have absences at times that seemed odd such as she would call in sick after taking her lunch hour.""Bia, who was paid $168,000 annually, told investigators the Complainant ""may have brought forward this complaint against him because he was holding her accountable for her absenteeism,"" the report said.Witness E told investigators that ""the Complainant has expressed to her that she is uncomfortable and that she (the Complainant) will also make excuses not to be there or leave for lunch when Bia is there. She went on to say that the Complainant has apologized to her for not coming into work because she did not want to be around Bia.""According the the report's summary, ""evidence consistently showed that Bia did engage in flirtatious behavior with young female subordinate staff that was neither welcomed nor wanted. Witnesses asserted that Biawould pry and probe into their personal lives; make comments and ask questions that were not related to his role of Campus President.""""The evidence, as presented, does not meet the threshold of actionable sexual harassment; however, the behavior exhibited by Bia in his position of Campus President toward subordinate staff violates College policy, and does not fit within the standard that has been set for College employees and executive administrators in particular,"" the report said.From the report's summary:Evidence supports that Bia has repeatedly made inappropriate comments not only to the Complainant, but also to other subordinate female employees within the organization. The preponderance of evidence suggests that Bia has commented on female subordinate staff personal attire, personal lives, and other areas that cross the superordinate/subordinate threshold. Moreover, there was substantial evidence suggesting that Bia consistently leers at female subordinate staff that makes them feel uncomfortable.Based upon the evidence presented, it can be reasonably argued that
Bia's behavior rose to the level of improper and unprofessional, and as
such, the Complainant and witnesses, as noted by several of them, were
fearful of coming forward because of Bia's position of Campus President.
Moreover, Bia's behavior lends itself to that of positional power over
subordinate staff which may have contributed to their fear. As noted
during the investigation, Bia acted as if he was untouchable and people
began to believe that he was.Lambert, who now finds his college with four of six campus presidencies vacant, told employees that, ""As you know, concerns were recently raised about Dr. Bia’s professional conduct. The College looked into them and, as a result, Johnson and I agreed that it was in everyone’s best interest that he retires at this time.""""As public servants, we all must be mindful that our conduct must be held to the highest standards. A goal we should all share as PCC employees is to maintain the highest level of professionalism,"" Lambert said.

Prairie View AM University Professor J.D. Oliver, who allegedly tried to have sex with a failing student in a hotel, is now embroiled in a pair of lawsuits and claims he is a victim of robbery and attempted extortion.
In the winter 2013 semester, Lisa Mims, a student who was failing Oliver’s computer science class, asked her then-professor, 76, for guidance. Oliver allegedly was going to help her receive an A for the class, but in exchange for alleged sexual favors.
According to ABC13 Los Angeles, Mims had approached her teacher for help several times and he once grabbed her breast and told her to meet him in a hotel.
""He wasn't going to give me a grade unless I showed up at the hotel and had sex with him,"" Mims said on an interview with ABC13 reporter Angela Chen.
Oliver allegedly arranged a private, off-campus meeting with Mims at a Best Western hotel; however, he told police he was there because his carpets were being cleaned at home and needed a place to grade assignments. Oliver also claims that Mims borrowed a couple of his books and he only invited her to his hotel because it was convenient for her.
Mims arrived at the hotel with her boyfriend and two other males. Mims told ABC13 that they confronted Oliver and he begged them to leave.
However, Oliver's lawyer, Debra Jennings, told reporters that more happened afterwards. Oliver said that the four of them robbed him of his car keys, cell phone, money, and credit cards. He also told police that Mims attempted to extort $9,000.
The university has investigated the case and, after finding evidence supporting Mims's claims, fired Oliver.
Both the student and former teacher have filed a lawsuit against each other, but a grand jury has not charged Mims with robbery.

https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/princeton-professor-sexual-harassment-not-punished_us_5a01d203e4b0368a4e872655,"A graduate student at Princeton University says that engineering professor Sergio Verdu sexually harassed her over the course of two months and, despite being found responsible, was required only to attend a training as punishment.Yeohee Im was 23 when she left her hometown of Busan, South Korea, to travel halfway across the world to work with Verdu, a renowned electrical engineering professor.In August 2015, Im enrolled in Princeton University’s electrical engineering graduate program. She had recently finished her master’s in South Korea and was excited to learn from Verdu, a tenured professor who had won dozens of awards for his work in the electrical engineering and information theory fields. She began working with Verdu during her second semester at Princeton in January 2016, when he became one of her thesis advisers. It wasn’t until a year later, Im says, that Verdu began behaving inappropriately toward her. According to documents obtained by HuffPost, in April Im filed a sexual harassment complaint against Verdu with Princeton’s Title IX office, which deals with issues of gender discrimination. The complaint came after two incidents in February and March, when Verdu allegedly sexually harassed Im in his home while the two were alone, touching her upper thigh and stomach during two incidents. After a two-month investigation, Princeton found Verdu “responsible for sexual harassment,” but he was not suspended or terminated from his position, according to documents obtained by HuffPost.Verdu responded to the accusations in a statement to HuffPost: “The university advised me not to reply but I categorically deny that there were any advances or any sexual harassment.”According to Im, Verdu’s punishment was to attend an “eight-hour training” session, and he is teaching at Princeton this semester. Princeton declined to comment to HuffPost on the details of Im’s case or the type of punishment Verdu received but said that “when a member of the University community is found responsible for violating our sexual misconduct policy, a range of penalties may be imposed.”After the Title IX investigation, Im said she began hearing about other women who Verdu had behaved inappropriately toward. The dean of faculty at Princeton, Deborah Prentice, admitted in a recording obtained by HuffPost that there was “a broader set of allegations” made against Verdu by other women but that no one was willing to come forward on record.Because of these other allegations and her own experiences, Im believes Princeton did not do enough to penalize Verdu. “In that moment, I was just panicking.” Im had been to Verdu’s house once before to watch a soccer game, so she didn’t think much of it when he invited her over to watch a movie in February. However, she was a little nervous that he had chosen the Korean film “The Handmaiden” for them to watch, which is known for its sexually explicit story. Im texted one of her classmates to get advice: “My advisor asked me to watch some movie at his place. But I think he asked that only to me. I am not totally sure but last time he and I watched soccer and no one else was there. It is weird.”“Prof. Verdu? Um.. if it’s only you two, that does not sound good..,” her classmate responded. Im says she emailed Verdu a few days before they were supposed to meet asking if they could watch something less sexually explicit. “I was curious about the movie handmaiden so I googled it,” Im wrote to Verdu in an email obtained by HuffPost. “It seems to have explicit contents and I am usually not good at watching those. How about we watch another Korean popular movie or anything else you like?” According to the emails, Verdu responded that he wanted to see something by that director but Netflix only offered “The Handmaiden.” Im acquiesced and agreed to watch “The Handmaiden.”After class on Feb. 23, Im says she approached Verdu asking when he wanted to leave to watch the film. “He led her outside of the room and suggested that they meet in the parking lot, in her opinion, because he ‘didn’t want anyone to hear,’” according to a Title IX complaint report obtained by HuffPost. When they arrived at Verdu’s home, Im says they poured some drinks and turned on the movie. Im says she sat at the edge of one of the two couches in Verdu’s living room. Verdu chose to sit on the same couch and sat “right next to [her]” with their “arms touching at least some of the time,” according to Im.While the movie was playing, Im says Verdu asked if she had a boyfriend and put his arm around her shoulder for “a short time.” Im says she was very confused and started to panic. “It was happening in his home,” she said. “And right in front of me there was a photo of him and his daughter. I was panicking, can this be sexual harassment? I know that his daughter is a similar age to me. I was wondering, is he doing this because I am a similar age to his daughter? In that moment, I was just panicking.” After the film ended, Im headed home a little shaken and confused about what had just happened. She said she knew something felt wrong, but she didn’t know what to do.Fast forward to the 2:40 mark to see Verdu featured in the welcome video for the electrical engineering graduate program. A week later, on March 9, Verdu reached out to Im again asking if she wanted to watch a movie titled “Old Boy,” which was directed by the same person who directed “The Handmaiden.” During this email exchange, obtained by HuffPost, Verdu told Im to “please call me Sergio,” along with a smiling emoji. Im still didn’t know what to think about the previous incident, so she agreed to watch another movie with Verdu. She hoped that Verdu’s behavior toward her had been a misunderstanding. “The power imbalance is extreme.”On March 10, Verdu drove Im to his home, where, according to the Title IX complaint, they each drank two glasses of red wine. During the movie, Im says, Verdu told her she was “drinking too slowly.” The Title IX complaint outlines what happened next, according to Im:During the movie, [Verdu] “made a joke” about a sex scene in the movie, saying, “that was fast,” implying they had sex quickly. While they were watching the movie, his right arm was “wrapped around [her] shoulders,” such that his armpit was touching her shoulder, with his right hand on her shoulder. While his arm was around her shoulders, he was “softly brushing his hand up and down” on her shoulder, “like [people] do when they want to arouse each other.”Im said she realized she had spilled some red wine on her white sweatshirt. When she attempted to get it off, Im said, Verdu came over with soap and a napkin and tried to clean it off himself. She kept telling him it was a cheap shirt and he didn’t need to bother, but he proceeded to try to clean the stain on the stomach area of her shirt for “more than 30 seconds.” When Im tried to move her shirt away from her stomach so Verdu wouldn’t touch her stomach outside of her shirt, he put his hand inside her shirt, touching the bottom of her bra with his hand as he attempted to clean the wine stain, she said. “You don’t have to do this,” Im told Verdu. Then, according to Im, Verdu put his hand on her thigh next to her underwear line. He left his hand there “for a long time,” Im said, around a minute. Im says she stood up in order to get out of the situation and said she needed to use the bathroom. “I kept asking myself, is he doing this because he’s from Barcelona?” Im said, referring to the fact that Verdu is from Spain. “Is this OK in Barcelona? Maybe it’s different than in Korea.” Genie Harrison, a sexual harassment and assault victim rights lawyer who regularly deals with Title IX cases, told HuffPost that Verdu’s actions are typical “grooming” behavior, which often consists of “touching a thigh, touching a hand ... talking about his own sex life.” Harrison added that Im’s relationship with her professor is a precarious one because graduate professors have so much power over their students’ success (as we’ve seen with other graduate students and professors). “The power imbalance is extreme in a situation like this. This is her adviser who basically has control over her ability to succeed in this graduate program, and her ability to get papers published and get a job in the business world,” Harrison told HuffPost. “Everything is hanging on this relationship, which is unique, I think, to a graduate degree adviser and student. Everything is riding on this person helping you and continuing to support you in your graduate studies.”“If I hadn’t done anything, other students would be in the same danger I was.”The morning after Im got home from Verdu’s house she wrote him an email telling him she was not comfortable with what happened the night before. “After I came home, I realized I wasn’t comfortable with you touching my leg. I consider our relationship solely as advisor and student and would appreciate if you do so,” she wrote. “I think it would be nice to set some boundaries.” Verdu responded that he agreed and asked if they could meet in person to discuss. Although she still felt uncomfortable, Im says her relationship with Verdu was cordial and professional after their discussion, and the two continued working together. Im told another professor what had happened with Verdu a few weeks later, and that professor ended up reporting her story to Princeton’s Title IX office. On April 13, both Im and Verdu were notified that there would be a Title IX investigation into the two incidents.Almost two months later, on June 9, Princeton’s Title IX office emailed Im notifying her that the investigation was complete. The panel found Verdu “responsible for sexual harassment” but Verdu was not suspended or terminated.Princeton’s Title IX coordinator, Michele Minter, sent a letter, obtained by HuffPost, to Im detailing the investigation’s findings. The investigation found Verdu “responsible” for violating Princeton’s policy on sex discrimination and sexual misconduct and determined that “discipline is warranted.” According to Im, Verdu’s “discipline” was an eight-hour training session. Im met with the Prentice; the school’s Title IX administrator, Regan Crotty; and one of Im’s other advisers and the dean of the graduate school, Meghan Krause, to discuss the Title IX office’s findings. Prentice told Im that Verdu’s conduct didn’t call for his termination. “In connection with you, [Verdu] clearly behaved highly inappropriately, there’s no question, and that’s why there was a penalty,” Prentice told Im in the meeting, a recording of which was obtained by HuffPost. “But when you indicated to him that he was behaving inappropriately he stopped and took no further action, so under those circumstances, and given that we were treating it as a first-time offense, it doesn’t warrant his termination.”While Im said she’s not comfortable talking about the other allegations against Verdu, she feels that “he’s going to do the same thing” to other women. “Before I shared my experience with other students, no one was able to find out that he had been charged with sexual harassment except for a few university officers,” Im said. “If I hadn’t done anything, other students would be in the same danger I was. A penalty should have a preventive effect. If the university had suspended him even for a short period of time, students would know he had been suspended and it would reduce the chances that any more students are harassed.” Harrison told HuffPost that she wouldn’t be surprised if Verdu had done this to other students. “This is, I believe, a really serious case,” she said. “I think that something significant should’ve been done if [Im’s] allegations were substantiated. In my experience, people who do this have done this before.” When contacted by HuffPost, Princeton spokesperson Michael Hotchkiss said the university could not comment on Verdu’s penalty and issued the following statement: The University takes any accusation of sexual misconduct very seriously, investigates thoroughly, and takes appropriate action based on our findings. We are committed to providing an inclusive and welcoming educational and working environment for all members of our community. When a member of the University community is found responsible for violating our sexual misconduct policy, a range of penalties may be imposed based on the facts of the case, including but not limited to warning, probation, loss of leave or other privileges, suspension and dismissal. We require counseling and training for every individual found to have violated our policy, with the goal of stopping inappropriate behavior.The details of specific Title IX investigations are kept confidential to respect the privacy of parties involved and the witnesses who provide information. In this case, penalties were imposed in addition to the required counseling.Importantly, in sexual misconduct cases we also focus on providing support and necessary resources to victims to facilitate their continued success at the University.Harrison believes that Princeton’s disciplinary actions are “woefully insufficient.” “I think Princeton is exposing itself to a major, major potential exposure and financial consequences if this guy does this again,” she said. “Because the message to him is we’re going to slap you on the wrist and we’re going to keep it quiet. You’re not going to lose your job. We’re not going to have a big public hearing. His behavior is extremely alarming and Princeton’s actions against him, to me, are woefully insufficient.”After the Title IX investigation was completed, Im switched advisers and stopped attending Verdu’s classes. She ended up changing her focus of study because she said she “would be too nervous to be in the same field as [Verdu] is.” She also told HuffPost that since the harassment occurred she has begun seeing a therapist and taking antidepressants. She also said that she still has to see Verdu every day because they work in the same building. “Although it is not easy to share how I was taken advantage of, I am speaking out,” Im said. “Because I hope more people become aware of how dangerous sexual harassment is, so they can avoid the same situation. I hope this story can give the university a lesson on what kind of actions they have to take in order to protect victims and prevent this from happening again.” Support HuffPostThe Stakes Have Never Been HigherAt HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

http://q30tv.com/q30-news/professor-removed-after-sending-inappropriate-emails-to-students/,"  
By Cali Kees and Joel Vanner
A part-time faculty member in the College of Arts  Sciences was abruptly dismissed from Quinnipiac Tuesday after students reported he had been sending them numerous emails that sought romantic relationships.
Students in former part-time faculty member Tcho Caulker’s evening QU 301 class were told via email Tuesday at 5:11 p.m. that he is no longer at Quinnipiac. The action occurred after current and former students reported that Caulker sent them messages they described as inappropriate to the university’s Department of Public Safety.
A screenshot of the email sent to students in Professor Caulker’s QU301 class following his removal from the university.
Public safety officers removed Caulker from his morning class in Tator Hall at 11:15 a.m.
Q30 News reached out to Caulker using the Gmail in which he reached out to his students on for a statement, in which he replied and attached the following:

The latest known email to six women, including five current or former Quinnipiac students and one at Eastern Connecticut State University, contained language that suggested he sought a romantic relationship with a specific Quinnipiac alumna.
Q30 News interviewed one of the women who received emails from Caulker. She asked for and was granted anonymity for this article but agreed to be interviewed and recorded by phone to tell her side of the story.

https://q30tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Audio_Answer_1.mp3
 
The woman said she enrolled in the QU 301 class for the 2016-2017 academic year, and Caulker began sending her multiple emails per day after she graduated from Quinnipiac.
“He had been messaging me personally for over 11 months sending me more than three messages, like long paragraphs, a day,” she said. “Nothing worrisome at first and then just one day everything took a turn.”
Caulker discussed his life and how he wanted to be with her.
“He would do anything to get my attention and he started sending me pictures of his house and booking plane flights for me and sending me gifts and… just all this stuff and I thought it had gone too far,” she explained.
At first, she thought she could just ignore the emails but, after 11 months of receiving emails from Caulker, she began to realize that she was not the only one receiving these romantic emails.
Occasionally Caulker would send “mass” emails to multiple women. She decided to bring the emails that she had been receiving to Quinnipiac’s Department of Public Safety in hopes that they would become aware of the situation, and if a situation like this were to start to arise in the future it could be prevented.
“Once I brought it to QU’s attention everyone else started bringing it to QU’s attention and all these emails started coming out that have acquired over the past three years, I think,” she said.
After this was brought to Quinnipiac’s attention, she explained that the school did what they thought was appropriate.
“I believe QU from my understanding had received emails from him as well saying that he knew where me and some of my friends worked, where we lived, things like that,” she said. “They were starting to get concerned for our safety and the safety of the other, our other friends and other people on the campus.”
https://q30tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Audio_Answer_2.mp3
 
The women receiving emails from Caulker did not receive only one or a few.
“I personally received over 300 emails from him,” she said. “I’m not positive about everyone else but I know everyone else had received multiple emails.”
Even after the women had asked him to stop he continued to email every one of them.
“I know the other girls had asked him nicely to stop and he never stopped for any of us,” she explained.
https://q30tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Audio_Answer_3.mp3
 
Throughout these alleged three years of emails, she believes that no one that has received these kinds of emails from Caulker has come forward before. She believes that the University may have some reports of odd interactions students have had with Caulker, but nothing to this extent.
“They had like little details from the past nothing as…he hasn’t taken it as far with the other girls as he has with us,” she said.

Emailing is not the only form of contact that Caulker has attempted to make with these women.
“I personally have received multiple requests on Facebook, on Instagram, on Twitter, on Snapchat, he has found on text me app. He had found me on every social media,” she said.

While this woman had Caulker as a Professor for her QU 301 class, others who have received emails have not.
Caulker served as her professor in QU 301 and found him to be “a really sweet like normal guy, everything,” she said.
She explained that she never really had a special bond with him in class.
“I never was a teacher’s pet, I never went to office hours,” she said.
Despite not having any sort of special bond, the emails started after graduation.
She did not have a different experience in Caulker’s class than any of his students from this semester.  The Q30 News Team went to Caulker’s former 6:30 p.m. lecture to speak to students about their reaction to Caulker’s removal as well as what their perception of him was as their professor.
“I never got any inappropriate or overwhelming vibes from him. But he definitely is a very passionate guy about what he teaches and about us pursuing our goals…so I do see how that could be possibly misinterpreted,” senior Alexandra Halaris said.
Shaina Bauersachs, another student in the class, mirrored Halaris’ opinion.
“I was surprised but not, like, shocked because he was always…I mean, he was really nice and understanding but I could see where that could be misunderstood,” Bauersachs said.

Our source, who wished to remain anonymous, did not know any of the other girls who had received emails from Caulker before this whole situation.  As mentioned before, he would occasionally send “mass” emails and this is how she found out about the other women.
“A lot of the emails he had sent to me he sent to just me personally… but a good portion of them he included at least five or ten other girls,” she said. “Either girls he had talked to in the past, or girls who were friends of these girls who he sent multiple messages to.”
These “mass” emails allowed these girls to connect.  She said that because of them she started getting Facebook messages from the other girls that she had been grouped together in these emails with.
https://q30tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Audio_Answer_7.mp3
 
She said that this group of girls did not want any harm to be the outcome of them going to the Department of Public Safety.  All that she personally wanted was for Caulker to stop reaching out to her.
“He was reaching out to my home friends, my family, I just personally wanted him to stop that because he… just the things he was saying were almost… they were just… they just made it seem like we had a relationship or something like that it’s just almost embarrassing,” she said.
The main goal for her was to get Caulker to stop contacting people from her personal and she is optimistic that now it will end.
https://q30tv.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Audio_Answer_8.mp3
 
When the emails did “take a turn” she became very worried.
“Based on some of his the way he was talking and stuff I didn’t really know what he would do next. I didn’t think he was…he didn’t sound stable all the time so I definitely got worried,” she said.

This situation has been brought to the Hamden Police Department and is currently an open investigation.

DENVER — A 23-year-old metro Denver woman has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Regis University for the way she says it failed to handle her claim of sexual harassment.
The former graduate student and the 58-year-old professor she accuses of inappropriate behavior are not being named. The professor resigned last week, seven months after the woman first complained to university leaders, according to her Equal Employment Opportunity Commission complaint.
The student and her attorney Paula Greisen said they suspect Regis University forced the professor to step down but only after it was clear the university was going to be the target of legal action.
“If the professor not being a part of the university any longer was the correct action, I am surprised it did not happen in July,” the student said.
The student said she was one year into her graduate study program when things took an uncomfortable turn at an out-of-town hotel in June.
She said she and the professor, who was also her immediate supervisor, were attending a conference when he asked her to come to his hotel room before dinner one night.
“When I knocked on the door, he opened it wearing his boxers and a T-shirt. He invited me inside and continued to dress,” said the student, who added she felt very uncomfortable.
A month later on another out-of-town trip that the student felt wasn’t necessary for her to attend but did at the professor’s insistence, she said the professor, “Offered me a glass of wine and shared deep intimate personal feelings with me. Things such as ‘You are my soul mate and I love you and my wife both,’ which of course made me feel uncomfortable.”
When she returned to Denver, the student said she complained to human resources at Regis, and was told she and her professor would no longer share workspace or have to see each other, but they were still expected to work together using email.
“There were emails that would say, ‘I think we really need to have a phone conversation, there’s a lot that we need to go over,'” remembered the student, who said the “separation plan” wasn’t working and she was having anxiety attacks.
She finally chose to leave the university in November but not on terms she would’ve chosen.
“I was offered a sabbatical and that felt like a way to cover up the situation and gracefully ask me to exit,” she said.
“The university promptly and fully investigated the allegations and took immediate, appropriate, corrective action as specified in its nondiscrimination and sexual misconduct policy,” the university said in a statement. “The subject of this charge is no longer employed by the university.”
But a university email sent to students on Sunday announcing the professor’s resignation makes it clear the professor didn’t resign until late February.
“If that was the appropriate immediate action, then why wasn’t it done in time to save this young woman’s career?” Greisen said.
“The student is gone. They’ve tried to save face and we have a student who had an amazing career path that is now working at Starbucks.”
The 23-year-old former student said she never felt the university took her concerns seriously.
“At Regis as an undergrad and as a graduate student in all of my courses, we were taught to fight against injustice … to protect the victim and the hypocrisy that I felt from the university that I gave so much to is really painful,” she said.
The student’s EEOC complaint states the professor did not deny his conduct during a university mediation hearing.
Regis said in its statement that it’s confident the EEOC will reject the student’s complaint.

		HOLLY SPRINGS, Miss. — A former professor at Rust College entered a guilty plea to a charge of sexual battery Monday morning.
Sylvester Oliver was facing a trial after being indicted for raping a student in his office.
Oliver was given a 15 year suspended sentence.
He is also facing five years of supervised probation.
In February, we reported eight other women who have come forward to say they were also attacked.
“All of these women reported the behavior. They reported the assaults, and nothing was done in every last one of them,” said Sam Cherry a partner at the Cochran Law Firm.

https://theaggie.org/2018/06/07/former-uc-davis-professor-filmed-individuals-showering-without-their-consent-stored-footage-on-university-owned-hard-drives/,"KARL KJER / COURTESY (left), MIDDLESEX COUNTY PROSECUTORS OFFICE / COURTESY (right)
Accidental finding led to conviction of former UC Davis professor for filming of 19-year old
Before taking time off for Winter Break in 2015, Karl Kjer, an entomologist and tenured professor at UC Davis, left the keys to his office with one of the junior specialists working in his lab so they could feed his fish while he was gone. A few weeks prior to Winter Break, Kjer had asked the junior specialist to order two 1-terabyte Western Digital external hard drives, purchased through the university, for the purpose of storing photographs and images for research-related purposes.
The junior specialist, who recently recounted the incident to The California Aggie and who wishes to remain anonymous, said they had seen Kjer take the hard drives into his office — which had a separate door that locks independently. The plan was to transfer photos from an iMac to a computer hooked up to an imaging system. A volunteer working at the lab had asked the junior specialist to retrieve the hard drives from Kjer’s office so they could begin transferring files.
“I went to find the hard drives […] in Karl’s office and just picked up one and gave it to the volunteer and we plugged it into the iMac,” the junior specialist said. “And the hard drive’s window […] automatically pops up. We saw all of these different little file names pop up, and we were like, ‘What’s this?’ Because we weren’t expecting them to be full already.”
What they found on the hard drives was not the research data they expected, but internet pornography as well as videos Kjer had recorded himself in 2012 by setting up a camera inside the bathroom of his home in New Jersey to record individuals without their knowledge. The discovery of these materials on hard drives purchased by UC Davis later led to criminal charges.
Kjer recently spoke to The California Aggie over email about his time at UC Davis and his ultimate resignation from the university for health reasons.
“Working at UC Davis was the greatest honor of my life,” Kjer said. “My colleagues in my department were so kind to me, and were unaware that for a short period prior to moving to California, I was consumed by an ugly, compulsive and addictive behavior that I was unable to control. I commend those who shined a light on it, and in particular, one in NJ whose strength and bravery is beyond measure.  I never meant to harm anyone, and am sorry. I know I cannot undo the harm I caused. I deeply regret the impact of my actions on all those affected. I have been in therapy since, and am focusing on sobriety.”
________________
 
In July of 2015, Karl Kjer accepted the Schlinger Chair of Systematic Entomology position in the UC Davis Department of Entomology and Nematology. Kjer left Rutgers University, in New Jersey, after 18 years at the university, for the tenured position at UC Davis.
Kjer is a co-founder of the 1,000 Insect Transcription Evolution Project. According to the Davis Enterprise, the project’s team had “developed state-of-the-art methods to analyze genetic data from the DNA of modern insects and calibrate DNA ‘clocks’ with fossil records” which were then used “to estimate the patterns and timing of insect evolution.” 
Morgan Jackson, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, said via email interview that Kjer “was highly regarded for his work deciphering the higher relationships of insects using DNA data, which he was an early proponent of.” Jackson had cited “a number of papers” that Kjer had either published or contributed to. 
In November of 2015, Kjer hired a junior specialist who worked with him in a full-time position in his lab at UC Davis.

 “When I first started working with Kjer, we were going to set up a really nice imaging system for publications or just high-def microphotography [of] specimens we were going to use for his research,” the junior specialist said. “Since we did not get our imaging system first, we decided to kind of prepare for it, and so he [Kjer] asked me to order two hard drives.”
After opening files on just one of the two university-purchased hard drives stored in Kjer’s office over Winter Break, the junior specialist and volunteer found a lot of “terrible images that he recorded of quite a lot of women without them knowing.”
“There was a lot of folders of internet pornography that he downloaded, and we kind of closed the window and looked at each other like, ‘What did we just find?’” the junior specialist said. “At a later point, after we looked through it and made notes [of] when they were taken, when did he last access them — they were spanning at least all the way back from 2010, up to 2012, 2013. A lot of them said that he was still accessing them up to 2015, when I was working.”
In addition to the internet pornography stored on the hard drives, the junior specialist estimates that there were more than 10 videos Kjer had recorded himself, including a video of him installing the camera in the bathroom in his home in New Jersey. It appeared the camera was pointed at the shower and some individuals being filmed were partially clothed while others were nude — “all of them definitely did not know they were being filmed or imaged at the time.”
“We kind of freaked out a little bit and we weren’t sure what to do,” the junior specialist said. “Both of us were kind of scared the university wouldn’t take us seriously or wouldn’t take serious action against Karl. We were scared about that and we didn’t know if we would get retaliated against.” 
 The junior specialist continued working with Kjer until his resignation from the university, although they took a medical leave because they were “stressed and not coping too well with the entire situation.”
“I decided to talk to one of the professors at UC Davis who I really trusted,” the junior specialist said. ”She, through obligation, told me beforehand that she would have to tell the appropriate authorities at UC Davis if I was going to tell her. She reported it to the UC Davis police and they got involved and ended up confiscating the computers at Kjer’s lab, including the hard drives. The volunteer and I […] also took backups of the evidence that were on the hard drives on our own little USBs and we turned those in too. Only through the professor I talked to initially who I reported this to did I learn that he was encouraged to leave and that he himself decided to leave the university a week after this meeting.”
The university initially denied record requests from The California Aggie related to the incident, citing an exemption for disclosure in relation to personnel matters. However, the university did finally release a Summary of Incident Report.
“June 10, 2016: UC Davis Police Department was contacted by College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences (CAES) when student employees alleged that a tenured faculty professor had secretly videotaped possible students in a bathroom,” the report states. “June 13, 2016: UC Davis Detective met with student employees and two CAES administrators. Student employee discovered pornographic thumbnail images on hard drive. Student employees looked through some of the files and saw Kjer placing and removing a video camera in a bathroom after a female got out of the shower. Student employees copied and saved images and videos on a thumb drive but did not alert authorities until now. Detective reviewed videos and confirmed content.”
According to Sgt. Paul Henoch from the UC Davis Police Department, two concurrent investigations were occuring at this time — the university’s investigation and the criminal investigation, which he was involved with. The report states that the modification/creation dates on the videos are 8/21/2012 and 8/22/2012, before Kjer came to UC Davis. 
Henoch was responsible for determining whether any criminal violations took place in California. One of Kjer’s hard drives was seized, which Henoch said contained videos of surreptitious recordings of “women [and] possible students in [the] bathroom, taking a shower, getting out of the shower [and] undressing.”
According to the report, “Detective, with assistance of CAES administrators, was able to confirm probable identity of one of the females in the video.” Henoch said detectives confirmed the identity of one of the individuals using a still image of a posterboard of a project the student had been working on. The individual was not a UC Davis student. 
Ultimately, detectives “could not determine that any crime occurred in California.”  
On June 16, a letter was delivered to Kjer which placed him on administrative leave and UCDPD sent information to New Jersey.
“Once my investigation was completed, [the] university was very concerned about the safety of the students here, that’s why I went through all of the megabytes of imagery, videos and stuff like that,” Henoch said. “I was able to determine that none of it was our students or videotaped at UC Davis and it happened back in 2012-2014 over at possibly Rutgers University. I sent my incident report to Rutgers and they sent it to wherever they needed to send it.”
The California Aggie received a copy of The State of New Jersey vs. Karl M. Kjer, dated to 2017.
“Within the jurisdiction of this court, knowing he is not licensed or privileged to do so, he photographs, films, videotapes, records or otherwise reproduces in an [sic] manner, the image of another person whose intimate parts are exposed or who is engaged in an act of sexual penetration or sexual contact without that person’s consent and under circumstances in which a reasonable person would not expect to be observed, specifically by video taping (victim #1) while showering at his residence […in NJ] without her knowledge or consent, in violation  N.J.S. 2C: 14-9B (a third degree crime).”
Kjer was charged on Feb. 17, 2017 “with one count of invasion of privacy” for filming a 19-year old woman showering in his bathroom in June of 2015 without her knowledge, according to the website for Middlesex County, New Jersey. One article from a local New Jersey publication states that he has avoided jail time and was sentenced to three years probation.
“He would invited people over to his house for parties because sometimes that’s what lab professors do […] so they can connect and get along with each other,” the junior specialist said. “But he was just using it for a really malicious purpose.”
In email communication with The California Aggie, Kjer said both he and UC Davis administrators “came to an agreement of confidentiality” over his resignation in June of 2016 which “was health related.” 
After news broke in 2017 that Kjer had been charged in New Jersey, however, some students and staff in the Department of Entomology and Nematology were upset the university had not told them about the investigation. Some UC Davis students found out about the charges through tweets. One tweet from entomologist Fran Keller, who works at the UC Davis Bohart Museum, states: “Now we know why he left an entomology endowed systematics chair at UCD. He… secretly recording woman in shower.”
Other students found out about the charges from Jackson, the aforementioned Ph.D. candidate in Canada, who also tweeted about the news. 
“I’m sorry that the Davis entomology community learned about Kjer’s deeds via my Twitter rather than from their institution and “leadership,”” Jackson wrote via email interview. “For what it’s worth, I originally learned of the story from a Davis alum who shared the first news report from New Jersey and noted that this would explain why Kjer seemingly disappeared in the dead of night from a high profile research chair position.”
On March 2, 2017, Steve Nadler, the chair of the Department of Entomology  Nematology, sent an email to graduate students addressing the arrest of Kjer in New Jersey.
“I understand that this has been disturbing news to those of you who have become aware of this thing through social media,” Nadler wrote in the email. “Several of you have expressed concerns to me about what may have taken place while Karl was employed at UC Davis. Please be assured that I share your concerns about Dr. Kjer. it is my understanding that the University learned of this matter in June, 2016. The University acted immediately to launch a criminal investigation and placed Dr. Kjer on involuntary leave.”
Nadler also offered to organize “a joint student-faculty committee to address any remaining concerns you may have regarding student safety or graduate student-faculty interactions.” On March 9, Nadler sent another email. 
“I realize that one of the disturbing things about […] the Karl Kjer incident is that there is concern among those of you who visited Karl’s home that your privacy could have been violated,” Nadler wrote. “I also understand that this concern may persist despite that the UC Davis police found no evidence of criminal activity taking place in Davis based on university computers and backup drives seized from Dr. Kjer (and examined by the UCD police). I had a conversation about this with members of the Dean’s office today, and they recommend that if you have any reason to believe that you could have been a victim of Dr. Kjer, please contact the UC Davis police to discuss the matter with them.”
After Kjer’s departure from the university, his former junior specialist was able to work in Nadler’s lab for some time. The junior specialist said that while they did feel the university addressed the situation, they also felt “they were trying to sweep it under the rug.”
Entomologist Gwen Pearson, who is also Purdue University’s Department of Entomology Education and Outreach coordinator, is the founder and head of Ento-Allies, which serves as “victim advocates.” Pearson spoke to The California Aggie not as part of her official capacity as an official at Purdue.
“Entomology itself is an interesting discipline,” Pearson said. “For many, many years, women were quite scarce. At this point, we have almost equal male/female student numbers, but in terms of tenured members in entomology or people who are in the industry, there’s still a pretty significant skew towards men. We’re there for the people who have had bad things happen. Especially when you have power situations, like a faculty member and a student, not everybody wants to file a complaint but they do need support and advice and somebody to say, ‘It’s totally not your fault that you were picked on, it’s totally not your fault that someone touched you inappropriately, and we will stay with you and here’s some options for you.’”
Pearson discussed what she says is a pattern in the scientific community where a male professional will engage in inappropriate behavior, resign and quickly find another job.
“Right about the time they’re called on it, and proceedings begin, if they resign, it’s over because they’re no longer an employee and the university no longer has any sway over that,” Pearson said. “Very often what happens is […] someone will get in trouble and resign, start over at a new institution and their bad behavior doesn’t necessarily follow them from institution to institution.” 
An example of this pattern, which Pearson discussed, is that of the accusations of sexual misconduct as well as research misconduct aimed at University of Kentucky Professor of Entomology James Harwood, who subsequently resigned from his position. The university decided not to pursue an investigation after Harwood’s resignation.
“I’ve seen it happen a couple of times where someone resigns and back channel talk is all — they get caught doing something they shouldn’t have done — and they get a new job,” Pearson said. “It really baffles me why, when there’s such a huge pool of talented scientists, why do we keep rehiring people who we know behave badly?”
Jackson discussed his frustration when, after the news broke of Kjer’s criminal charges, colleagues “shrugged it off,” chastised him “for speaking out and condemning him before he was found guilty” or “who continued to publish with him.” 
“If academics are too afraid or too weak to call out someone who has been criminally convicted for exploiting multiple victims, how can we trust them to do the right thing when a case isn’t as black and white?” Jackson said. “How can we trust them to stand up for their students, their employees, or the general public interacting with their institution if they can’t bring it upon themselves to publicly comment and condemn someone like Kjer? I’m equally concerned about scientists who may choose to overlook these charges and still consider Kjer a scientist worth collaborating with, as if his ideas and influence excuse his exploitation of other humans.”

 For Pearson, in a circumstance such as this, it is important to make sure people are informed — “there’s things that we can do personally, which is what I’m focused on, by being as supportive as I can to victims.”

 “This is not someone you should collaborate with,” Pearson said. “The larger part is, the consensus we are moving towards, is that harassment, assault — that’s a type of misconduct that is scientific misconduct. If you can’t be a good human, then you can’t be a good scientist.”

http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2017/06/conviction_overturned_for_professor_accused_of_sex.html,"NEWARK - Former Rutgers-Newark professor Anna Stubblefield, who was accused of sexually assaulting a disabled man who was unable to speak, has had her convictions overturned after an appellate court determined she did not get a fair trial.The court ordered that Stubblefield get another trial overseen by a new judge.The decision was handed down Friday, overturning Stubblefield's two 2015 convictions for first-degree aggravated sexual assault. During the trial, the jury concluded that Stubblefield, then a 39-years-old philosophy professor, had sexually assaulted a then-29-year-old man known only as D.J. in 2011. The man had cerebral palsy and was unable to speak apart from making noises. Psychologists determined that D.J. couldn't consent to sex because he was mentally impaired.During the trial, Stubblefield's lawyers maintained that she and D.J. fell in love and that she was able to communicate with him through a typing method called ""facilitated communication.""Anna Stubblefield (FILE)Following the conviction, Stubblefield was sentenced to two consecutive 12-year terms in prison and lifetime parole supervision.Much of Stubblefield's case focused on the accuracy and reliability of the controversial typing method, ""facilitated communication,"" which the appellate court referred to as ""FC,"" in its decision. Before the trial, Superior Court Judge Siobhan Teare, who presided over the case, ruled that there could be no expert testimony on the reliability or technique of FC because it wasn't a ""recognized science.""Over the course of Stubblefield's 2015 trial, Essex County prosecutors presented three experts who all testified to D.J.'s mental incapacities. One expert, Dr. Howard Shane, who has a PhD in speech pathologies, testified that the man was not a candidate for augmentative communication devices because of his impaired mental state, the decision said.But Stubblefield's defense attorney had an expert witness too - Dr. Rosemary Crossley, an augmentative and alternative communication specialist from Austrialia who determined that D.J. could communicate and read, according to the decision.Crossley did an extensive, three-day videoed evaluation of D.J., which sought to determine his language and literacy skills and determine if he had, ""communicative intent,"" the decision said. She did use FC in her assessment but nothing that she used the device for factored into her overall assessment of D.J., the defense argued.However, her evaluation and videotape of the assessment were not brought into evidence  - they were deemed unreliable because she had used FC in her assessment, the court ruled.""The court believed Dr. Crossley's reports and examinations are inadmissible because her communication assessment is based upon an unrecognized field of science known as facilitated communication, rendering Dr. Crossley not an expert and her opinion inadmissible as a net opinion,"" the decision said in an overview of the facts of the case.In the decision, the appellate court sided with Stubblefield's defense attorneys, who claimed that by preventing Crossley from presenting her full evaluation of D.J., the court was preventing the defense attorneys from presenting their full argument.""The jury and not the court should have ultimately determined whether Dr. Crossley's evaluation was persuasive, and whether the state proved defendant knew or should have known that D.J. could not consent,"" the appellate court ruled.Because they couldn't hear Crossley's full assessment, the jury was left with the impression that no expert or other person - apart from Stubblefield herself - believed that D.J. had the mental abilities to consent to sex, the decision said.""Unfortunately, the court, in its attempt to cleanse the record of controversial FC methodology, limited the evidence to the extent that defendant was not given a fair opportunity to present her defense,"" the appellate court ruled.The court went on to call the facts of the case ""extraordinary,"" and that they called for ""a liberal admission of evidence supporting defendant's defense.""The appellate court called for a new judge who would allow Crossley to testify regarding her evaluation and who would admit at least parts of her video evaluation into evidence for the jury to view.Stubblefield's case became a national story after her 2011 charges but the interactions date back almost ten years.She first met D.J. through his brother, who was a student in her class, in 2008.Stubblefield, then a department chair at Rutgers University, showed a film to her class regarding FC. The film prompted D.J.'s brother to approach his professor and ask for help for his brother. D.J. could not speak words, wore a diaper and needed help in day-to-day living, according to statement of facts in the decision.The professor began to have meetings with D.J. in 2009 - at first with his parents and then alone in her office.""(Stubblefield) became convinced that D.J. had been misdiagnosed as having the intellectual ability of a young child,"" the decision said.In May 2011, Stubblefield told D.J.'s parents that she had sexual contact with their son and that they were in love, according to the decision. She then kissed D.J. in front of his parents.D.J.'s parents questioned whether he was capable of consent and tested him with questions only he would know, according to the decision. When they believed he answered the questions incorrectly, they told Stubblefield to stop having contact with their son and called Rutgers University with a complaint.The university reached out to the Essex County Prosecutor's Office who, after an investigation, charged and indicted Stubblefield on two counts of aggravated sexual assault.Stubblefield has never denied having sexual contact with D.J. but she has argued that he was mentally competent enough to consent to their interactions.Anna Merriman may be reached at amerriman@njadvancemedia.com.

Sexual harassment occurs is more places than just the workplace. Take this case of a  Sacramento State college professor accused of sexually harassing four students and three professors. The battle started in 2005 and 2006 when four female students told other professors in the language department that Corral took them to dinner, made sexual comments or hugged and kissed them.
After being accused of sexual harassment, Spanish professor Wilfrido Corral was fired from the university. He challenged the termination and continued teaching during the lengthy appeals process.
Corral sued Sacramento State the same year, alleging that it botched its investigation and discriminated against him for being Latino. He challenged the termination and continued teaching during the lengthy appeals process. Corral sued Sacramento State the same year, alleging that it botched its investigation and discriminated against him for being Latino.
But now Mr. Corral has dropped his lawsuit against the university and resigned. He agreed to stop teaching and California State University agreed not to pursue him for defense costs, according to a settlement the parties signed in July. No money was exchanged in the settlement, but the university has had to pay more than $900,000 to settle claims from some of the women who said Corral harassed them.
You can see the chaos that can erupt from a case of sexual harassment. Not only does it cost money, but costs jobs and affects people personally. A lot of this could maybe have been mitigated through a program of sexual harassment training at the university. No comments were made of the training that is in place now, but certainly the administrators are going to take a close look to see what can be done to make improvements.

A federal retaliation lawsuit filed by Director of Engineering Career Services Cici Mattiuzzi against Sacramento State and Engineering and Computer Sciences Dean Emir Macari reached a settlement Jan. 16 which includes the dismissal of all evidence.
The case, which included three days of testimony from Mattiuzzi and her husband Paul, was settled after Sacramento State agreed not to pursue filing, deposition and other standard litigation fees if the jury had found in the university’s favor.
“The University considers this result a complete victory in its favor,” said attorney David Tyra. “Throughout the litigation, the University had a high degree of confidence in its defense. Post-trial interviews with the jurors who heard the plaintiff’s case during the first three days of the trial revealed that the University’s confidence in its position was well-founded. Many of those jurors – without having heard a single witness from the University – felt the evidence weighed in the University’s favor.”
After filing a lawsuit in 2009, Mattiuzzi claimed the university retaliated against her and was subjected to discriminating actions, including exclusion from key career services meetings and removal of departmental funds.
According to a trial brief filed by Sacramento State, which was represented by the California State University Board of Trustees, the plaintiff’s claims were “meritless” and are based on “ginned-up overreactions to innocent, non-retaliatory measures.”
In 2009, Mattiuzzi filed a whistleblower lawsuit against former Sac State engineering professor Miroslav Markovic, who allegedly sexually harassed students and once threatened to shoot several employees.
Markovic retired shortly after the case was filed, and the lawsuit was settled in 2010.
When Mattiuzzi returned to work after taking a medical leave, she claimed she was immediately subject to “adverse action” by Macari.
According to the trial brief, Sacramento State allowed Markovic to visit the campus to have his personal laptop repaired, and Mattiuzzi alleged the campus refused to shield her from Markovic.
Mattiuzzi also claimed she was excluded from the 2010 Workforce Summit Meeting, an event established by her to discuss solutions to the shortage of engineers in the community. She said she was not able to plan, organize, attend or participate in the event.
According to the trial brief, Mattiuzzi was excluded because the meeting was held during spring break, a time in which Mattiuzzi did not work.
Mattiuzzi also alleged Macari removed funds improperly from her career services account, a fund she uses for events, supplies, equipment and services. An alleged $130,000 was taken without her consent, according to court documents.
The university said the withdrawal was used in “an unprecedented fiscal crisis that required the utilization of all funds.”
Mattiuzzi’s attorney Stephen Mason said the case was very expensive to litigate and included over $100,000 in attorney fees.
He said Mattiuzzi accomplished her main goal, which was to notify the public of what was really occurring at Sac State. Her story, which includes 35 years of wrongdoing, is now public record.
Mason also noted how there has been an “unusually high number of claims” of sexual harassment and retaliation by tenured employees, and includes a recent lawsuit filed by University Advancement employee Jeffrey Sharp against Alexander Gonzalez Jr., the son of President Alexander Gonzalez.
According to the California Whistleblower Protection Act, employees cannot be retaliated against or prevented from disclosing potential violations of state and government law.
According to Mattiuzzi’s trial brief, there was a causal link between the Markovic lawsuit and the proximity in time between the protected action and the alleged retaliatory actions.
The case was first filed in federal court in May 2011, but after Macari filed for bankruptcy in October 2012, he was dismissed from the case in February 2013. While he would have served as a primary witness in the case, he remains on a leave of absence from Sac State for unknown reasons.

				In August, a Salisbury University panel concluded an investigation and found that physics professor Asif Shakur violated the school’s sexual harassment policy by inappropriately touching a student’s breasts and buttocks.
According to The Daily Times:
As a result of its findings, the Fair Practices Panel recommended Shakur be sanctioned in addition to receiving a written reprimand and suspension without pay during the fall 2010 semester.
The panel suggested the professor receive counseling to better educate himself on sexual harassment and appropriate student-teacher relationships and recommended he not be allowed to return to his position until he can provide documentation that he completed the counseling.
In May, a second female student filed a complaint against Shakur alleging he had rubbed his genitals against her while she completed an assignment in October 2009, according to the Fair Practices Panel investigative report.
The university panel decision came four months after a Wicomico County Circuit Court jury found Shakur not guilty of sex offense after a two-day trial April 29.

Syrian-born adjunct instructor loses discrimination suit against Utah College.

 A Syrian-born adjunct faculty member has lost a lawsuit accusing
Salt Lake Community College of discrimination based on his race,
religion and Middle Eastern origin.

 Jihad Al-Ali, an adjunct mathematics and computer instructor, found
himself dismissed by the college just six days into the 2001 spring
semester following a ""verbal altercation"" with a student.

 That incident, combined with multiple student complaints of sexual
harassment and ""an abnormally high withdrawal rate"" of
students from his classes led the college to reject Al-Ali's
further teaching requests, U.S. District Judge David Sam explained in
his decision.

 Al-Ali had taught at the college for two years before his
dismissal. He applied unsuccessfully to get re-hired until 2003, when he
lodged formal civil rights complaints with the college and then the
state.

 According to Al-Ali's discrimination and wrongful discharge suit, several college employees ""treated him differently than they
would other white employees,"" and ""it became well established
that these employees did not want him to work there any longer.""

 He sought back pay, compensation for emotional distress and damage
to reputation, reinstatement and punitive damages.

 The suit asserted that ""it cannot be for any other reason but
for racial animus, because his performance record while at SLCC has been
exemplary.""

 He also claimed that employees ""routinely and regularly""
lied to him in an effort to convince him that they were raking his
discrimination complaints seriously.

 The college disputed Al-Ali's claim that his performance
record was ""exemplary."" In addition to the high withdrawal
rate of his students, it cited two allegations of sexual harassment in
two years.

 The first came in 1999 according to the court decision. Then in
June 2001. two female students complained that Al-Ali had harassed them
over the phone.

 Al-Ali's lawsuit faced several challenges, including the fact
that his teaching contracts were on a semester basis, with no guarantees
of future employment.

 On the civil rights claims, Sam found no direct evidence of
discrimination or that other employees were treated differently.
""Contrary to Mr. Al-Ali's assertions, SLCC has set forth
legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions,"" the judge
wrote.

 The other major problem was that he didn't file his complaint
until two years after his dismissal, well past the statute of
limitations. Sam rejected the excuse that Al-Ali waited so long because
he hadn't realized he'd been permanently fired until 2003,
when the college asked for his keys.

 At the time of dismissal, the department chair allegedly told
Al-Ali he ""needed some time away"" but never explained that lie
wouldn't be permitted to teach future courses, Al-Ali claimed,
adding that the chair had assured him several times he'd receive a
teaching assignment the next semester.

 But the chair denied making any such commitment, adding that
""neither I, nor the adjunct faculty coordinators at SLCC wanted Mr.
Al-Ali teaching classes because of his previous conduct, i.e. harassing
students, making religious comments and the altercation that led to his
termination.""

 The chair said he wrote a recommendation letter to help Al-Ali find
alternative employment but that the letter wasn't a new contract
with the college.

 In his decision, Sam noted that Al-Ali applied for unemployment
insurance benefits only a few months after termination. ""There was
simply no basis for him to conclude that Iris employment had not come to
an end, for whatever reason, or that somehow he remained employed""
by the college.

 Assistant Attorney Gen. Richard Bissell, said Al-Ali has filed an
appeal. Al-Ali represented himself in the case.

 CLAIMS IN CONFLICT

 The college disputed the claim that Al-Ali's performance
record was exemplary, citing a high withdrawal rate of his students and
two allegations of sexual harassment in two years.

883 F. Supp. 1407 (1995)
Dean COHEN, Plaintiff,
v.
SAN BERNARDINO VALLEY COLLEGE et al., Defendants.
No. CV-94-1083-RSWL-GHKx.
United States District Court, C.D. California.
April 14, 1995.
*1408 *1409 Rohde  Victoroff, Stephen F. Rohde and John W. Howard, Individual Rights Foundation, Los Angeles, CA, for plaintiff.
Phillip L. Kossy, Littler Mendelson Fastiff Tichy  Mathiason, San Diego, CA, and Amy Greyson, Brunick Alvarez  Battersby, San Bernardino, CA, for defendants. 
OPINION
LEW, District Judge.
Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(a), the parties in this case have stipulated to a bench trial in this matter based solely on a stipulated record and written briefs. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1343, and 1367.
Plaintiff Dean Cohen (""Cohen"") brings a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action for violation of his First Amendment rights. He asks the Court to grant injunctive relief against various officials of San Bernardino Valley College (Defendants are hereinafter collectively referred to as ""the College""). This action presents the question of whether a state college may limit the classroom speech of its professors in order to prevent the creation of a hostile, sexually discriminatory environment for its students. The Court hereby rules that a state college may do so, if the limitations involved are reasonable and narrowly *1410 tailored to achieve the college's mission of effectively educating its students. Plaintiff therefore receives no relief in this action. 
I. Facts[1]
The following facts are uncontroverted. Cohen is a tenured professor who has taught English and Film Studies at San Bernardino Valley College (""SBVC"") since 1968. In the spring of 1992, Cohen taught a remedial English class (English 015) to community college students. Students are required to take English 015 as a prerequisite to other college-level English classes such as English 101. This matter arises out of discipline imposed on Cohen for his teaching in a 015 class in the spring semester of 1992.
By his own admission, Cohen uses a confrontational teaching style designed to shock his students and make them think and write about controversial subjects. He assigns provocative essays such as Jonathan Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" and discusses subjects such as obscenity, cannibalism, and consensual sex with children.[2] At times, Cohen uses vulgarities and profanity in the classroom.
One of the students in the spring semester English 015 class, Anita Murillo, became offended by Cohen's repeated focus on topics of a sexual nature, his use of profanity and vulgarities, and by his comments which she believed were directed intentionally at her and some other female students in a humiliating and harassing manner. In February of 1992, Cohen began a class discussion in his English 015 class on the issue of pornography and played the ""devil's advocate"" by asserting controversial viewpoints. During classroom discussion on this subject, Cohen stated in class that he wrote for Hustler and Playboy, and he read some articles out loud in class.[3] Cohen concluded the class discussion by requiring his students to write essays defining pornography. When Cohen assigned the ""Define Pornography"" paper, Murillo asked for an alternative assignment but Cohen refused to give her one.
According to Murillo, Professor Cohen then told her that if she met him in a bar he would help her get a better grade. She also claimed that Cohen would look down her shirt, as well as the shirts of other female students, and that he told her she was over-reacting because she was a woman.
Murillo stopped attending Cohen's class and received a failing grade for the semester. She subsequently complained about Cohen's statements and conduct to the chair of the English Department, asserting that Cohen had sexually harassed her. Murillo then filed a formal written student grievance against Cohen on May 12, 1993.
On May 26, 1993, the SBVC Faculty Grievance Committee held a hearing to determine whether Murillo's complaint was well-founded. Both Cohen and Murillo testified, submitted documents, and called witnesses on their own behalf. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Grievance Committee found that Professor Cohen had violated the Community College District's policy against sexual harassment by creating a hostile learning environment.[4] The Grievance Committee *1411 then recommended certain disciplinary action to the President of the District.
The President of the District then issued a ruling which found Cohen in violation of the District's policy against sexual harassment. Among other things, the President found that Cohen engaged in ""sexual harassment which had the effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment."" In addition, the President found that Cohen made ""sexually suggestive"" remarks to Murillo and that several students were offended by Professor Cohen's use of profanity and frequent use of sexual topics in class.
Both Cohen and Murillo appealed the President and Grievance Committee's decision to the San Bernardino Community College Board of Trustees (""Board"") which considered the matter at hearings on October 15, 1993 and November 11, 1993. Cohen and Murillo were represented by attorneys and each of them testified on their own behalf. In addition, students came forward to testify about the sexual nature of Cohen's teaching material and his frequent use of derogatory language, sexual innuendo, and profanity.
On November 17, 1993, the Board found that Cohen engaged in sexual harassment which unreasonably interfered with an individual's academic performance and created an intimidating, hostile, or offensive learning environment. The Board then ordered Cohen to: 1. Provide a syllabus concerning his teaching style, purpose, content, and method to his students at the beginning of class and to the department chair by certain deadlines; 2. Attend a sexual harassment seminar within ninety days; 3. Undergo a formal evaluation procedure in accordance with the collective bargaining agreement; and 4. Become sensitive to the particular needs and backgrounds of his students, and to modify his teaching strategy when it becomes apparent that his techniques create a climate which impedes the students' ability to learn.
Thereafter, on February 18, 1994, Cohen filed a suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the San Bernardino Valley College Board of Trustees, the Chancellor of SBVC, the President of SBVC, various SBVC department heads, and members of the Faculty Grievance Committee. The complaint sought a declaratory judgment, a preliminary and permanent injunction, damages, and attorneys' fees. On April 4, 1994, this Court denied Cohen's motion for a preliminary injunction, on the grounds that Cohen failed to show a likelihood of success on the merits. On July 18, 1994 this Court also dismissed entity defendants San Bernardino Valley College, the Board of Trustees of San Bernardino Community College District, and the Faculty Grievance Committee, on the grounds that the entity defendants enjoy Eleventh Amendment immunity and are not considered ""persons"" under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.[5] On October 31, 1994, the Court ruled that the individual defendants are entitled to qualified immunity from damages under § 1983. 
II. The SBVC Policy As Applied to Cohen Does Not Violate the First Amendment

The heart of this suit is Cohen's assertion that the College's sexual harassment policy violates the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, § 2(a) of the California Constitution.[6] Cohen's *1412 position implicates the current debate concerning the need to make workplaces and schools places of inclusion, and the need to preserve individual liberties.[7] 
A. Academic Freedom Doctrine

Cohen argues that his right to ""academic freedom"" prevents the College from punishing him for his classroom speech. In support of his argument, Cohen cites numerous cases. The concept of academic freedom, however, is more clearly established in academic literature than it is in the courts. See generally Symposium, Academic Freedom in a Changing Society, 66 Texas L.Rev. 1247 (1988). As one commentator has written, The First Amendment protects academic freedom. This simple proposition stands explicit or implicit in numerous judicial opinions, often proclaimed in fervid rhetoric. Attempts to understand the scope and foundation of a constitutional guarantee of academic freedom, however, generally result in paradox or confusion. The cases, shorn of panegyrics, are inconclusive, the promise of their rhetoric reproached by the ambiguous realities of academic life. The problems are fundamental: There has been no adequate analysis of what academic freedom the Constitution protects or of why it protects it. Lacking definition or guiding principle, the doctrine floats in the law, picking up decisions as a hull does barnacles.
J. Peter Byrne, Academic Freedom: A ""Special Concern of the First Amendment"", 99 Yale L.J. 251, 252-53 (1989).
Several courts have noted that judicial application of this doctrine is far from clear. Hillis v. Stephen F. Austin State Univ., 665 F.2d 547, 552-53 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1106, 102 S. Ct. 2906, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1315 (1982); Mahoney v. Hankin, 593 F. Supp. 1171, 1174 (S.D.N.Y.1984) (stating that the parameters of academic freedom ""are not well-defined, especially with regard to a teacher's speech within the [college] classroom"").
While Supreme Court cases contain strongly worded defenses of ""academic freedom,"" their rhetoric is broader than their holdings. Namely, many cases restrict the government from regulating teachers' non-classroom conduct. For example, teachers like other government employees cannot be punished or excluded under unconstitutional statutes requiring them to take ""loyalty oaths"" or otherwise disclose their allegiance to ""subversive"" groups. Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 77 S. Ct. 1203, 1 L. Ed. 2d 1311 (1957); Wieman v. Updegraff, 344 U.S. 183, 73 S. Ct. 215, 97 L. Ed. 216 (1952). Nor may teachers be punished under unconstitutionally vague statutes forbidding ""treasonable"" or ""seditious"" words or actions. Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 87 S. Ct. 675, 17 L. Ed. 2d 629 (1967). The state is also precluded from punishing a teacher for publicly expressing his views on matters of public concern in regards to education. Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1968) (holding unconstitutional a school board's firing of a high school teacher for writing a letter to a local newspaper criticizing the school board); see discussion § II B. infra.
Most of the appellate cases cited by Cohen deal, like Pickering, with non-classroom conduct. Powell v. Gallentine, 992 F.2d 1088 (10th Cir. 1993) (holding professor's revelation of grade fraud protected as a matter of public concern); Levin v. Harleston, 966 F.2d 85, 88-89 (2d Cir.1992) (finding that professor could not be penalized for non-classroom, controversial writings); Greminger v. Seaborne, 584 F.2d 275, 277 (8th Cir. 1978) (finding that public comment on educational *1413 funding and salaries was protected by the First Amendment). Other cited cases do not rest on First Amendment grounds. See, e.g., Mailloux v. Kiley, 448 F.2d 1242, 1243 (1st Cir.1971) (per curiam) (affirming on Due Process grounds judgment for high school teacher who used an obscenity in English class).
Cohen cites only two Supreme Court cases which deal with regulation of teachers' classroom conduct, and these cases are based on the Establishment Clause, not on freedom of expression. Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 596-97, 107 S. Ct. 2573, 2584, 96 L. Ed. 2d 510 (1987) (striking down state law requiring teachers who taught ""evolution-science"" to also teach ""creation-science,"" on the grounds that the law endorsed religion in violation of the First Amendment); Epperson v. Arkansas, 393 U.S. 97, 103-04, 89 S. Ct. 266, 270, 21 L. Ed. 2d 228 (1968) (striking down state law prohibiting teaching of evolution, on the grounds that the government should be ""neutral"" in regards to religious tenets).
In further support of his ""academic freedom"" argument, Cohen cites cases dealing with the constitutional rights of students within the school environment. Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 187-88, 92 S. Ct. 2338-49, 33 L. Ed. 2d 266 (1972) (upholding associational right of college students forming a SDS chapter to be formally recognized by the university and be accorded the same access to campus facilities as other college clubs); Tinker v. Des Moines Sch. Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-06, 89 S. Ct. 733, 736, 21 L. Ed. 2d 731 (1969) (upholding freedom to expression right of high school students to wear black armbands to school, in protest of the Vietnam War). Again, these cases do not directly control the facts of this case.
Moreover, recent Supreme Court cases have narrowed the scope previously accorded to students' exercise of their constitutional rights within the high school setting. In Hazelwood Sch. Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, the Court allowed a high school principal to censor the school newspaper, because the censorship ""reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns."" 484 U.S. 260, 273, 108 S. Ct. 562, 571, 98 L. Ed. 2d 592 (1988). In so ruling, the Supreme Court stated that, while students do not shed their rights at the schoolhouse door, students' freedom of expression is ""`not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings.'"" Hazelwood, 484 U.S.  at 267, 108 S. Ct.  at 567 (quoting Bethel Sch. Dist. No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 682, 106 S. Ct. 3159, 3164, 92 L. Ed. 2d 549 (1986)). This was a restriction of Tinker, which primarily focused on whether the expression at issue presented the possibility of materially and substantially disrupting the educational process. Tinker, 393 U.S.  at 512-13, 89 S. Ct.  at 740. The Hazelwood Court stressed that high schools are allowed broad control over their curriculum. Hazelwood, 484 U.S.  at 271, 108 S. Ct.  at 570. In Bethel, the Court likewise found that high schools could restrict speech which undermined the school's ""basic educational mission."" 478 U.S.  at 686, 106 S. Ct.  at 3165. In that case, the high school punished a student for giving a speech full of sexual innuendo at a school-sponsored assembly. Id. at 675, 106 S. Ct.  at 3160. The Bethel Court found this punishment permissible, in light of the school's interest in ""teaching students the boundaries of socially appropriate behavior."" Id. at 681, 106 S. Ct.  at 3163.[8]
A number of circuits have found similar broad university control over curriculum. The First Circuit has held that a university has substantial control over such core university concerns as ""course content, homework load, and grading policy."" Lovelace v. Southeastern Massachusetts University, 793 F.2d 419, 424 (1st Cir.1986). The Lovelace court held that a university may decline to renew a nontenured teacher's employment on the grounds that his grading policy failed to comply with university standards. Id. In so holding, the Lovelace court refused to find that the teacher's grading policy was constitutionally protected, stating that ""[t]he first *1414 amendment does not require that each nontenured professor be made a sovereign unto himself."" Id.
Other courts have likewise found substantial university control over grading policies and teaching methods. Peloza v. Capistrano Unified School Dist., 782 F. Supp. 1412, 1416 (C.D.Cal.1992) (holding that a high school biology teacher has no ""constitutional right to conduct himself as a loose cannon in his classroom ... and teach scientific theories of his own choosing""), aff'd in part and rev'd in part on other grounds, 37 F.3d 517 (9th Cir.1994); Hillis v. Stephen F. Austin State Univ., 665 F.2d 547, 552 (5th Cir.) (holding nontenured teacher could be terminated for refusing to give an unearned grade to a student), cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1106, 102 S. Ct. 2906, 73 L. Ed. 2d 1315 (1982); Hetrick v. Martin, 480 F.2d 705, 708-09 (6th Cir.) (upholding university's decision to decline to renew a nontenured teacher because of her pedagogical methods; the pedagogical methods at issue included stating, in the classroom, ""I am an unwed mother""), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 1075, 94 S. Ct. 592, 38 L. Ed. 2d 482 (1973); Clark v. Holmes, 474 F.2d 928, 931-32 (7th Cir.1972) (upholding university's decision to decline to renew a nontenured teacher because of the teacher's refusal to conform to university-required course content and teaching approach), cert. denied, 411 U.S. 972, 93 S. Ct. 2148, 36 L. Ed. 2d 695 (1973).
Other courts, however, have placed limits on the state's control of classroom discussion. Keefe v. Geanakos, 418 F.2d 359, 362 (1st Cir.1969) (finding that a high school teacher's classroom use of an obscenity for demonstrated educational purpose was protected); Dube v. State Univ., 900 F.2d 587, 598 (2d Cir.1990) (denying qualified immunity to defendants on the grounds that a professor's classroom discussion of controversial topics was protected by the First Amendment), cert. denied, 501 U.S. 1211, 111 S. Ct. 2814, 115 L. Ed. 2d 986 (1991); Parducci v. Rutland, 316 F. Supp. 352, 356 (M.D.Ala.1970) (holding that a high school English teacher could not be penalized for assigning a Kurt Vonnegut short story which was not inappropriate or disruptive).
Thus, a review of the case law shows that, despite eloquent rhetoric on ""academic freedom,"" the courts have declined to cede all classroom control to teachers. The parameters of academic freedom are not distinct, particularly in relation to the potential conflict with a university's duty to ensure adequate education of its students. What is clear, however, is that invocation of the ""academic freedom"" doctrine does not adequately address the complex issues presented by this case. For that reason, this Court declines to hold that SBVC's discipline of Cohen is precluded by general notions of academic freedom under the First Amendment. 
B. The Government as Employer Cases
Because the doctrine of academic freedom does not clearly protect Cohen's classroom, curriculum-based speech, the Court now turns to the line of cases dealing with the government's ability to regulate its employees' speech. The Supreme Court has acknowledged the conflict inherent in public employers' restriction of employee speech. In Connick v. Myers, the Supreme Court confirmed the government's right as an employer to restrict employee speech, unless that speech pertains to matters of ""public concern."" 461 U.S. 138, 142, 103 S. Ct. 1684, 1687, 75 L. Ed. 2d 708 (1983) (citing Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1968)), as the root of this doctrine). Connick discussed the discharge of a Louisiana assistant district attorney. The assistant district attorney was terminated for her workplace distribution of a ""questionnaire"" on office policies and morale which essentially asked for a ""vote of no-confidence"" in office supervisors. She argued that, inasmuch as the questionnaire dealt with the workings of a governmental agency, it was speech on a matter of public concern and therefore protected. The Connick Court disagreed, finding that the survey was designed to support the assistant district attorney's own personal battle with her superiors over a proposed transfer, not to objectively evaluate or comment on the workings of the district attorneys' office. 461 U.S.  at 147-48, 103 S. Ct.  at 1690.
*1415 Under Connick, this Court must first determine whether Cohen's speech can be characterized as ""constituting speech on a matter of public concern."" 461 U.S.  at 146, 103 S. Ct.  at 1690. If it can be so characterized, then the Defendants must show that the speech ""substantially interfered"" with government duties. 461 U.S.  at 149-50, 103 S. Ct.  at 1691. If it is not speech on a matter of public concern, then the government is entitled to ""wide latitude in managing [its employees], without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment,"" and this Court may not interfere in such managerial decisionmaking. 461 U.S.  at 146, 103 S. Ct.  at 1690.
Waters v. Churchill further elaborated on this approach to governmental restriction of employees' speech. ___ U.S. ___, 114 S. Ct. 1878, 128 L. Ed. 2d 686 (1994) (plurality opinion). In that case, a nurse employed at a state-run hospital was terminated for criticizing departmental policies to a potential department employee. Id. In ruling that the termination did not violate the nurse's First Amendment rights, Justice O'Connor wrote for the four-Justice plurality: To be protected, the [government employee's] speech must be on a matter of public concern, and the employee's interest in expressing herself on this matter must not be outweighed by any injury the speech could cause to ""`the interest of the State, as an employer in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.'""
Id. at ___, 114 S. Ct.  at 1884 (quoting Connick, 461 U.S.  at 142, 103 S.Ct. at 1687). Waters expressly states that ""constitutional review of government employment decisions must rest on different principles than review of speech restraints imposed by the government as sovereign."" Id. at ___, 114 S. Ct.  at 1887. The government as employer has far broader powers to restrict its employees' speech than does the government as sovereign. Id. at ___, 114 S. Ct.  at 1886. This broad power is based on the government's interest in efficiently carrying out its mission. Id. at ___-___, 114 S. Ct.  at 1887-88.
The Supreme Court recently affirmed this approach in United States v. National Treasury Employees Union, when it struck down a federal law prohibiting federal executive branch employees from receiving compensation for speeches or articles. ___ U.S. ___, ___, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1008, 130 L. Ed. 2d 964 (1995). In so holding, the Court found that the prohibited speech involved matters of public concern. Id. at ___, 115 S. Ct.  at 1013. The Court further found that the government's argument that regulation was necessary to prevent workplace disruption was speculative and did not justify the burden imposed on expressive activities. Id. at ___, 115 S. Ct.  at 1015.
The Connick approach has been applied within an educational context. The Pickering Court acknowledged that, it cannot be gainsaid that the State has interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general. The problem in any case is to arrive at a balance between the interests of the teacher, as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees.
Pickering, 391 U.S.  at 568, 88 S. Ct.  at 1734-35. The Ninth Circuit has previously employed a Pickering balancing-type test to a high-school journalism teacher's freedom of expression rights. Nicholson v. Board of Educ., 682 F.2d 858, 865 (9th Cir.1982). In Nicholson, a journalism teacher was terminated after, contrary to the principal's instructions, he encouraged the publication of controversial articles in the high school paper and failed to submit sensitive articles to school administrators before publication. Id. The Nicholson court found that the school had an interest in school discipline, loyalty, and harmony among co-workers, and that therefore, the teacher's termination did not violate the First Amendment. Id.
In this case, the record is undisputed as to what speech is at issue. This speech falls into two categories: (1) Cohen's use of vulgarities and obscenities in the classroom; and (2) Cohen's curricular focus on sexual *1416 topics such as pornography, as well as his classroom comments on sexual subjects. 
1. Speech on a Matter of Public Concern

Cohen's profanity is not speech on a matter of public concern. Yniguez v. Arizonans for Official English, 42 F.3d 1217, 1235 n. 20 (9th Cir.1994) (citing Waters) (dictum) (""[T]he government would have an indisputable right to prohibit its employees from using profanity or abusive language....""); see Waters, ___ U.S. at ___, 114 S. Ct.  at 1886 (""[W]e have never expressed doubt that a government employer may bar its employees from using Mr. Cohen's offensive utterance to members of the public, or to the people with whom they work.""). The Fifth Circuit has squarely held that a college instructor's habitual classroom use of profanity is not speech on a matter of public concern. Martin v. Parrish, 805 F.2d 583, 585 (5th Cir. 1986); see Dambrot v. Central Michigan Univ., 839 F. Supp. 477, 488 (E.D.Mich.1993) (finding that university basketball coach's use of a racial epithet during team pep-talk was not speech on a matter of public concern). Thus, Cohen's use of profanity is not protected speech under Connick, and it may be regulated by the College.
However, it is less clear whether Cohen's comments on pornography and other sexual topics constitute speech on a matter of public concern. The determination of whether an employee's speech is a matter of public concern is often a difficult one, for which there are few bright-line tests. See generally Stephen Allred, From Connick to Confusion: The Struggle to Define Speech on Matters of Public Concern, 64 Ind.L.J. 43 (1988); D. Gordon Smith, Comment, Beyond ""Public Concern"": New Free Speech Standards for Public Employees, 57 U.Chi.L.Rev. 249 (1990).
A public employee's speech is constitutionally protected if it may be fairly considered to relate to ""any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community."" Connick, 461 U.S.  at 146, 103 S. Ct.  at 1690. In determining whether an employee's speech addresses a matter of public concern, the Court must look at the ""`content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record.'"" Rankin v. McPherson, 483 U.S. 378, 384-85, 107 S. Ct. 2891, 2897, 97 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1987) (quoting Connick, 461 U.S.  at 147-48, 103 S.Ct. at 1690) (finding a state employee's comment on the attempted assassination of President Ronald Reagan that she hoped the next attempt would succeed was speech on a matter of public concern). This determination is made as a matter of law. Allen v. Scribner, 812 F.2d 426, 430 n. 8 (9th Cir.), amended, 828 F.2d 1445 (9th Cir.1987). Content is the most important factor in this analysis. Johnson v. Multnomah County, 48 F.3d 420, 424-25 (9th Cir. Feb. 16, 1995). Moreover, ""[t]he inappropriate or controversial character of a statement is irrelevant to the question of whether it deals with a matter of public concern."" Rankin, 483 U.S.  at 387, 107 S. Ct.  at 2898.
Many cases address this ""matter of public concern"" issue within the context of an employee's criticism of government conduct. In Gillette v. Delmore, the Ninth Circuit found that a fireman's criticism of fire department action, during the action in question, involved a matter of public concern. 886 F.2d 1194, 1197 (9th Cir.1989). The Gillette Court wrote that the fireman's speech ""concerned the manner in which police and fire fighters performed their duties on a particular occasion,"" and thus was entitled to constitutional protection. Id. at 1197; see Hyland v. Wonder, 972 F.2d 1129, 1139 (9th Cir.1992) (holding that juvenile hall volunteer could not be penalized for sending memorandum critical of juvenile hall management to judges and the governing agencies), cert. denied, ___ U.S. ___, 113 S. Ct. 2337, 124 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1993); Burgess v. Pierce County, 918 F.2d 104, 106 (9th Cir.1990) (per curiam) (holding that fire marshall's opposition to county ordinance was protected speech on a matter of public concern); Allen v. Scribner, 812 F.2d 426, 431 (9th Cir.), amended, 828 F.2d 1445 (9th Cir.1987) (holding that state entomologist's public criticism of state's medfly infestation project was speech on a matter of public concern).
In those cases, the courts focused on determining whether the statements at issue were protected speech on government conduct or unprotected speech dealing with the *1417 ""minutiae of workplace grievances."" See Johnson v. Multnomah County, 48 F.3d  at 425 (finding that county employee's criticism of her supervisor as part of the ""good old boy network"" involved in misconduct and mismanagement was speech on a matter of public concern, even though there was evidence that the employee was personally ""embittered""); McKinley v. City of Eloy, 705 F.2d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir.1983) (holding that police officer's public criticism of police pay rate was speech on a matter of public concern because ""[s]peech by public employees may be characterized as not of `public concern' when it is clear that such speech deals with individual personnel disputes and grievances and that the information would be of no relevance to the public's evaluation of the performance of governmental agencies""). The court of appeals has held that ""[o]ne critical inquiry is whether the employee spoke in order to bring wrongdoing to light or merely to further some purely private interest."" Havekost v. U.S. Dep't of Navy, 925 F.2d 316, 318 (9th Cir.1991) (holding that grocery bagger's circulation of petition calling for discharge of head grocery bagger was not speech on a matter of public concern).
While these government criticism cases constitute the scenario most often considered under Connick, numerous cases have applied Connick where, as here, the speech at issue was unrelated to government conduct. These cases, for example, have dealt with comments about political figures as in Rankin and with speaking Spanish on the job as in Yniguez. The Fifth Circuit has held that a high school teacher's supplemental reading list was not speech on a matter of public concern. Kirkland v. Northside Ind. Sch. Dist., 890 F.2d 794, 802 (5th Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 926, 110 S. Ct. 2620, 110 L. Ed. 2d 641 (1990). Further, a firefighter's reading of Playboy Magazine during his off-duty hours at the firehouse has been found to be protected expression related to matters of public concern because the magazine included articles ""relating to politics, sports, arts and entertainment."" Johnson v. County of Los Angeles Fire Dep't, 865 F. Supp. 1430, 1436 (C.D.Cal.1994).
Based on this case law, the Court finds that the pornography topic and the other sexually-oriented topics discussed in Cohen's classes are matters of concern to the community and thus are topics of public concern. The Court further finds that the record shows that the content and form of Cohen's statements addressed these topics. Thus, Cohen's commentary on those topics is commentary on a matter of public concern. Therefore, the first prong of the Connick test for protected government employee speech is satisfied. The Court must now address the balancing prong of the Connick test. 
2. Balancing Test

Because Cohen's speech in assigning sexually focused topics and his commentary on those topics relates to a matter of public concern, the burden shifts to Defendants to show that their legitimate interests outweigh Cohen's First Amendment interests. Rankin, 483 U.S.  at 388, 107 S. Ct.  at 2899; Johnson v. Multnomah County, 48 F.3d  at 421-22. In applying this balancing test, the Court must consider the manner, time, place, and context of the employee's expression. Rankin, 483 U.S.  at 388, 107 S. Ct.  at 2899. The state's burden in justifying the regulation varies according to the nature of the employee's expression. Connick, 461 U.S.  at 150, 103 S. Ct.  at 1691-92. Other pertinent considerations include ""whether the statement impairs discipline by superiors or harmony among co-workers, has a detrimental impact on close working relationships for which personal loyalty and confidence are necessary, or impedes the performance of the speaker's duties or interferes with the regular operation of the enterprise."" Rankin, 483 U.S.  at 388, 107 S. Ct.  at 2899 (citing Pickering v. Board of Educ., 391 U.S. 563, 570-73, 88 S. Ct. 1731, 1735-37, 20 L. Ed. 2d 811 (1968)). Essentially, the state's interest is based on ""the effective functioning of the public employer's enterprise."" 483 U.S.  at 388, 107 S. Ct.  at 2899.
The Court must consider the employer's interest in effectively functioning, and whether that effective function is disrupted. Thomas v. Carpenter, 881 F.2d 828, 830-31 (9th Cir.1989) (holding that sheriff's *1418 deputy could not be penalized for statements made during an election in which he challenged the incumbent sheriff), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1028, 110 S. Ct. 1475, 108 L. Ed. 2d 612 (1990). In so determining the government's interest, the Court should consider whether the statement at issue impairs discipline, co-worker relations, or impedes the performance of the speaker's duties or the operation of the enterprise. Id. at 831. If the speech at issue directly deals with issues of public concern, a stronger showing of disruption is required. Id. (citing McKinley v. City of Eloy, 705 F.2d 1110, 1115 (9th Cir. 1983)). The context of the situation determines how strong a showing must be made. Id. A showing of real, not imagined disruption, is required. McKinley, 705 F.2d  at 1115.
In I.N.S. v. Federal Labor Relations Auth., the Ninth Circuit held that the First Amendment interests of an I.N.S. agent in wearing a pro-union button on his uniform while he was on duty were outweighed by the agency's efficient functioning interest in presenting an easily recognizable image to the public and fostering esprit de corps. 855 F.2d 1454, 1466 (9th Cir.1988). In so holding, the court noted that the regulation at issue was not directed at a particular viewpoint or even at expression per se. Id. Pre-Connick, the Ninth Circuit declined to apply Pickering's protection of public employee speech to police officers publicly critical of police department tactics, stating that ""[s]ubstantial differences between the public interest in education and the public interest in safety and order justify a difference in the standards by which the respective institutions may protect themselves from attempted destruction by their employees."" Byrd v. Gain, 558 F.2d 553, 554 (9th Cir.1977), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1087, 98 S. Ct. 1282, 55 L. Ed. 2d 792 (1978). Byrd's distinction between teachers and police officers has been cited by subsequent Ninth Circuit cases as highlighting the need to consider the context of the statement when applying the second prong of the Connick-Waters test. Thomas, 881 F.2d  at 831; Allen, 812 F.2d  at 432.
In Wheaton v. Webb-Petett, the court of appeals upheld the termination of a managerial state employee who, during informational meetings, made remarks ""unsupportive"" of a new state program to employees responsible for implementing that program. 931 F.2d 613, 618 (9th Cir.1991). The Wheaton court found that, although the manager had a strong interest as a citizen in dissenting as to the new program, that interest was outweighed by the risk that his reiterated objections would endanger the implementation of the new program. Id. In line with that reasoning, the court of appeals has similarly held that an employee's comments on the government's behalf may be restricted by the government. Kotwica v. City of Tucson, 801 F.2d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.1986) (holding that government spokesperson's comments to media on proposed city program, when she had been expressly instructed not to comment on the program, were not protected because of the government's interest in the accurate announcement of its policy).
The Ninth Circuit recently applied the Waters-Connick balancing test to an Arizona law prohibiting state employees from speaking languages other than English on the job. Yniguez v. Arizonans for Official English, 42 F.3d 1217, 1234-35 (9th Cir.1994). In applying the balancing test, the court of appeals found that the state law was unconstitutional, because there was no evidence that the state's interest in efficiency was served by the language prohibition. Id. at 1239. The Ninth Circuit did not directly address the question of whether speaking a language other than English actually qualifies as speech on a matter of public concern but merely noted that the fact that the speech occurred as part of the performance of official duties did not dictate a result. Id. at 1235.
The College brings forth substantial, uncontroverted evidence showing that the educational process was disrupted by Cohen's focus on sexual topics and teaching style. There is testimony from the complaining student and from other students in the class that Cohen's sexually suggestive remarks, use of vulgarities and obscenities, and the topics for discussion prevented them from learning.
Furthermore, written evaluations of Cohen by his colleagues done in November of 1992, *1419 before Murillo filed her grievance against Cohen, show that while his colleagues respected Cohen as a teacher, several of them entertained doubts as to the efficacy of his confrontational teaching methods. According to one peer evaluator who observed a class in which Cohen discussed and assigned a paper on the topic of consensual sex with children, Cohen's specific focus impedes academic success for some students ... I question whether or not many of our students have the academic preparation and/or emotional maturity (stability) to cope with the nature of Mr. Cohen's assignments.
Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj., Bundy Decl., Ex. 14 at 363.
Another observer stated that Cohen's approach to the topic of ""the pros or the cons of consensual sex with children"" did not foster unfettered discussion by students but instead ""require[d] self-censorship rather than complex analysis of an important issue."" Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj., Bundy Decl., Ex. 14 at 361. The evaluator further wrote that, [c]ertainly the issue of what in this society is considered to be sexual abuse deserves discussion. But given the student population, it deserves sensitive, complex discussion  not the reductionist approach that Mr. Cohen's assignment requires. Rather than fostering free inquiry, Mr. Cohen's assignment as stated undermines the crucial nature of the issue.
Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj., Bundy Decl., Ex. 14 at 361.
Lastly, Cohen himself concedes that his teaching methods do not work with every student. He has stated that he deliberately uses an ""abrasive"" teaching style to elicit a response from his students. He admitted during the hearing before the Board that, while his style was effective as to some students, it was not as to others: ""[T]here's always a sort of ratio between success and failure. Techniques work with one student and not another...."" Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj., Bundy Decl., Ex. 17 at 447 (11/11/93 Hearing Tr. at 46). Moreover, in answer to a question as to whether he considered himself an excellent teacher, Cohen replied, ""That would depend on the student. A teacher is good with one student and not so good with another, and that has something to do with the student's perception of the teacher. One cannot be all things to all students."" Opp. to Mot. Prelim. Inj., Bundy Decl., Ex. 17 at 453 (11/11/93 Hearing Tr. at 52).
In fairness, the Court must note that there is evidence in the record that Cohen's teaching style is effective for at least some students. Cohen's colleagues have stated that he is a gifted and enthusiastic teacher. Furthermore, according to the chair of the English Department (who is a defendant in this action), Cohen's teaching style is within the range of acceptable academic practice. The record also contains statements from several students to the effect that Cohen's challenging classroom style contributed to their learning experience. Moreover, the record contains positive student evaluations of Cohen submitted by English 101 and English 015 classes for the Fall 1992 and Fall 1993 semesters. However, this evidence does not controvert the evidence showing that the learning process for a number of students was hampered by the hostile learning environment created by Cohen.
In applying a ""hostile environment"" prohibition, there is the danger that the most sensitive and the most easily offended students will be given veto power over class content and methodology. Good teaching should challenge students and at times may intimidate students or make them uncomfortable. In a different context, the Supreme Court has previously refused to ban all material which offends the sensibilities of society's most sensitive and vulnerable members. Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383-84, 77 S. Ct. 524, 525-26, 1 L. Ed. 2d 412 (1957) (holding that a state statute prohibiting all distribution of written material harmful to minors was ""burn[ing] the house to roast the pig"" because it ""reduce[d] the adult population of Michigan to reading only what is fit for children""). Colleges and universities, as well as the courts, must avoid a tyranny of mediocrity, in which all discourse is made bland enough to suit the tastes of all students.
However, colleges and universities must have the power to require professors to effectively *1420 educate all segments of the student population, including those students unused to the rough and tumble of intellectual discussion. If colleges and universities lack this power, each classroom becomes a separate fiefdom in which the educational process is subject to professorial whim. Universities must be able to ensure that the more vulnerable as well as the more sophisticated students receive a suitable education. The Supreme Court has clearly stated that the public employer must be able to achieve its mission and avoid disruption of the workplace. Within the educational context, the university's mission is to effectively educate students, keeping in mind students' varying backgrounds and sensitivities. Furthermore, the university has the right to preclude disruption of this educational mission through the creation of a hostile learning environment. As the Yniguez court noted, public employers must have the authority to determine what tasks its employees perform. Yniguez, 42 F.3d  at 1235 n. 20.
The restrictions imposed by Defendants are not onerous. The College has required Cohen to issue a syllabus at the beginning of each semester for each of his classes. Cohen must attend a sexual harassment seminar. Cohen must be formally evaluated, and he is directed to ""be sensitive"" to students. These restrictions are tailored and reasonable, in light of the issues involved. The College is not directly censoring Cohen's choice of topics or teaching style. In essence, the College is requiring Cohen to warn students of his teaching style and topics so that those students for whom this approach is ineffective may make an informed choice as to their educations.
Thus, even though Cohen's speech on the topic of pornography was speech on a matter of public interest, the College's interest in effectively educating its students outweighs Cohen's interest in focussing on sexual topics in the classroom, to the extent that the university only requires Cohen to warn potential students of his teaching style and topics.
As an alternative basis for its ruling, the Court recognizes the constitutional implications of the College's substantial interest in preventing the creation of a hostile, sexually discriminatory environment which would disrupt the educational process. The Supreme Court has found that creating a ""hostile environment"" based on gender is a form of sexual harassment which violates Title VII. Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., ___ U.S. ___, ___-___, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L. Ed. 2d 295 (1993); Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404-05, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986).[9] Several circuits, including the Ninth Circuit, have held that sexual harassment is a type of sexual discrimination which violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Bator v. Hawaii, 39 F.3d 1021, 1027 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a claim of sexual harassment ""can be impermissible sex discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause""); Bohen v. City of East Chicago, 799 F.2d 1180, 1185 (7th Cir.1986) (""Sexual harassment of female employees by a state employer constitutes sex discrimination for purposes of the equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment.""); Starrett v. Wadley, 876 F.2d 808, 814-15 (10th Cir.1989) (holding that terminated state employee plaintiff had a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 cause of action for supervisor's propositions, physical contact, and quid pro quo threats).[10] 

*1421 III. Cohen Received Fair Notice Under the Speech Policy, and the Policy is Not Facially Invalid

Cohen further argues that, under the First Amendment, he is guaranteed ""fair notice"" of restrictions on protected speech, and that he did not receive such notice. Cohen's argument fails under the Connick-Waters line of cases which hold that the government as employer has broader procedural, as well as substantive, power in restricting speech. Waters, ___ U.S. at ___, 114 S. Ct.  at 1886. For example, a public employer may prohibit its employees from ""`being rude to customers,'"" a standard that in another context would be impermissibly vague. Waters, ___ U.S. at ___-___, 114 S. Ct.  at 1886-87. Thus, even if the sexual harassment policy at issue here would be considered impermissibly vague or overbroad if applied to the public at large, the Court holds that the College as a public employer has greater substantive and procedural power to regulate its employees' speech, and that the policy therefore is not invalid on its face. Moreover, the Court holds that Cohen received fair notice of what speech was prohibited by the policy.
Cohen cites two cases in which public university ""hate speech"" codes governing student speech were struck down as unconstitutionally vague and overbroad. Although the speech codes in those cases regulated student speech, not just the speech of state employees, their language closely parallels the language at issue here. In Doe v. University of Michigan, the university restricted speech which, among other things ""stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion, sex ... and that ... [c]reates an intimidating, hostile, or demeaning environment for educational pursuits. ..."" 721 F. Supp. 852, 856 (E.D.Mich. 1989). The university speech code further banned ""sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and verbal or physical conduct that stigmatizes or victimizes an individual on the basis of sex ... where such behavior ... [c]reates an intimidating, hostile, or demeaning environment for educational pursuits, employment...."" Id. The district court struck down these regulations as facially vague and overbroad, and as applied. Id. at 864-67.
The UWM Post, Inc. v. Board of Regents court similarly struck down as vague and overbroad University of Wisconsin regulations prohibiting racist or discriminatory comments, epithets or other express behavior directed at an individual ... if such comments ... intentionally: ... [c]reate an intimidating, hostile, or demeaning environment for education....
774 F. Supp. 1163, 1178, 1180 (E.D.Wis.1991); see Dambrot v. Central Michigan Univ., 839 F. Supp. 477 (E.D.Mich.1993) (striking down hate speech code as facially invalid, even though not unconstitutional as applied to university coach under Connick).
However, the speech codes at issue in the above cases all restricted student speech, not merely employee speech as here. The SBVC anti-sexual harassment policy, which restricts only employee speech, is accorded procedural leeway under Connick and is not unconstitutional. This case may thus be distinguished from Doe v. University of Michigan and UWM Post, Inc. v. Board of Regents. 
IV. Conclusion

The Court thus holds that, under Connick and Waters, the College has the authority to require Cohen to distribute a syllabus detailing his controversial teaching style, attend an anti-sexual harassment seminar, and to submit to a formal evaluation of his teaching methods. The College is entitled to issue these narrowly tailored requirements because it has shown that its educational mission has been disrupted for some students by Cohen's teaching style. The College's substantial interest in educating all students, not just the thick-skinned ones, warrants the College's requiring Cohen to put potential students on notice of his teaching methods. The College's interest in fulfilling its educational mission is further bolstered by the constitutional implications of sexual harassment.
*1422 In so holding, the Court notes that this ruling goes only to the narrow and reasonable discipline which the College seeks to impose. A case in which a professor is terminated or directly censored presents a far different balancing question. Further, the Court notes that the College must avoid restricting creative and engaging teaching, even if some over-sensitive students object to it.
Judgment is hereby rendered in Defendants' favor on all of Plaintiff's First Amendment and Cal. Const. art. I., § 2(a) claims.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
NOTES
[1]  The parties have stipulated that the record consists of evidence previously submitted on Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction and Defendants' motion for summary judgment.
[2]  It appears that the consensual sex with children topic is not discussed in his English 015 classes.
[3]  The record is unclear as to what articles were read in Murillo's class. Students from other classes testified that Cohen distributed, as mandatory reading on the pornography topic, an article he had written entitled ""The Film Critic and Pornography."" Ex. 17 at 403, 409. Cohen's article discusses the definition of a ""four-handkerchief movie"" (i.e., a pornographic film which is extremely arousing to the male viewer) and contains the line ""I had an erection in about eight seconds."" Ex. 18 at 205. This article was discussed in those classes.
[4]  The San Bernardino Valley Community College District prohibits sexual harassment by employees. It defines sexual harassment as

unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, written, or physical conduct of a sexual nature. It includes, but is not limited to circumstances in which: ... (2) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's academic performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive learning environment.
SBVC Student Sexual Harassment Plan, Policy 6130.
Under this policy, forms of sexual harassment ""include but are not limited to.... (v)erbal harassment  [d]erogatory comments, jokes or slurs."" Id.
[5]  Defendants argue that this Court cannot grant Cohen's request for injunctive relief because (1) in their individual capacities, none of the remaining Defendants have the power to carry out the requested relief; and (2) in their official capacities, the members of the Grievance Committee do not have the power to carry out the requested relief. Defendants' arguments are not persuasive. Savarese v. Agriss, 883 F.2d 1194, 1209 (3d Cir.1989).
[6]  Cohen does not separately argue his state law claim but states in his Opening Trial Brief that references to the First Amendment should be taken to include the California Constitution as well.

Art. I., § 2(a) of the California Constitution provides that
Every person may freely speak, write and publish his or her sentiments on all subjects, being responsible for the abuse of this right. A law may not restrain or abridge liberty of speech or press.
The California Constitution more broadly protects the right to expression than does the First Amendment. Robins v. Pruneyard Shopping Ctr., 23 Cal. 3d 899, 907, 153 Cal. Rptr. 854, 859, 592 P.2d 341, 346 (1979), aff'd, 447 U.S. 74, 100 S. Ct. 2035, 64 L. Ed. 2d 741 (1980). However, Cohen cites no cases, and there appear to be no cases under the state constitution which protect Cohen's speech in this context.
[7]  See Eugene Volokh, Comment, Freedom of Speech and Workplace Harassment, 39 U.C.L.A. L.Rev. 1791 (1992); see, e.g., Asra Q. Nomani, Was Prof's Lecture Academic Freedom Or Sex Harassment?, Wall St.J., March 7, 1995, at Al.
[8]  The Court notes that cases dealing with high school students may not fully apply in the college or university context. As the Ninth Circuit has written, ""[d]ifferent considerations govern application of the first amendment on the college campus and at lower level educational institutions."" Nicholson v. Board of Educ., 682 F.2d 858, 863 n. 4 (9th Cir.1982). Nonetheless, many of the First Amendment concerns remain the same, regardless of the education level.
[9]  Cohen argues that the fact the complaining party in this case is a student, rather than an employee, makes these cases inapposite. However, it seems clear that the issue in those cases is the status of the harassers  the state employees  not the status of the people harassed. Thus, it is immaterial that the complaining student in this case is not a state employee.
[10]  The College cites Cal.Educ.Code § 212.6, which requires SBVC, along with other educational institutions, to adopt a written policy against sexual harassment. While this possible conflict in duties makes the College's position more sympathetic, this statutory duty does not mandate a decision in the College's favor. Thus, the fact that Defendants were statutorily required to implement this sexual harassment policy has little relevance to this Court's determination of the policy's constitutionality under the First Amendment. Likewise irrelevant is the College's citing of Title IX, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688 (prohibiting sexual harassment in the educational environment) and Franklin v. Gwinnett County Public Schools, 503 U.S. 60, 112 S. Ct. 1028, 117 L. Ed. 2d 208 (1992) (allowing a high school student to maintain a damages claim against her school for a violation of Title IX).

A San Diego State professor who sexually harassed at least four female students, asking one to dress as a French maid, no longer works at the university.

NBC 7 Investigates learned late Tuesday that Professor Vincent Martin was either fired or resigned last Thursday.

Just months after Martin started work at SDSU in fall 2011, a female student accused Martin of harassment. A document obtained by NBC 7 confirms Martin asked that student to meet him at hotel in Seattle and suggested she wear a ""French Maid outfit.""

Since then, SDSU investigators have confirmed Martin sexually harassed three other women who took his Spanish literature classes.


Records show Martin received a 30-day suspension in two of those cases. The university has not yet revealed what punishment, if any, Martin received for harassing the third student.

But late Tuesday afternoon, a university spokesperson revealed that Martin has not been employed at SDSU since last week.


That disclosure was made in an email sent to NBC 7 Investigates. It included no details about Martin’s departure and SDSU administrators were not available to answer to questions about why, and under what terms, Martin left the university.

Neither Martin nor his attorney have offered comment for this story.

In a statement, SDSU administrators said, the university ""is limited, legally, with the disciplinary actions we can take until the faculty exhausts his or her due process."" Read the full statement below.


A decision letter from a previous arbitration hearing revealed Martin resigned from a job at the University of Delaware after he was accused of sexual harassment by a female student.

Just months later, during his first semester at SDSU in fall 2011, he began the same behavior, the documents show.

Martin received an informal warning about his actions, according to the letter, and an SDSU vice president told him his text messages were ""inappropriate."" Martin admitted he should not have sent the French maid text, the letter says.

However, less than two years later, he was accused of sexually harassing two more students.

SDSU administrators released the following statement about the University’s discipline process:

“Faculty at SDSU are employed under a collectively bargained contract that is negotiated at the system level and grants faculty certain rights, even in cases involving claims of sexual harassment. SDSU is limited, legally, with the disciplinary actions we can take until the faculty exhausts his or her due process. SDSU does not have discretion to simply terminate a faculty member without providing these due process rights, per their contract. Faculty are afforded the right to a hearing on the discipline wherein the third party reviewer determines whether the university's discipline is appropriate. SDSU takes all steps to ensure the discipline is appropriate (and appropriately severe) given the specific facts of the case and can be supported and upheld at hearing.”

A San Diego State University Spanish professor, found to have violated the state education code by sexually harassing three women, is appealing the university’s findings and is scheduled to come face-to-face with his alleged victims in an arbitration hearing Wednesday.

SDSU professor Vincent Martin is still teaching classes, despite internal investigations that confirm he sexually harassed at least three of his former students.

Attorney Bibi Fell, who represents one of the women accusing Martin of sexual harassment, said her client will be questioned by Martin's attorney and the university during the arbitration hearing. The women are there as ""witnesses"" and are typically not allowed to have an attorney present.

“To have to sit there in the same room as Professor Martin and be cross-examined about what he did to them is like making them a victim all over again,” Fell said. “I think it's an important case for San Diego, especially for students at SDSU. This is a person that's put in a position of power over a large number of people including women. And so if this is going on at the school, I think it's important to put an end to it.”

One student told NBC 7 Investigates she was harassed through text messages, another by unwelcome touching and sexual comments. A third student said she had a consensual sexual relationship with Martin, but according to an SDSU investigation report, Martin “engaged in conduct sufficiently severe and/or pervasive” with her, and Martin’s overall behavior violated SDSU’s policy against sexual harassment.

Click here to see the complete investigation:

“An arbitration hearing is something that doesn’t go through the formal court system,” Fell said. “It’s a private hearing without a judge with a neutral third party who is making determinations.”


The arbitrator will make a decision based on the testimony and evidence presented at the hearing and ultimately decide Martin's fate.

NBC 7 Investigates reached out to Martin, his attorney and the university for comment. The university said it would not be commenting at this time. NBC 7 Investigates did not hear back from Martin or his attorney. Previously, his attorney told NBC 7 Investigates that Martin disagrees with the findings of the investigation.

“After the appeals process is over, I expect that we will see a confirmation of the underlying findings and some discipline,” Fell said. Regardless of the hearing's outcome, Fell said she will file a civil suit on behalf of her client.

This story has been updated.

When she was studying music at San Diego State in 2014, Jasmine Gonzalez says one of her professors made a humiliating request.

Gonzalez has brittle bone disease and uses a wheelchair to get around. Yet the professor asked her not to use the wheelchair lift, a mechanical device like a small elevator, to access the classroom. She asked if he wanted her to crawl down the stairs. He asked if someone could carry her down instead. She didn’t feel comfortable with either option, but the professor was so insistent she not use the lift, she relented, and crawled down the stairs.

“I had to ask some stranger to carry my wheelchair down, and they did,” Gonzalez said. “It was mortifying.”


Two fellow students who were in the class that day confirmed Gonzalez’s account.

That professor was Patrick Walders, the director of choral studies at SDSU who is currently on paid administrative leave pending a separate investigation related to an allegation he had a sexual relationship with one of his female students.

Walders also runs a choral nonprofit with his wife and works with other performance and church choir groups in San Diego. He’s a prominent figure in the choral world locally and nationally, and he recently made his debut as conductor of the La Jolla Symphony  Chorus. He told the Union-Tribune the new position is a “benchmark in my career.” Walders is now working alongside La Jolla Symphony  Chorus music director Steven Schick, one of the most lauded musicians and conductors in San Diego.


But over the past several months, former coworkers and students of Walders have come forward to share stories of how they say he wields his influence in inappropriate, sometimes disturbing ways. Multiple people told Voice of San Diego they were bullied by Walders.

Emails and phone calls to Walders were not returned. In a written statement, Walders’ lawyer, Matthew English, said any student with complaints about Walders should use the university’s internal grievance procedure: “Any of Dr. Walders’ students who have elected to do so have had their grievances heard and resolved. Dr. Walders has no comment about any individual grievant; such matters are the private and personal concern of the individual student.”

In the fall of 2015, Gonzalez had another uncomfortable run-in with Walders.



At a choir concert rehearsal at College Avenue Baptist Church, Walders asked her if she could leave the stage by going down the ramp facing forward in her wheelchair instead of backward. She told him she has more control, and felt safer going down the ramp backward, as she had been doing. She said Walders insisted she instead face forward down the ramp, because he said it looked bad having her going backward and would make the audience worry.

The day of the choir’s performance at the church, Walders told Gonzalez that she would either have to go down the ramp facing forward or remain onstage in the back corner until the end of the performance. Gonzalez said sitting on stage by herself during songs she wasn’t involved in would make her feel uncomfortable, but she said Walders threatened to fail her if she refused.

So she hid in a corner onstage while other students performed. She said she felt singled out because of her disability.

“He made me feel humiliated and ostracized,” she said.

Carly Cummings, a student who also performed in the church concert, confirmed Gonzalez’s account.

After the concert, Gonzalez filed a complaint with SDSU, alleging Walders discriminated against her because of her disability. There are federal and state laws, plus California State University policy, protecting students from harassment and discrimination, and requiring public universities to quickly and effectively investigate all claims.

In April 2016, Gonzalez got the official results of SDSU’s investigation. In the document, obtained by Voice of San Diego, SDSU investigators called the behavior “highly inappropriate” but said “the behavior more than likely angered and/or upset Gonzalez, which does not constitute an adverse action” and noted the investigation “did not reveal any evidence to substantiate that Walders engaged in behavior that was discriminatory.”

“I left San Diego State after that,” Gonzalez said.

Relationships With Students

Not long after Gonzalez’s troubles with Walders, another female student had a very different experience.

In 2016, Walders was having a sexual relationship with a graduate choral student, according to a copy of a Title IX investigation obtained by Voice of San Diego. SDSU investigators found that Walders and the student were engaged in a consensual relationship that violated a California State University policy barring professors from being in relationships with students they oversee.

The school has yet to discipline Walders. SDSU officials would not comment on the case, citing employee privacy rights.

“Dr. Walders is not at liberty to discuss the details of any ongoing administrative proceeding at SDSU,” English, Walders’ attorney, wrote in a statement. “He respects the integrity of the administrative processes, and wishes to allow any current matter to proceed unimpeded to a fair and just conclusion.”

The student Walders had an affair with spoke with VOSD but asked to remain anonymous because of the professor’s influence on her professional career. She said the sexual affair started after a night when Walders invited her to join him for drinks.

“He claimed that he didn’t start seeing me as attractive until I had recently ‘turned the corner’ in my conducting and singing and had come into my own,” she said via email. “This forever imprinted the association in my mind between his professional approval of my skill set and his sexual attention. We began a sexual relationship that lasted a few months.”

The school was first notified of the relationship after another student anonymously reported it in early 2017. That student, Michael Sakell, is friends with the female student and was Walders’ graduate teaching assistant. As a school employee, he was a mandated reporter, obligated to report harassment and other serious incidents to the school. The investigation didn’t really begin, though, until Sakell later walked in on Walders and the female student kissing during a school trip to Austria, according to the investigation document. Sakell also confirmed the account to Voice of San Diego. The father of the female student involved reported the incident to SDSU, and the student cooperated with the investigation. She said SDSU told her she should refrain from making public comments about the investigation until it was completed.

The student said that after the affair, she lost 20 pounds and became severely depressed. She said she now realizes Walders’ “penchant for using his position of power to manipulate,” and she regrets the relationship, even though it was consensual at the time. She has since left San Diego.

“I should emphasize that I do not feel like a victim, nor do I believe that any of my actions with Patrick were non-consensual in the traditional sense,” she wrote in an email. “I know that I am certainly not the first young woman he has preyed upon, but I am very hopeful that I will be the last. As long as he is allowed to work with organizations to which he has access to young women who are trying to advance their careers, are seeking a mentor, he will continue to be a predator.”

Walders is married to one of his former students. He taught in the music department at James Madison University in Virginia from 2004-2011, according to his SDSU bio. Katie Walders, his wife, was a music student at James Madison University from 2004 to 2008, according to her LinkedIn profile.

“Dr. Walders and his wife never dated while she was his student. Any such rumor to that effect is false,” English wrote in a statement.

Another former student at James Madison University I talked to confirmed she had a one-time sexual encounter with Walders while she was studying music under him. She also asked to remain anonymous, citing concerns about professional opportunities. She said she had sex with Walders one night after he asked her to come to his home to help him learn to speak French. James Madison University prohibits intimate relationships between faculty members and students in their classes or under their supervision.

“He was my biggest mentor,” she said. “The anxiety after we slept together was crippling. I was vomiting the next week — two or three times. I don’t throw up from anxiety. That doesn’t happen to me. It was awful.”

‘He Targeted People’

Some professorial candidates at SDSU have to teach a mock lecture or exhibit lesson plans before they’re hired. Siobahn Sung was an undergraduate student involved in a mock rehearsal and performance of a piece Walders conducted during his interview process in 2011. She said she had awkward encounters with him during that process and found some of his comments inappropriate, so she was vocal that the university shouldn’t hire him. He got the job anyway.

Because she was a music major, Sung had to take choir classes with Walders once he was hired. Sung said Walders required her to work in the choral library for 100 hours to complete her major. That meant she was required to spend even more time with him, and often it was just the two of them. She said Walders bullied her from the moment he started working at SDSU.

“Everybody who was at school at that time, they would say, ‘Patrick has a vendetta for you,’” she said. Sung said Walders quickly became known among music majors as a professor with a bad temper who would favor some students, and single out others.

Jess Barrera, another former student of Walders’, had a similar assessment.


“If you were on his good side and you did everything he asked, you got the good gigs and the special treatment,” Barrera said. “And if you went against him, it was just hell.”

I talked to seven other former students and coworkers who said similar things about Walders and his temper.

Michiko Lohorn, a former staff accompanist at SDSU who worked with Walders, said “he’s a person who wields power ungraciously.”

“He had a super temper and would just lose it,” Lohorn said. “He would just get livid about stuff.”

Allyson Glaser was a student at SDSU who took choir courses with Walders. Glaser grew up secular Jewish and said she wasn’t comfortable with Walders’ religious song choices, nor with performing at the Baptist church near the school where he often scheduled concerts.

Glaser said instead of bringing secular songs into the mix, Walders had her work in the music library when the rest of the students were rehearsing religious songs. At performances, she said he made her walk on and off the stage alone when the choir sang secular songs. She said the experience has given her performance anxiety.

“I started getting panic attacks after that,” she said.

Brandon Thibeault, another former SDSU student, had similar grievances when it came to Walders’ requirements to perform in churches. Thibeault said Walders required his class to participate in a church service as part of a performance.

“I told him that I was uncomfortable participating in a church service and would not be in attendance for the ‘optional’ service, and when I didn’t show up to the gig I told him I would not be attending for those reasons, he failed me,” Thibeault said via Facebook messenger.

He said he filed a grievance with SDSU’s student ombudsman, and said the investigators concluded that he should have been allowed to drop the course – but that Walders was not disciplined. SDSU declined to confirm or deny Thibeault’s account, but an employee at the school who was involved in the grievance process confirmed the incident.

“The school still didn’t take any action on that,” Thibeault wrote.

It’s not clear what SDSU will do, if anything, in response to its finding that Walders violated the CSU policy barring relationships between professors and students they oversee. CSU policy only says Walders is “subject to discipline commensurate with the violation.”

Update: After this story was published, the La Jolla Symphony  Chorus placed Walders on administrative leave until further notice, Diane Salisbury, the group’s executive director, confirmed Friday.

                San Diego State music professor Patrick Walders has dropped the defamation lawsuit against a former student. 
Walders had filed a lawsuit in April, accusing his former students Michael Sakell and Jess Barrera of defamation, claiming they had spread misinformation to his colleagues and other professionals regarding an alleged sexual relationship he had with one of his female students. 
While Walders remains on administrative leave from his post as an associate professor and director of choral studies at SDSU, he filed a motion to drop the lawsuit against Sakell without “prejudice,” which means he could still potentially pursue the lawsuit in the future. Walders is seeking a default judgment against Barrera, who did not respond to his original motion. 
Walders was accused of sexual misconduct in February of last year, after his then teaching assistant Sakell claimed to have walked in on him and another female student kissing during a university-sponsored trip to Austria. 
He was placed on paid administrative leave shortly thereafter while officials investigated the matter.




Soon, after being placed on administrative leave from SDSU, the executive director of the La Jolla Symphony  Chorus announced that they were also placing Walders on leave until further notice.
According to public court files, Sakell submitted a copy of the university’s investigation, revealing that the alleged affair began between the student and the married Walders on fall of 2016. At the time, the student had been a graduate assistant for Walders and was in four of his classes. 
It wasn’t until 2017, when Sakell walked in on an intimate encounter between the pair, that the affair ended. The student cut her trip short and immediately returned to the United States after the incident. 
Sakell’s lawyer Nicholas Moore issued a statement that said Walders’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit demonstrated that Sakell is an honest person “who spoke truth to power.”
In a statement made to the San Diego Union Tribune, Walders’ attorney Matthew English said his client had dropped the lawsuit in order to focus on administrative proceedings at SDSU.
The proceedings will determine what course of disciplinary action the university will take, if any. 
Neither the status of the investigation, which falls under the provisions of Title IX, nor information regarding the administrative proceedings has been made public.  
SDSU spokesperson La Monica Everett-Haynes confirmed via email on Sept. 6 that Walders remains on staff, but is currently not overseeing the choirs or conducting. 
Walders started teaching at SDSU in 2011 and has faced numerous complaints throughout his time with the university. 
They ranged from students saying he had a bad temper and showed favoritism, to some saying they felt humiliated by him. 




Jasmine Gonzalez, a former student of Walders, felt humiliated when he asked her not to use the wheelchair lift, instead either crawling down the stairs or having someone carry her. 
Gonzalez eventually filed a complaint with the university, saying that Walders singled her out due to her disability. 
Officials conducted an investigation, but failed to discipline the professor and only calling his behavior inappropriate.
Another former student said Walders failed him simply because he didn’t feel comfortable singing religious music.
The student said he also filed a grievance with SDSU, but said Walders was never disciplined.
Similar complaints from other students followed, but it wasn’t until a sexual misconduct allegation was made that university began investigating.
It remains unclear when the administrative proceedings will end or what decision the university will take.
Editor’s Note: This story has been updated to match the printed version and to correct an earlier online version that mentioned the lawsuit being dropped for both students instead of one, and to correct Title VI to Title IX. We apologize for the error and confusion.

                The pre-trial hearing for former SF State professor Mark Landis was postponed until Jan. 6 due to his absence, said Superior Court Judge Harold Kahn today in court.
According to defense attorney Thanh Ngo, Landis did not have to be present since his charges are still considered misdemeanors.
Landis, 38, was charged with a 16th count of invasion of privacy during his pretrial motions hearing in September for allegedly filming students while using his restroom during parties he hosted at his Castro home in July 2013, Xpress previously reported.
During his motions and services hearing, Assistant District Attorney Laura Carwile issued an expanded protective order that required Landis to keep a distance of 150 yards and prohibited any form of contact with the victims.
Ngo, said that the protective order was excessive since Landis had not tried to contact any of the victims in the case.
Landis was an associate accounting professor at SF State from 2006 before his leave of absence in November 2013. He resigned from SF State July 18, days prior to his arrest, according to SF State spokesperson Ellen Griffin.
Thanh Ngo entered a not guilty plea to all 15 charges July 29 on behalf of the former professor.
Landis is scheduled to appear in court Jan. 6 at the Hall of Justice.

Sam Swofford alsois a former superintendent of the Lodi Unified School District.Dolberg, 60, said he has not beendisciplined and is teaching classes this semester. After the panel completedthe report in late July, Dolberg requested that an independent arbitrator hearthe case to determine whether sexual harassment occurred and what, if any, disciplineis warranted, attorneys for both men said. That hearing has not yet been scheduled,they said.According to the panel's report,Dolberg's contact with Steven Swofford included suggestions that he pose forphotos in his underwear at an ""isolated"" photo shoot. Saying he wanted to helpSwofford pursue a modeling career, Dolberg also gave the student Internet printoutsof partially nude male models, investigators found.Swofford declined to comment forthis story. Through his attorney, Davey Turner, Swofford filed a formal complaintwith the college in November. Turner said his client does not plan to sue butwants Dolberg to lose his job as an instructor -- a job Turner said Dolberghas held since 1975.Dolberg is married with five children.He formerly served as a bishop in the Brookside congregation of the Church ofJesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he said.Reached at his Delta College officethis week, Dolberg also declined to comment on the allegations. His attorney,Craig Rasmussen, said the student misinterpreted Dolberg's contact. Swofford""very oddly attached ... sexual connotations to these efforts from Dr. Dolbergto help (Swofford out with his career,"" Rasmussen said.Dolberg contacted Swofford severaltimes on campus, on the phone and with notes passed through other students,all in an attempt to arrange a photo shoot, according to the report. Dolbergsaid he was an amateur photographer, but investigators concluded that the teacher""has not taken courses, participated in contests or done any other professionalmodeling photography that would qualify him to assist Mr. Swofford in a modelingcareer.""According to the report, Dolbergacknowledged wanting to keep the prospective photo shoot on the ""'down low'(in confidence so as to avoid any possible misinterpretation by others.""Dolberg denied pressuring the studentto take part in a photo shoot and described his contact with Swofford as hisnormal correspondence when trying to help a student develop a possible career.Voters elected Dolberg to the StocktonUnified board in 1998. He serves Area 7, which includes Stagg High School andother schools in north Stockton.

A record of the incident will also be placed in Hermassi's permanent personnel file, university officials said.Spokesmen for both  universities said they believe their actions for sexual harassment were the most severe taken recently by any university in the county."

http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_23451337/san-jose-state-professor-accused-sexual-assault-no,"SAN JOSE — A San Jose State lecturer accused by a student last August of sexual assault is no longer at the university. 
University President Mo Qayoumi announced the departure of Jeffry Mathis in a carefully worded message last week toï»¿ a group of students who demanded Mathis’ ouster in a petition on change.org.  
The students were outraged by an NBC 11 story that aired last month in which a crying, unidentified student accused Mathis of straddling and groping her in a secluded office and not letting her leave when she came to ask about her grade. Their petition, posted in May, received more than 600 signatures. 
“We care very deeply for this school,” said Sasha Bassett, one of the San Jose State students involved in the campaign. “The fact that it had gone nine months unresolved disgusted and hurt us.”
Qayoumi’s message, emailed by his chief of staff to Bassett and several other students, assured the group that the administration was also concerned and noted that the university strives to “promptly, carefully and thoroughly” investigate all such complaints. 
“Regarding the allegations made in the news report, the University conducted a thorough internal investigation in addition to a police investigation immediately after the student filed the complaint,” the email concluded. 				
“Based on those investigations, the University took appropriate action. Because this is a personnel matter, the specific details of the actions taken are confidential. However, Mr. Mathis is no longer employed by SJSU.”
Attempts to contact Mathis were not immediately successful. San Jose State’s campus police began investigating the case on the night of the alleged attack and referred the case to the Santa Clara County district attorney last fall, said SJSU spokeswoman Pat Harris. The D.A.’s office did not file charges, said the agency’s public information officer, Lisa McCrary. The student who filed the complaint against Mathis with campus police told NBC she met the kinesiology lecturer in the Spartan Complex to ask why he had given her a D+ the past semester.				
“He looked at me and touched me and said, ‘How do you want to better your grade?'” the student said in the recorded television interview. “He kept coming closer to me and my body completely shut down. He continued to touch me and try to talk about the ways that I could better my grade.”
Mathis apologized in an email to the student the following day, NBC reported — and offered to change her grade “for free.”
“I’ve been thinking about last night and I have come to the conclusion that I made a terrible mistake in how I handled that situation,” the email reportedly said. “I will change your grade to a B- for free, because it is the right way to handle this.”
The university has declined to discuss details of its handling of the case, but issued a statement about its commitment to the safety of students and employees. 
In his message to students — which was also released by a university spokeswoman — Qayoumi wrote:
“We share your concern about the recent NBC 11 story describing an alleged sexual battery case at SJSU involving a lecturer, Jeffry Mathis and a female student. We are writing today to let you know that SJSU cares about and is firmly committed to providing a safe environment for everyone in the campus community. 
“We strive to implement timely and appropriate actions to protect our community members, including promptly, carefully and thoroughly investigating all complaints, followed by appropriate responses and actions. 
“If there is any reason to believe a crime has occurred or safety is at risk, the University Police Department is contacted, and if appropriate, the matter is referred to the Santa Clara County District Attorney.”
Mathis appears to have been a popular academic. Students gave him good reviews on the site RateMyProfessors.com, remarking on his sense of humor and efforts to get to know his students. One student called him “socially aware,” and wrote that “he really cares about students being comfortable in his class.”

https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/10/12/lewis-aptekar-sjsu-professor-who-sexually-harassed-student-resigns/,"SAN JOSE–Lewis Aptekar, the San Jose State professor who sexually harassed a student in 2015, is leaving the university.
“I’m writing to let you know that, effective immediately, Dr. Lewis Aptekar has resigned from his faculty position,” Paul Cascella, interim dean of the College of Education, wrote in an email to faculty in the counselor education department Thursday afternoon.
The university will pay Aptekar $75,000 and will remove references to his suspension from his personnel file, according to a settlement reached with the university — a copy of which was obtained by the Mercury News.
Aptekar, 72, had alleged that the university violated his due process rights during an investigation into the sexual harassment claim against him, a claim the university denied. “This settlement is a compromise of disputed claims and is not an admission by any party of any liability,” the document says.
The professor, who has faced multiple allegations of sexual harassment in the last several years, had been scheduled to return to teaching this semester after a temporary suspension. But he was removed from the teaching roster after students and fellow professors protested his return.
On Sept. 30, Aptekar sent a one-sentence resignation letter to the interim senior associate vice president of university personnel, Elizabeth Pugliese, saying he was stepping down “due to personal reasons.”

As part of the settlement, Aptekar’s resignation is irrevocable. He has also agreed not to accept any job offer within the California State University system.
According to the settlement, the university has agreed to provide Aptekar’s prospective employers only the date he was hired, the date he resigned, the position he held and his salary. But “because of free speech protections, the university cannot control information provided by non-administrators,” the settlement notes.				
Under the settlement, Aptekar will retain faculty member access to the university’s library system.
In 2016, the Mercury News revealed that Aptekar had remained the head of the counselor education department for nearly five months after the school concluded he sexually harassed a student. Later, it came to light that Aptekar had been accused of making sexually charged comments to students in 2014.
“I can’t believe it took this long, honestly,” said Valerie Lamb, a graduate student in the counselor education department who had organized a sit-in protesting Aptekar’s presence on campus. “It feels surreal because we fought so hard.”
“I’m relieved we won’t have to deal with this anymore, but I’m disappointed with the way it was handled,” Lamb added. “He wasn’t the first and he won’t be the last professor to do this, and I hope San Jose State will take initiative when they find a professor has sexually harassed a student.”

							     [Civ. No. 69794. Court of Appeals of California, Second Appellate District, Division Two.  October 24, 1984.]  DONALD V. COCKBURN, Plaintiff and Respondent, v. SANTA MONICA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT PERSONNEL COMMISSION, Defendant and Appellant; SANTA MONICA COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT, Real Party in Interest and Appellant.  (Opinion by Roth, P. J., with Compton and Gates, JJ., concurring.)  COUNSEL  Jones  Matson and Urrea C. Jones, Jr., for Defendant and Appellant and for Real Party in Interest and Appellant.  Grubbs  Collins and V. James Smith for Plaintiff and Respondent.  OPINION  ROTH, P. J.  The Santa Monica Community College District Personnel Commission (Commission) and Santa Monica Community College District (College) appeal from the judgment of the superior court granted in favor of Donald Cockburn (respondent) pursuant to his petition for writ of mandate to set aside the decision of the Commission rendered on December 22, [161 Cal. App. 3d 737] 1981, which terminated his employment with College as an instructor and ordered his dismissal.  The superior court judgment rendered on December 25, 1983, set aside and vacated the Commission's decision and ordered the Commission to reinstate respondent, redetermine the penalty of dismissal, and impose a penalty not inconsistent with its opinion. Paragraph two thereof recites in pertinent part: ""2. As a condition of reemployment, Petitioner shall continue with regularly scheduled psychological consultations until such time as Dr. Marshall Levy or other competent psychologist renders a written report to Real Party in Interest's Administrative Dean of Personnel Services that Petitioner has been rehabilitated.""  Respondent had been employed by College as a laboratory technician and instructor in the physical sciences department for approximately 17 years. His job included hiring and supervising student laboratory assistants.  Duria Suncar, an 18 year old Oriental student at the college, asked respondent about employment as a lab assistant. On February 6, 1981, she was interviewed by respondent. A complaint filed with College on February 20, 1981, by Duria alleges the following occurred on February 6: ""Complainant, Doria Suncar, was sent to be interviewed for work in the chemistry lab by Dell Wade in Financial Aids. [Respondent] met her and put her to work immediately washing beakers. He then asked her to come with him to the basement to do some work. In the basement he held her hand, asking how her hands felt washing all those dishes. He then grabbed her, holding her tightly. He kissed her on the cheek then on the mouth, saying afterwards, 'o.k., go to work.' Five or ten minutes later he tried to embrace her again. Complainant said 'no, I don't want to.' In about five minutes she told him she was leaving. She did not return. Two weeks later she returned to Financial Aids and asked for another job. She said she had not come back sooner because she was confused, and then told Ms [sic] Wade what had happened in the Chemistry lab.""  The sexual assault outlined above was admitted by respondent and is fortified by abundant uncontradicted evidence. It was the sole basis of the Commission's decision. The judgment of the superior court vacated it for the reason that respondent prior to his hearing had not received a notice as required by Education Code section 87031 fn. 1 andMiller v. Chico Unified School Dist. (1979) 24 Cal. 3d 703 [157 Cal. Rptr. 72, 597 P.2d 475]. [161 Cal. App. 3d 738]  [1] The California Supreme Court has construed Education Code section 87031 to require that ""Unless the school district notifies the employee of such derogatory material within a reasonable time of ascertaining the material, so that the employee may gather pertinent information in his defense, the district may not fairly rely on the material in reaching any decision affecting the employee's employment status."" (Miller v. Chico Unified School Dist., supra, 24 Cal. 3d 703, 713.) fn. 2  [2] Our perusal of the record convinces us that appellants complied in all respects with the Education Code and Miller. Respondent had notice within reasonable and ample time as required of any and all prior misconduct and/or derogatory statements available to appellants and did actually avail himself of its use.  We proceed to detail the sequence of the events prior to the hearing before the Commission.  On February 24, 1981, Dean Gelvin met with respondent and Richard Masada, chairman of the College's physical science department, to discuss the complaint. Respondent was advised that ""this type of alleged conduct"" was unprofessional, the authority in supervisory relationship was not to be abused, and told that his future job performance would be monitored. The substance of a second meeting between the three held on March 5 was memorialized in a document dated March 6 and is identified as ""Permanent Employee --Unsatisfactory Job Performance--Second Notice."" This notice, among other things, indicated that ""[Respondent] has failed to comply with the Merit System Rule [5.1300.3.] All fellow employees must receive courteous treatment."" The notice also stated: ""The additional improvement required [of respondent]: Student employees must be treated with respect. It is expected that all students employed in the physical science department will receive the same treatment. No behavior with sexual overtones will be permitted in the laboratory or basement stockroom areas."" The notice went on to state: ""Mr. Masada and Mrs. Gelvin will be available to discuss with respondent any situations that arise at any time. If there are difficulties which we cannot resolve or consider beyond our abilities, we shall assist [respondent] in finding appropriate counseling to deal with this problem.  ""Additional improvement in job performance must be made in the immediate future. You will be reevaluated on May 5, 1981. If satisfactory [161 Cal. App. 3d 739] improvement has not been made you may be subject to future disciplinary action.""  The reference in the ""second notice"" to section 5.1300.3 lists dismissal as a penalty for its violation.  On April 2 a meeting was held between Chairman Masada, Dean Gelvin, Dr. Richard Moore, president of the College, Dean Benita Haley, administrative dean of personnel services and Ms. Vance. At this meeting Ms. Vance told the group that ""similar"" complaints had been lodged against respondent.  On April 3, Dean Haley and Dr. Moore met once more with respondent. The pertinent issues discussed at this meeting were memorialized in a letter dated April 6 signed by respondent and the administrative dean as follows:  ""Dear [Respondent]:  ""I requested a meeting with you on April 3, 1981, as a result of a thorough review of your 'Unsatisfactory Job Performance --Second Notice' signed on March 6, 1971. Dr. Richard Moore, superintendent and president attended our meeting.  ""The purpose of the meeting was to discuss with you the topic of the unsatisfactory notice which was a complaint filed on February 20, 1981, by Duria Suncar, a student helper, describing sexual harassment.  ""You were reminded that you have been made aware of 'over-familiarity with female student helpers' in a 'Notice of Need for Work Improvement' on October 20, 1977, and that this continued willful failure of good conduct tending to injure public service was a sufficient single cause for recommending your dismissal to the Board of Trustees. (Merit System Rule 5.1300.3-A) During the discussion that Dr. Moore and I had with you, you admitted that the complaint was an accurate account of what had occurred between Duria Suncar and yourself on Feb. 6, 1981 regretted the incident had ever occurred, stated no such actions with students had ever been taken by you before, and said nothing like that would occur again.  ""It is our decision that a recommendation will be made for your dismissal. However, Dr. Moore advised you that the recommendation to dismiss would be delayed for a two month period. During the next two months you are to have eight one-hour meetings with the college psychologist, Dr. Lynne Boylan. The week of June 8 you are to make an appointment with [161 Cal. App. 3d 740] Dr. Moore and me at which time a decision will be made regarding a recommendation for dismissal.""  Dr. Boylan on April 8, by letter, advised Dean Haley that to avoid any conflict of interest charges it would be wise to substitute a psychologist independent of the college. She recommended Dr. Marshall Levy.  In response to Dean Haley's request for an evaluation of respondent, on April 29 Dr. Levy said he would accept the employment if appellant would ""communicate his current situation to his wife.""  Respondent, after calling on Dr. Levy, decided he would not submit to evaluation on that condition. On May 4, 1981, he informed Dean Haley that he would retire and on that day submitted his request for retirement to the board of trustees of College. The board accepted respondent's offer to retire and on the same day notified Dean Haley. Dean Haley advised respondent of the board's action by letter dated May 9, 1981. However, on May 6, 1981, two days after Dean Haley had delivered respondent's retirement request to the board of trustees and after it had been accepted by the board, Dean Haley advised Dr. Levy that College desired to retain his services for 12 therapy sessions with respondent. Respondent agreed to ask his wife to participate in the sessions as required.  On June 15, 1981, respondent, by hand written letter to Dr. Moore advised that it was the opinion of Dr. Levy ""... I am qualified to continue working in my job. He stated ... he knows ... I would never again commit such an act ...."" Respondent then withdrew his request for retirement. On July 27, 1981, Dr. Levy reported his study by letter addressed to James L. Grubbs who had been retained by respondent as counsel.  On August 4, the board of trustees of College rejected respondent's withdrawal of his request to retire and dismissed him.  There is a distinction we think in a proceeding before the board which was initiated by respondent with a written request for retirement followed by a request to the board to withdraw such request after its acceptance and a proceeding initiated by the board wherein the board makes charges and holds a hearing to enable respondent to reply to the same. The parties however, treated the board's denial of the retirement request as the board's decision to dismiss respondent on the charge of misconduct of which respondent had been given written notice. Respondent appealed to the Commission on that theory and appellants accepted it. [161 Cal. App. 3d 741]  Appearing before the Commission respondent charged that the punishment imposed by board was excessive and board had relied not on the Suncar incident, the single charge against respondent, but also on documents or complaints with which he should have been but was not confronted as required by Education Code section 87031.  On December 11, 1981, the Commission found as follows: ""1. That on August 4, 1981, at a regular meeting, The Board of Trustees of the Santa Monica Community College District took action to dismiss the [respondent] for cause as stated in Personnel Commission Rule 5.1300.3-A 'willful failure of good conduct tending to injure the public service,' alleging that [respondent's] conduct toward Ms. Duria Suncar on February 6, 1981, was discourteous and inappropriate.  ""2. That prior to this meeting the [respondent] was notified of the charges and at this meeting the [respondent] was given the opportunity to respond before action was taken by the Board.  ""3. That the [respondent] has stated by declaration that on February 6, 1981, he approached Ms. Duria Suncar, a student worker in his charge, and grabbed and held her tightly and kissed her on the cheek and attempted physical contact a second time which she objected to and rejected.  ""4. That in his position as Laboratory Technician, Physical Science, [respondent] was responsible for the supervision of several student assistants, placing him in a position of responsibility and trust.  ""5. That the procedure for dismissal prescribed in Rule 5.1300.50 was properly carried out by the Board.  ""6. That the procedure prescribed in Education Code 87031 and rule 7.300, which provides for the notification of the [respondent] by the Administration whenever information of a derogatory nature is placed in District personnel records, was not properly followed by the Board in several instances."" The Commission then rendered the following decision: ""Pursuant to the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Personnel Commission makes the following decision:  ""1. That [respondent] breached his trust and responsibility for the supervision of students.  ""2. That [respondent's] conduct toward Ms. Suncar on ""February 6, 1981, constitutes failure of good conduct and is sufficient cause for dismissal. [161 Cal. App. 3d 742]  ""3. That the action of dismissal by the Board be sustained.  ""4. That all materials maintained by the District which do not bear the signature of the originator and which were not presented to the [respondent] prior to entry in the District files be purged and destroyed.""  On February 13, 1983, respondent filed a petition for a writ of mandate in superior court. After a hearing, judgment was entered as recited in the opening paragraph hereof. This appeal followed.  We have assumed that section 87031 as construed byMiller, supra, 24 Cal. 3d 703, means that respondent had the right to know within a reasonable time any of the derogatory evidence, oral or written, that would be used against him at the hearing before the board or Commission. The question was first raised by respondent before the Commission by way of Education Code section 87031. Respondent appeared before the Board on August 4, 1981, and before the Commission in late November 1981.  The specific allegedly omitted derogatory complaints identified by respondent consist of: 1. A letter from Ms. Vance to Dick Wohlgemuth, the then physical sciences department chairman, dated June 29, 1978. In this letter Ms. Vance states: ""We have, to date, received four complaints against [respondent] .... The complainants have all stated that [respondent] has made lewd remarks about and to women and has on occasion put his hands on them in a suggestive manner.""  2. An unsigned complaint by Claudia Thoreson, received by Ms. Vance on June 12, 1978.  3. An unsigned complaint by David Moore, received by Ms. Vance on June 12, 1978.  The exhibits fn. 3 before the Commission demonstrate respondent was fully informed not only of all the conversations between members of the faculty [161 Cal. App. 3d 743] heretofore set forth at which he was present, but also of the substance of such conversations at which he was not present and at which complaints against him had been discussed, all of which took place during the investigation made by faculty members after a specific complaint was filed on February 20, 1981, by Duria. Respondent was immediately alerted and told under the euphemism of evaluation of his work and/or for work improvement as an instructor he was being evaluated by reason of the Suncar incident on a psychological basis and actually advised to seek psychiatric treatment. However, when his peers decided after much discussion that a specific complaint must be filed, a complaint was filed charging him with ""... wilful failure of good conduct leading to injure the public service ... [and] recommendation for dismissal ..."" he was and had been specifically advised of the reasons therefor.  The exhibits show a complete knowledge by respondent of the Wohlgemuth (1978) incident. They contain letters from students hired by respondent complimenting respondent as an instructor employed during those prior years hopefully as rebuttal to the prior complaint with which he was confronted. It is worth noting too, that the exhibits demonstrate how respondent, weeks before any counsel appeared on his behalf, was kept meticulously informed by appellants of all of his rights in writing before he delivered his request for retirement to the Board and after it had been accepted by the Board.  Finally, the exhibits embrace the complete written report of Dr. Levy dated July 27, 1981, addressed to respondent's counsel which states in one of its opening paragraphs his knowledge of the effort of College to properly evaluate the Suncar incident and its significance with respect to continued employment by College. Thus if further proof were required of respondent's knowledge of prior complaints of ""... over familiarity with female student helpers ..."" the doctor's letter supplies it.  ""The patient understands your referral as being for the purpose of evaluating his emotional status and further acknowledges that he was aware that the findings and recommendations would be communicated to his employer and might thus further jeopardize his employment status. Though a great deal of information was obtained in the course of the evaluation, I am limiting this report to those issues relating to and thus seen as pertinent to his continued employment. I urge this material be treated with the maximum of discretion and confidentiality. [Italics added.] [161 Cal. App. 3d 744]  ""Present Situation  ""The patient is charged under the public service merit system with violation of rule 5.1300.3A. Specifically, the patient is charged with sexual harassment growing out of an incident on February 6, 1981, and a subsequent complaint lodged by the student on February 20, 1981.  ""The official complaint by the student indicates that after having been put to work on her initial day of employment, washing beakers in the chemistry lab, the patient held the student's hand, asking how her hands felt, and then holding her tightly, kissed her on the cheek, then on the mouth, saying afterwards, 'Okay, go to work.'  ""Five or ten minutes later, he attempted to embrace the student again and she said, 'No, I don't want to.' The student left about five minutes after the last incident and did not return to work, reporting to Financial Aides [sic], asking for another job, explaining what had transpired, and indicating that she had not come back sooner because she was confused.  ""It should be noted that a prior need for improvement notice, dated October 20, 1977, is contained in the patient's personnel file and refers to 'over-familiarity with female student helpers.' The patient denied all allegations in the 1977 reprimand regarding over-familiarity with females students, noting that he had not been stand-offish and distant from students, saying they are people also.  ""In contrast to the denial of the 1977 allegation, the patient admits to all essential details as noted in the student's charges, dated February 20, 1981, and referring to the above-noted incident, dated February 6, 1981. When asked to explain his obviously inappropriate behavior, the patient spoke of being upset, shocked and amazed, adding that he hadn't slept well and remains concerned over the loss of his job and 'deplorable behavior.'""  In pertinent part, the report also states: ""It is my opinion that this patient can be rehabilitated without presenting a danger to himself or others. Specifically, the possibility of a recurrence of the above behavior appears to be very minimal given ongoing therapy and monitoring ....  ""A critical focus in assuring appropriate control of behavior should be to concentrate in therapy on the patient making ongoing appropriate connections between the critical intervening variable between himself and his behavior, namely his feelings .... Specifically, the following treatment plan is recommended to assure that this patient will not reoffend: [161 Cal. App. 3d 745]  ""1. Individual psychotherapy, coupled with conjoint marital therapy on a once-weekly basis. (This will offer the therapist an opportunity to make significant interventions in the family constellation as well as obtain ongoing data.)  ""2. With the permission of the patient and his wife, this therapist would be willing to monitor the patient's progress as well as report to the school psychologist on an as-needed basis.""  When the board met on August 4, 1981, presumably it had before it all the exhibits including, with respondent's consent, the Dr. Levy letter of July 27. Respondent was represented by counsel at the board hearing and had full knowledge of all the evidence in the exhibits. We find nothing to show the use before the board of any prior derogatory statements and/or prior misconduct of which respondent did not have prior notice and knowledge.  There is nothing inMiller, supra, 24 Cal. 3d 703 or in Education Code sections 87031, 44031 or 44664 which requires appellants to give a specific written notice detailing prior derogatory remarks or misconduct which may be used in aid of a specific charge and that what occurred in Miller with respect to a general charge of incompetence (wherein the omissions were actually a part of the intrinsic proof of the incompetence generally charged). At bench there was a specific charge proved beyond a reasonable doubt.  The Commission, however, although in our opinion it would have been justified to do so, did not use any of the prior misconduct or derogatory statements, and implicitly repudiated the same by its statement that prior derogatory conduct and/or statements ""... was not properly before the Board ...."" Its findings are incisive as is its disposition of the single charge before it.  ""1. That respondent breached his trust and responsibility for the supervision of students.  ""2. That respondent's conduct toward Ms. Suncar on February 6, 1981, constitutes failure of good conduct and is sufficient cause for dismissal.""  [3] The question remaining is the propriety of the judgment of dismissal imposed by the Commission. Concededly the specific charge made against respondent is true. It is admitted by the express terms of the superior court judgment which disapproves of the dismissal but recommends the consideration of a judgment less absolute and more favorable to respondent. [161 Cal. App. 3d 746]  We do not agree the judgment of the Commission is excessive nor does the record in any logical or sound respect by substantial evidence and/or the weight of the evidence suggest the Commission abused its discretion when it imposed the judgment of dismissal.  If however one assumes the judgment appealed from is sound, such assumption must rest wholly upon the opinion expressed by the psychologist in his letter of July 27, 1981. When the letter is analyzed in the light of the admitted facts and those inherent in the judgment appealed from the inevitable conclusion which must be drawn is that College cannot without great moral and financial risk to College and the general public reinstate respondent even temporarily. In our opinion too, College has no pragmatic option to employ respondent in any capacity even if and when respondent is reported to be completely rehabilitated.  ThusEbersol v. Cowan (1983) 35 Cal. 3d 427, 434 [197 Cal. Rptr. 601, 673 P.2d 271], holds: ""... if the agency [for third party action purposes] knew or should have known of the dangerous propensities Mark Cates exhibited in the instant case it might have had a duty to advise persons foreseeably coming in contact with the student."" (See also Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California (1976) 17 Cal. 3d 425 [131 Cal. Rptr. 14, 551 P.2d 334, 83 A.L.R.3d 1166];Peterson v. San Francisco Community College Dist. (1984) 36 Cal. 3d 799, 807, 809, 815 [205 Cal. Rptr. 842, 685 P.2d 1193].)  Analyzed in the light of the record the psychologist's opinion ventured in his July 27 letter is not sound and certainly is not one sufficient to set aside and nullify the decision of the Commission on the ground that the Commission abused its discretion in assessing a proper punishment.  We have explored the evidence in more than usual detail as it almost demonstrates an impeachment of the opinion of Dr. Levy. To illustrate: the record shows Dr. Levy rendered the same opinion to respondent on or some days prior to June 15 approximately six weeks before July 27, 1981. In pertinent part the letter in its opening paragraph says: ""The patient was seen in my offices on July 17 and July 18, 1981, for a total of nine hours of interviews and psychological diagnostic testing ....""  On June 15, respondent transmitted to Dr. Moore, president of the College as his reason for withdrawing his request to retire the opinion of Dr. Levy expressed to him that he could be rehabilitated. In the written report and prognosis dated July 27, Dr. Levy fixes July 17 and 18 as the days on which he spent a total of nine hours with respondent. If there were any prior [161 Cal. App. 3d 747] treatments they are not mentioned in the letter of July 27. On the results accumulated in those July hours the doctor elects to base his prognosis to the effect respondent can be rehabilitated but only on condition that respondent continue treatment as is ordered by paragraph 2 of the superior court judgment set forth in the opening paragraphs of this opinion.  Further, the doctor's opinion shows respondent's rehabilitation is conditioned in an important respect by a continuance of respondent's marital relationship which has been subjected to serious strain in the past. Dr. Levy is optimistic that the marital situation too can be with psychological help satisfactorily adjusted.  Dr. Levy signs his letter of July 27 as a Ph.D. licensed clinical psychologist/forensic, and states in part: ""Parenthetically, it should be noted that some problems reflecting difficulty in short-term memory appear to reflect a relatively long-term static condition dating back to a plane crash [respondent] suffered as a Marine pilot in World War II. While he has evidently compensated for this difficulty, further examination is recommended to rule out the 1 percent chance of an active rather than static lesion.""  Parenthetically we note he is not an M.D. and clearly not a specialist on dormant lesions. We do not consider him qualified even on a ""forensic"" basis to express an opinion on a 1 percent possibility that the accident suffered by respondent as a Marine pilot in World War II resulted in ""an active or other than a static lesion.""  Thus if and when ""a written report [has been rendered] that respondent has been rehabilitated"" by ""... Dr. Marshall Levy or other competent psychologist"" respondent must be automatically and permanently reinstated.  Could a hearing be requested? Would the report of a psychiatrist or any other evidence be acceptable? Assuming that paragraph 2 of the judgment is valid, it is uncertain, inequitable to all the parties and it abdicates judicial authority.  The litigation before this court is not a child custody contest wherein judicial authority is on occasion in large part usurped by experts. At bench the judicial authority is totally usurped. The report admits respondent is not yet rehabilitated but pursuant to the opinion of a named psychologist or a reasonable facsimile that he will or may be reinstated if the conditions set forth in the letter of July 27 are fulfilled on some unspecified date in the future. Thus the judgment compels College to conditionally reinstate respondent [161 Cal. App. 3d 748] irrespective of the obvious legal and financial burdens which may ensue.  We hold, however, that the facts detailed with respect to the specific literal charge and all its inherent innuendoes were overwhelmingly proved, and that procedural requirements for the hearing before the board and/or Commission were complied with in all respects. The Commission and the courts have a grave responsibility not alone to respondent but also to the appellants and their personnel, the professors, instructors and students they embrace, and to the general public.  The judgment is reversed. Superior court is directed to vacate its judgment and enter a new and different judgment dismissing respondent's petition. Costs to appellant.  Compton, J., and Gates, J., concurred.  FN 1. Education Code section 87031 states in part: ""Materials in personnel files of employees which may serve as a basis for affecting the status of their employment are to be made available for inspection of the person involved .... Information of a derogatory nature ... shall not be entered or filed unless and until the employee is given notice and an opportunity to review and comment thereon. An employee shall have the right to enter, and have attached to any such derogatory statement, his own comments thereon.""  FN 2. In Miller, the court actually discusses and interprets Education Code sections 44031 and 44664 which for all pragmatic purposes applies to this case to Education Code section 87031 and we so treat it.  FN 3. Additional references from the exhibits supporting the conclusion that respondent had notice of the derogatory materials are:  July 10, 1981, letter from Dean Haley to respondent.  October 20, 1977, ""Notice--Need for Work Improvement.""  April 6, 1981, letter from Dean Haley to respondent.  July 27, 1981, report of Dr. Levy.  July 13, 1978, letter from Dick Wohlgemuth to respondent.  April 26, 1981, report from Dr. Boylan to Dean Haley.  June 29, 1978, letter from respondent to ""Dick,"" and the hearing transcript, pages 24, 57, 61 and Wohlgemuth's testimony generally, pages 64, 114, 172-173.

                Seattle Times staff reporter
              

              
              A Shoreline Community College professor has resigned after the state Auditor's Office uncovered evidence that he violated state ethics laws and school policies by using his office computer to view pornographic movies, visit adult-oriented Web sites and conduct personal legal business.

A report issued this week by the state Auditor's Office alleges that James N. Jory, 59, a full-time, tenured professor and part-time attorney who taught business administration and international-studies courses at Shoreline from 1990 until his resignation Sept. 30, used a state-owned computer to view more than 70,000 ""graphic images and movies that contained adult-oriented material.""

The auditor's report also charges that at least one document and more than a dozen e-mails were found on the computer, all of which ""contained information related to the employee's outside work as an attorney.""

Jory declined to comment about the allegations.

""I'm not at liberty to discuss it,"" Jory said yesterday. ""I don't know what my future will be. I have no comment.""

State Auditor Brian Sonntag said the case demonstrates that unlawful use of state resources can and will be detected and rooted out.

""That was an awful lot of inappropriate use of a state computer,"" said Sonntag, who added, ""Any of those uses is illegal.""

This week, Jory's case was referred to the state Executive Ethics Board for possible disciplinary action. The board's next meeting is scheduled for early November.

Characterized by those who know him as a well-respected faculty member, Jory held the position of full professor and associate dean of Shoreline's business-administration division. Over the years, Jory taught a variety of courses, including Introductory Law and a class called E-Business, both of which have been canceled for the fall 2002 quarter. All substantive references to Jory have been removed from Shoreline's Web site.

Shoreline officials say Jory participated in at least three ethics-training courses since joining the school. In recent years, Jory was a member of an in-house committee at Shoreline that established school policies prohibiting use of computers and other state resources for private use, personal benefit or commercial gain.

Shoreline President Holly Moore said disclosure of Jory's suspected behavior stunned her and many of his former colleagues.

""This was a great shock and a big concern to the college,"" Moore said. ""It just seemed incongruous with the rest of his work over the course of his tenure. I don't think there's any way we could have anticipated this.""

Moore added that Shoreline will strengthen its ethics-training courses to impress upon its employees the importance of ethical behavior.

Jory had long been suspected of using state resources to conduct personal business, said some familiar with the case.

According to the auditor's report, however, the extent of Jory's alleged ethical lapses didn't come to light until December 2001, when he was seen by another Shoreline employee watching a pornographic video on his office computer. The report further states that Jory received a warning from the school at that time and agreed to ""cease the inappropriate use of the state computer.""

But seven months later, the report says, Jory had failed to curb his behavior, which prompted an unidentified whistle-blower to report the matter to the Auditor's Office. After releasing its report this week, the Auditor's Office referred the case to the state Executive Ethics Board, which has the authority to penalize state employees who violate ethics rules.

Recent history suggests that the board could still seek to punish Jory, though he is no longer a state employee.

In 1999 a state worker who downloaded more than 1,400 adult-oriented images to his state-owned computer was fined $3,000 after he resigned.

And in 1997, a state employee was fined $1,000 for sending personal e-mail using state equipment.

""It's not unusual"" for the board to pursue such cases, said Brian Malarky, executive director of the ethics board. ""It just depends on the significance of the amount of damage to state resources.""

https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13507798/smithsonian-sexual-harassment-investigation-nmnh-miguel-pinto-banned,"In June 2011, a visiting scientist at the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) lured a younger research student into an isolated hallway and groped her. Over the past five years, the student — whom we called by the pseudonym “Angie” in an extensive investigation of her case published last week — has fought a frustrating battle to get museum officials to protect her from her harasser, a bat researcher named Miguel Pinto.On November 1st, Angie was finally given the protection she sought. As of that date, the museum has banned Pinto from its laboratories and collections, ending his status as a “research collaborator” and deactivating his entry badge. Museum officials declined to explain their decision: in a terse statement to The Verge, NMNH communications chief Sarah Goforth said only that “Miguel Pinto is no longer affiliated with the Smithsonian.”The move is directly related to the harassment chargesBut sources at the museum say the move is directly related to the harassment charges, as well as similar allegations against Pinto that have surfaced more recently. These include his recent admission to The Verge of a 2008 harassment episode at Texas Tech University, where he did his masters studies, and allegations by another former student that Pinto had harassed her in 2010 and 2011. Those latter incidents allegedly took place while both that student and Pinto were graduate students at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) in New York City.Nancy Simmons, a bat expert at the AMNH who was Pinto’s co-advisor at the time, laments that she did not do more. “I wake up in the middle of the night wishing that I had known, that I had been more observant and proactive about Miguel Pinto and his behavior,” she says.Pinto did not respond to requests for comment. But Angie says the Smithsonian’s decision does not necessarily demonstrate that it is now serious about protecting women from harassment. “This shows that the Smithsonian will protect women from sexual predators only if publicly shamed into doing so,” she says. Indeed, earlier this week, Congresswoman Jackie Speier (D-CA) wrote to the Smithsonian to urge that it launch its own investigation of the case and closely examine its sexual misconduct policies.“Sexual harassment needs to end right now, period.”“We cannot change the past,” Simmons says, “but we can change the future. Sexual harassment needs to end right now, period.”Conrad Labandeira, a paleobiologist at the NMNH who has closely followed Angie’s case, praises the decision to ban Pinto. But he says that it “should have happened some time ago.” Labandeira says that Angie’s long struggle for justice illustrates the need to tackle sexual harassment on two levels. The first, he says, is that of the individual harasser. The second “is the institutional role, establishing a workplace that is free of harassment and other kinds of inequities.” The two approaches, Labandeira stresses, “have to be linked.”Not everyone sees the banning of Pinto as a happy ending, however. “I am very torn in this situation,” says one scientist who asked not to be identified. “The idea of whether Miguel can be reformed seems to have been lost in favor of pushes to repudiate him as a human being, beyond condemning his terrible behavior.”Pinto now has a research position in his home country of Ecuador, at the National Polytechnic School in Quito. Thus he would only have visited the NMNH on occasion. But scientists who know him say that being banned from the museum is likely to seriously affect his research. The NMNH, with 140,000 specimens, has the largest bat collection in the world."

“Professor Thomas is a cultured, talented and tenured professor … who has never been afforded an opportunity to establish the specious nature of the allegations against him, having been given no opportunity to defend himself,” Chris Suba, one of Thomas’ attorneys, said Wednesday. “In this silence, he has been castigated in the eyes of the university and within his community.”

The woman’s suit says she contacted Southern officials about Thomas but was told they needed more proof, so she returned to his office and recorded him saying, “do you want to cuddle for a C?” The woman claims she told him no, and as she walked away, Thomas said, referring to tuition, “your parents will have to pay all that money again.” Thomas also called the woman on her cellphone, a number she had not given him, and told her that grades were due and she needed to come by his office and “do what you gotta do before I give you a D.”

Thomas’ suit states that “these recordings appear to have been artificially altered as to change the import of what actually occurred.”

    Thomas' lawsuit against Southern, filed April 5, seeks monetary damages and has been assigned to state District Judge William Morvant.
    
    
    
The woman's suit against Thomas and Southern is before state District Judge Wilson Fields. It was filed in June 2016 and also seeks damages.Craft and Conrad said the woman will be graduating from Southern this year.

CHULA VISTA – Two Southwestern College administrators recently accused of sexual harassment have resigned, a college spokeswoman confirmed yesterday. 

The resignations of Greg Sandoval, vice president for student affairs, and Arthur Lopez, director of financial aid, have been accepted by college President Raj Chopra, according to the governing board agenda for Wednesday, which was released yesterday. 

If the board approves the resignations, they become effective Sept. 30.

Sandoval and Lopez could not be reached for comment.





 

Their resignations came three months after a student services assistant accused them of sexual harassment in a complaint to the state's Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

College spokeswoman Nevada Smith said Lopez's resignation letter stated that he was leaving for personal reasons.

Sandoval is leaving the college to dedicate himself full time to a doctoral program at San Diego State University, Smith said. Smith said Sandoval has had an “outstanding” career at the community college in Chula Vista.

The assistant, Martha Jimenez, stated in the complaint she filed that she had sex with Lopez to keep her job. She said that during their encounters Lopez would tell her to remember who got her the job at the college and that her performance evaluation was coming up.

Lopez's attorney denied the allegations on Thursday. 

Sandoval allegedly harassed Jimenez by having a picture of her in an evening gown as a screen saver and by asking her to read aloud a message from a fortune cookie and to add the words “in bed” at the end, according to her complaint.

She also accuses the men of sexual harassment in an administrative claim filed with the college last month. A claim must be filed before a lawsuit.

Lopez has been on paid administrative leave from his $118,000-a-year job since April. Lopez, 42, has worked at the college since 1987.

Sandoval, 54, has worked at the college since 1976 and has been a vice president for five years. He served as interim president for 5½ months last year. His salary is $150,072.

Jimenez accused a third administrator, director of outreach Fernando Poveda, of sexual harassment in both the state complaint and the administrative complaint.

Poveda yesterday denied any allegations against him, and said, “I will be fully exonerated and vindicated, and if possible, I will be pursuing slander charges against her (Jimenez).”

Poveda said he brought Jimenez's allegations of harassment to the attention of the college administration last summer, as soon as he became aware of them.

Both Poveda and Jimenez still work at the college.

Sandoval's resignation means that all four of the college's vice presidents have either resigned or been fired in the past 10 months.

“The decision that Greg has made was solely his decision and based on his desire to complete his Ph.D. program sooner,” Smith said. “He served the district for more than 30 years in a reputable manner, and we're really happy that he's exploring his future goals, and we wish him well.”

			Spaulding University psychologist James Cooksey suspended for violation with supervisee		 
	

	
		On March 7, 2011, the Commonwealth of Kentucky Board of Examiners in Psychology suspended James J. Cooksey for one year with nine months of the suspension probated for three years.
According to the Board’s Final Order, Cooksey was found to have exercised undue influence in such a manner as to exploit a student or supervisee and to have committed incompetence or negligence in the practice of psychology.
Specifically, the Board found that Cooksey engaged in inappropriate personal discussions with a supervisee, as well as inappropriate physical contact (a massage) with the supervisee, to gratify his own personal emotional needs.
Following his three-month suspension, he is not permitted to supervise any student or anyone providing psychological services and must be supervised in his own practice for at least two years by a Board-appointed psychologist supervisor.
He is also required to pay penalties to the Board totaling $1,250 for his violations and must also pay the Board its costs for the disciplinary proceedings against him.

http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2018/mar/16/allegations-of-coercion-raised-in-harassment-case-/," 
                Newly filed court records reveal details of sexual harassment allegations against Darren Pitcher, the former acting president of Spokane Falls Community College who resigned last month in the middle of a human resources investigation.
Among other things, Pitcher is accused of exposing himself to a coworker and coercing subordinates to have sex with him. Court records state that “those subordinates either gained promotion as a result of the sexual relationship or were fired or demoted if his sexual advances were rebuffed.”
The allegations are described in court records filed Friday by attorney Nicholas Kovarik, who is seeking to prevent the names of victims and witnesses from being disclosed in public records. The Spokesman-Review, the Inlander and KXLY each have requested records regarding the allegations against Pitcher, but the Community Colleges of Spokane has yet to fulfill those requests.
The injunction states that the human resources investigation began in mid-January, when one woman, referred to as Jane Doe No. 1, made a number of allegations against Pitcher. The injunction states that Pitcher exposed his genitals to the woman, groomed her for “a quid pro quo sexual encounter” and “engaged in inappropriate sexual intercourse with her,” causing her “extreme emotional distress, embarrassment and humiliation.”
At least eight other women gave interviews while the investigation was underway, according to the injunction filed by Kovarik.
“These individuals would not have given information or would have agreed to be interviewed had they known their names would be made public,” the injunction states. “They are all fearful of retaliation from other employees and the public at large.”
“Moreover, Jane Doe No. 9 was specifically targeted and was sent instant messenger messages of a sexual nature from Dr. Pitcher,” the injunction states. “Disclosure of her name and identifiers associated with these messages would be humiliating, embarrassing and would cause irreparable damage to her reputation.”
In a phone call Friday evening, Pitcher, 50, denied nearly all of the allegations, saying he had never had a sexual encounter with any of his colleagues, consensual or otherwise. 
“These allegations are slanderous and untrue,” he said. “When all the documents are released, that will become evident.”
Pitcher admitted only that he had made “unprofessional” remarks to one colleague in an instant-messaging conversation, which he described as friendly banter. He said he later apologized for those remarks, and the woman was receptive.
Pitcher said nearly 30 people were interviewed as part of the investigation into his alleged behavior, and he noted that no finding of guilt was ever reached. (The investigation ended when he submitted his resignation letter on Feb. 26.)
Pitcher joined SFCC in 2012 after more than a decade in leadership roles at another community college in Montana. In his resignation letter, he wrote that the past two years had been particularly difficult for him. He was SFCC’s vice president for student services, and last summer when President Janet Gullickson resigned, he took on the additional responsibilities of acting president.
“Although I have tried to perform at a high level, I have not taken care of myself and have not invested enough of myself towards my family life,” he wrote. “For the sake of my own well being I must submit my resignation effective immediately.”
Nancy Fair-Szofran, formerly the CCS provost, has served as SFCC’s president since Pitcher resigned. A nationwide search for a permanent president is underway.
CCS previously told The Spokesman-Review that the public records would be made available next Wednesday, but the injunction is likely to delay their release. The three news organizations are named as defendants in the lawsuit, as is CCS.
The district’s chancellor, Christine Johnson, who is in charge of the presidents at SFCC and Spokane Community College, was expected to speak Friday morning before Spokane County Commissioner Josh Kerns gave his State of County address. The audience was told Johnson could not attend due to “unforeseen issues.”
The Spokesman-Review and many other news organizations generally do not identify victims of alleged sexual harassment or sexual assault without their permission. The injunction would force CCS to redact names and other identifying information before releasing any records related to the investigation.
Kovarik, the attorney, wrote that disclosing the names of victims and witnesses would “cause a chilling effect for those coming forward to give information about workplace sexual harassment, retaliation and discrimination.”
Pitcher, meanwhile, said he was troubled by the effort to conceal the names of his accusers.
“I think I have a right, and the people have a right, to know who brought these allegations against me,” he said, adding that he believes one woman’s claims are particularly “far-fetched.”
“It’s destroyed my career and my life, and I think it’s only fair that she gets named as well,” he said.

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/03/15/how-st-olaf-scrubbed-building-name-revered-professor-accused-sexual-misconduct,"Sometimes the darkest and most brilliant aspects of a college's history are embodied in the same person, as St. Olaf College recently found out. The institution said this month that a campus arts building will no longer bear the name of a late professor of art and Norwegian who was a Nazi-era resistance fighter, following an investigation into “credible” allegations of his repeated sexual misconduct.
The professor’s family has criticized the decision, but St. Olaf’s faculty seems to back it.
“We live in a world in which two things that just don’t make any sense together can both be true at the same time,” David R. Anderson, St. Olaf’s president, said in an interview. “It’s confounding and disconcerting, and nevertheless you have to do the best you can to find a way forward.”
Revered Professor
Reidar Dittmann, who died in 2010, looms large in campus mythology. Born to Lutheran parents in Norway in 1922, Dittmann sympathized with Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany and was first arrested by occupying German forces for organizing the singing of anti-Nazi songs.
After a brief imprisonment, he joined the Norwegian resistance and helped sabotage a shipyard. His activities landed him a life sentence, and he became a political prisoner. Eventually, he spent 30 months in captivity in the concentration camp at Buchenwald.
“Above the gateway, emblazoned in brass letters, was the motto of the camp, and it said, ‘Right or wrong, my country,’” Dittmann said in a 1997 interview with Minnesota Public Radio.
Released in 1945, Dittmann emigrated to the U.S. and joined the St. Olaf faculty two years later. He co-founded the college’s international studies program and led students on annual tours abroad. He became the college’s first director of international studies and received the St. Olav's Medal from the Norwegian king in 1977 -- no small nod at a college founded by Norwegian immigrants. Dittmann also was a frequent lecturer on the Holocaust and took part in opening ceremonies for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.
After his retirement, in 2002, the college named the building that houses its art, art history and dance programs after Dittmann.
Allegations Surface
Cut to last year, when St. Olaf -- like many other institutions -- initiated a review of its politics and procedures surrounding sexual misconduct. The process involved creating an independent working group on Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, which prohibits gender discrimination in education, and gathering input from students, faculty and staff.
Several alumni came forward with reports of sexual misconduct involving faculty and staff members from up to decades ago. Some said they now felt comfortable sharing their experiences “after observing a change in St. Olaf’s culture,” according to information from the college.
An unspecified number of those reports centered on Dittmann. St. Olaf has released no detailed information about the nature of the claims against him, but Anderson said the accusers described behavior that “was wrong then and wrong now. This is not a question of 21st-century political correctness.”
The college investigated the claims, including through interviews with the alleged victims, and found what Anderson, the college's president, called “highly credible evidence” against Dittmann.
Carl Crosby Lehmann, general counsel for the college, was involved in the process. He declined in an interview to elaborate on the claims against Dittmann, citing promises of privacy to the alleged victims. But, in general, in any investigation, he said, it’s “significant” when multiple allegations from “individuals who don’t appear to have known each other come forward, and they’re saying, ‘I didn’t realize I wasn’t the only one.’”
Questioning the College
Last week, St. Olaf told people on campus and alumni about its decision to remove Dittmann's name from the building. Members of his family criticized the college, saying in a statement that they are “shocked and dismayed by the turn of events that has resulted in stripping his name from the Art and Dance Center at St. Olaf College. The allegations of sexual misconduct from decades ago deeply trouble his family, many members of whom proudly attended the college and grew up with it as an integral part of our lives. We abhor sexual misconduct without exception, but we are also devastated by the impossibility of due process for the person we knew and loved.”
There are “many other aspects of this case that should be disturbing to anyone who cares about civil liberties: the recklessness on the part of the college in allowing its alumni database to be used to distribute anonymous allegations and to solicit more allegations from a targeted group of alumnae; the college's secrecy about the allegations and the process used to indict our father posthumously; the haste with which the college reached its conclusion; and finally, the public humiliation our family is experiencing as a result of the college's communications of their actions,” the statement reads. “While we understand that the college needs to find a path forward, we are deeply saddened at this outcome, which provides no closure for us.”
Asked about due process for Dittmann, Crosby said that “when we receive allegations, we don’t take them at face value. We can’t ignore them, either, based on the fact that the accused person is not available to respond.”
Anderson said alumni have come forward with reports about late staff and faculty members beyond Dittmann, but his case has become public because of his significance on campus.
“It would be impossible to keep that name on the building” out of respect for victims, he said. “It was the right thing to do.”
Confronting the Past
Facing increased pressure to confront the darker parts of their legacies in recent years, institutions have responded in different ways.
Yale University, for example, last month announced that it would remove the name of John C. Calhoun, an alumnus who was the seventh U.S. vice president and an outspoken proponent of slavery, from a residential college (the decision reversed an earlier one to retain Calhoun’s name). Clemson University, meanwhile, decided to retain the name of a campus building honoring Benjamin Tillman, a notoriously racist politician who represented South Carolina through the early 20th century.
“Every great institution is built by imperfect craftsmen,” Clemson’s Board of Trustees said in a 2015 statement about their decision. “Stone by stone they add to the foundation so that over many, many generations, we get a variety of stones. And so it is with Clemson. Some of our historical stones are rough and even unpleasant to look at. But they are ours, and denying them as part of our history does not make them any less so.”
Some academics have argued against removing monuments that recall slavery or civil rights violations, saying it could amount to erasure instead of a teaching opportunity. Of course, at St. Olaf, the allegations are about the conduct of a professor against former students of the college.
Anderson said St. Olaf isn’t attempting to erase Dittmann, and that it “couldn’t, even if you wanted to, because of the remarkable 46 years of service he contributed to this college.” He underscored that that history of service doesn't “make sense” in light of the allegations against Dittmann, but said that “colleges and universities are human organizations made up of humans, and so they’re going exhibit the best and worst of us. Our greatest and weakest strengths are mirror sides of each other.”
In any case, Anderson said, “we are not seeking public approval and congratulations for being ‘such good people.’ It’s a sad day for the college that this actually needed to talked about, but we could not have taken the action that needed to be taken without public awareness of it.”
Shock, Sadness, Support
Anderson said he’s tracking the many responses he’s received on the matter from faculty, alumni and staff. There’s lots of shock, sadness, support and “thankfulness that the college did take this step,” he said, in that it’s “doubling down” on its values.
Kari Lie Dorer, chair of Norwegian studies at St. Olaf, used some of those words to describe the general reaction of the faculty, which was not involved in the decision; professors were briefed on the news a few hours before it went public. Though few professors still teaching knew Dittmann, she said, the faculty response was “first shocked and, second, thankful for how our administration dealt with the allegations from start to finish. … I do believe that our faculty trusts our administration in this decision.”
Nevertheless, Dorer said, Dittmann remains an “important part of my department's history,” and he's still remembered for his contributions to teaching and study abroad.
Anna Kuxhausen, chair of Russian and director of women’s and gender studies, congratulated Anderson on his leadership -- especially because the facts of the case will not be made public. That's consistent with Title IX procedures, she said, but surely problematic for some observers.
“The decision to rename this building is appropriate and courageous; it sends a strong message to survivors of sexual misconduct at St. Olaf that the college will not protect known perpetrators -- or their legacies,” Kuxhausen said via email. “Given [Anderson’s] statement, we can conclude that the allegations against Dittmann were substantiated to a degree that warranted this dramatic action.”
Asked what advice he might have for other institutions weighing aspects of their histories, light and dark, Anderson said, “You have to start by going back to the mission and stated values, and you have to behave according to them. That’s where the sadness and pain might come in. But, you know, we’re 142 years old, and I don’t think you’ll find many institutions that are 142 that don’t have complicated histories.”

University settles sex claims

STANFORD: University settles sex claims 
One professor retires, a second is demoted

Stanford University has settled two sexual harassment claims by demoting one faculty member and forcing a second into retirement, according to Stanford News Service.
Both claims involved the School of Medicine, which was also involved in two high-profile sexual harassment cases several years ago, prompting Stanford to implement a new policy of investigating sexual harassment complaints and protecting such victims from faculty retaliation.
Dr. Thomas Stamey has been removed from his position as chairman of the Department of Urology and has taken a permanent reduction in pay, in addition to contributing financially to the woman staff member who accused him of harassment.
Stamey agreed to the settlement but denied he had harassed the woman.
In the second case, Dr. Seymour Levine has retired from his position in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences. Levine was accused of harassment in 1993 by Helen Bae, a research assistant, who filed a claim with the university and a lawsuit. Both have been settled.
The financial settlement in the Levine case was not disclosed. Stanford President Gerhard Casper had earlier sent Levine a letter of censure.
Dr. Robert Cutler, an associate dean at the medical school, said Monday that he was pleased the cases had been settled. ""This sends a message about how seriously Stanford takes sexual harassment,"" Cutler said.
Stanford came under scrutiny when Dr. Frances Conley, a neurosurgeon, accused a departmental colleague in 1991 of a pattern of sexual harassment over the years.
That case prompted the formation of a new university policy on sexual harassment in 1993.
Dr. David Korn, the dean of the medical school at the time, said he was frustrated because it was difficult to change attitudes within the medical school.
In his letter of censure to Levine, Casper wrote, ""I am persuaded that you repeatedly hugged, kissed or touched Ms. Bae without her consent or encouragement.""
The civil suit filed against Levine by Bae has been settled as part of the agreement.
""Allegations of sexual harassment require careful, thorough and responsible investigation, and such investigations take time,"" Casper said in a statement. ""The full record and any sanctions must be weighed carefully.""

A confidential letter sent by Stanford to former graduate student Seo-Young Chu M.A. ’01 reveals new details about Chu’s public accusations of sexual assault and harassment against now-deceased English Professor Jay Fliegelman Ph.D. ’77.
The letter, which Chu shared with The Daily, indicates that then-Provost John Etchemendy Ph.D. ’82 personally oversaw a University investigation that found Fliegelman responsible for sexual harassment rather than sexual assault but also concluded that “Chu’s assent could be questioned” in an incident she reported as assault. Fliegelman was banned from campus for two years before returning to teach. 
Investigation summary  
The letter, signed Nov. 27 by Stanford General Counsel Debra Zumwalt J.D. ’79, was in response to Chu’s request earlier last month to see the report Stanford commissioned on her case in 2000. The University declined to send the full report, citing its standard practices, but provided Chu with a summary of the findings that led to Fliegelman’s suspension.
According to Zumwalt’s summary, Chu reported back in 2000 that Fliegelman “engaged in a continuing pattern of sexual talk and comments,” which included phone calls Chu found “unwelcome and disturbing.”
“He left me voice messages about overdosing on male enhancement pills,” Chu wrote in a creative nonfiction piece recently published in Entropy. “He shared explicit fantasies with me — despite my protests.”
Fliegelman called his sexual phone calls to Chu “playful banter” and described his explicit conversations with her similarly, the investigation summary says. Chu, on the other hand, said she felt pressured. 
According to the letter, Chu said she told Fliegelman that she was uncomfortable and wanted to leave before he initiated “oral-genital contact.”
The letter stated that the “physical sexual contact” occurred under “circumstances that were extremely inappropriate” and that Chu’s consent “could be questioned.” The investigation also drew on reports from third parties, who said that Chu had described the encounter as non-consensual around the time it happened. 
But there were no witnesses to the incident of oral-genital contact, Zumwalt wrote, and Fliegelman disputed that he persisted despite Chu’s verbal refusal.
Fliegelman was eventually found responsible for sexual harassment and professional misconduct – but not sexual assault, something Chu questioned in an email Tuesday to Zumwalt and administrators responding to the investigation summary. Chu, now a professor of English at CUNY Queens College, disputed Stanford’s account of the oral-genital incident.
“The ‘contact’ between his body and mine was more extensive than what the summary describes,” Chu wrote in her email. “Why isn’t the word ‘rape’ mentioned? He violated the place between my thighs with both his mouth and his genitalia. I unfortunately remember him shoving his body into mine. (I hate the fact that I had to type those words.)”
She also said she recalled Fliegelman making her “stroke” an antique pornographic book. Stanford’s summary mentioned Fliegelman reportedly compelling her to watch porn, something she wrote she did not remember.
According to Chu, Fliegelman encouraged her several times to touch rare books in “an emotional manner” as part of the process of reading and researching — something that particularly unsettled her when it involved him physically “guiding” her. 
“First his hands on mine, and then —  spontaneously, he assaulted my ear. My neck. Other parts of my body,” she wrote to The Daily, saying she didn’t resist out of “petrification.”
Chu said that Fliegelman was well aware of her psychological vulnerability at the time, having asked about scars on her wrists and arms. In 1999, she said, she was hospitalized after trying to commit suicide and was diagnosed as bipolar. 
Origins of investigation 
Chu’s first advisor at Stanford, Herbert Lindenberger, ultimately reported Fliegelman to the University, as first detailed in New Republic; Stanford hired an outside law firm to investigate.
Lindenberger told The Daily that his report was triggered by Fliegelman’s obvious anxiety that his sexual advances on Chu would be discovered by others. Lindenberger recalled being approached by Fliegelman after an oral exam with Chu went badly: Chu was 40 minutes late and unable to answer a single question. 
“He was evidently quite nervous — in fact, obviously scared of what I might do to him,” Lindenberger recalled. “Out of the blue he said to me that Seo-Young had told him she was a virgin and that she was attracted to women. It was clear that he was trying to ward off suspicions that anything sexual had transpired between them.”
Lindenberger said he immediately guessed that “something serious was happening” and called on two senior female professors to work with him and Chu on a “cease-and-desist” letter to Fliegelman. But another graduate student had notified the Dean of the Humanities and Sciences at that point, setting a formal investigation in motion instead, he said.
Convening a faculty advisory board to review the case would have required Chu’s participation in the hearing, Stanford spokesperson Lisa Lapin told The Daily. (The full hearing process with the advisory board would have required witnesses, attorneys and cross-examination of the victim.) 
Because no faculty board was gathered, Etchemendy made the decision on the case, suspending Fliegelman for two years without pay as recommended by the law firm and banning him from the department.
Terms of suspension 
During the suspension, Fliegelman was allowed access to Stanford libraries and continued to live in off-campus faculty housing he owned.
In an email to The Daily, Lindenberger wrote that Fliegelman was given an office in “a prefab building at the edge of campus” where he continued to advise dissertation students during his suspension. Lapin disputed that Fliegelman was provided an office.
“Yes, he continued to meet with [his advisees],” wrote Lindenberger. “They were dependent on his help and they would have felt lost if he hadn’t been made available to them. He was the only expert in the department specializing in the early-American literature.”
Zumwalt’s letter to Chu also mentions a “significant financial sanction” against Fliegelman. According to Lapin, Fleigelman took a pay cut on his return and estimated financial losses related to his punishment at $1 million.
Chu said Stanford “needs to make available the details” of the $1 million figure and added that while she does not want money from the University, she has lost both time and money as a result of Fliegelman’s abuse — “the medical costs alone have been staggering,” she said.
Stanford’s policy on sexual harassment at the time stated that individuals found in violation may be subject to penalties as severe as discharge or expulsion. According to Lapin, Fliegelman could not be dismissed except by a full advisory board process, per University policy on faculty termination in 1999. 
But Lindenberger recalled being told at the time that Fliegelman’s punishment was the most serious that Stanford had ever imposed in a harassment case.
The official censure of Fliegelman was not always echoed by other faculty. Lindenberger said that some of his colleagues believed that Chu “was to blame” for the incidents of harassment because of her initial enthusiasm for Fliegelman and eagerness to have him as an adviser. However, both Lindenberger and Chu said she was adamant that she was not interested in a sexual relationship from the first. 
According to Lindenberger, Fliegelman also had the sympathy of former professors who had known him since he began his Ph.D. at Stanford in the early 1970s — and who later hired and tenured him upon his graduation.
“His former teachers (of whom I was not one) loved him as a person and greatly admired him as a scholar and teacher,” Lindenberger wrote. “These colleagues had a hard time believing he could do the things he was accused of doing.”
But few, if any, of these colleagues knew Chu, then a first-year graduate student who was new to Stanford.
Chu says that Stanford English Chair Alex Woloch witnessed some of Fliegelman’s verbal and emotional abuse toward her; in an email to The Daily, she said Woloch was present when Fliegelman “berated” her for wearing thick glasses and joined Fliegelman in yelling at her. In an open letter posted on Facebook, she wondered why Woloch did not intervene.
Stanford spokesperson E.J. Miranda told the Mercury News on Woloch’s behalf that Woloch did not know of any sexual harassment on Fliegelman’s part until he learned of the investigation. 
“I have absolutely no memory of any conversation along these lines,” Woloch said in an email to The Daily, referencing Chu’s allegation that he saw Fliegelman berate her for her glasses. He strongly denied ever having joined Fliegelman in yelling at a student.
After the case
Lindenberger added that the English department chair of another university attempted to arrange a visiting professorship for Fliegelman because she “felt sorry” for him. Her efforts were cut short by protests from fellow women faculty, he said.
Lenora Warren, an assistant professor of English at Colgate University, recalled hearing rumors about Fliegelman’s misconduct when she visited Stanford as a prospective Ph.D. student in 2006. As a specialist in American and African American literature, she was directed toward Fliegelman and visited his house with other students to tour his library.
“They were still steering female graduate students toward him,” Warren said. “At the time I felt strange, mostly in the way that these rumors were out there, and feeling maybe pressure and knowing that Jay would have been the most appropriate person for me to work with at the time … and feeling that I [didn’t] know if I would have options if something happened.”
“It just was easier to take the rumors as true and not go there,” she said. She stayed at NYU.
New Republic’s article on Fliegelman quoted other women expressing unease about their interactions with Fliegelman. Dawn Coleman, whose dissertation was chaired by Fliegelman and Franco Moretti — a retired English professor also recently publicly accused of sexual assault — recalled repeated invitations to meet with Fliegelman for dinner at his house or restaurants during the professor’s ban.
“In retrospect, I cannot believe that I was not given a clear statement of the terms or reasons for his leave when I was one of the students most directly affected by it,” Coleman told New Republic.
After the Fliegelman case, Etchemendy “dramatically” strengthened Stanford’s policy on sexual misconduct, wrote Lapin. (Etchemendy was unavailable for comment at the time of writing, she said.) Modifications to the policy included an affirmative consent requirement as well as further restrictions even in cases where, unlike in Chu’s, all parties agree the interactions were consensual. In 2013, Stanford prohibited relationships between faculty members and graduate students in their departments; according to a blog post by Provost Persis Drell, faculty members found to violate the prohibition may be dismissed. 
Fliegelman himself remained heavily involved in steering graduate students through the job market for much of his career, volunteering to chair the job placement committee for years in a row, wrote a former graduate student in a tribute. 
He held a prominent place in academia through his death in 2007, when the Faculty Senate honored him with a customary memorial resolution praising him as a scholar and mentor. An American Studies award for undergraduate research, now discontinued, was named after him.
Today, his rare books collection and personal papers are housed in Stanford’s Special Collections.
Law professor Michele Dauber, a vocal critic of Stanford’s sexual assault policies, has called for the Faculty Senate to disavow its memorial to Fliegelman, laud Lindenberger for reporting him and apologize to Chu. She expressed particular disappointment in Etchemendy for joining in the resolution.
“What Fliegelman did was monstrous,” she said.  “In my opinion, he never should have been allowed to return to teaching and it is beyond outrageous that he was apparently put in charge of parts of graduate advising.”
Lapin wrote that memorial resolutions are not voted upon by the Faculty Senate, complicating an actual repeal of the original.
“It is the equivalent of an obituary in a newspaper,” Lapin wrote. 
Chu left the Ph.D. program at Stanford after completing her master’s degree. Lindenberger said Chu’s parents and a group of faculty suggested she seek psychological help and that she “managed well” in the following year. She taught in a private school in the area and applied to Harvard, where she completed her Ph.D. and moved on to her current position at Queens College.
“Everybody knew Fliegelman, but only a few, like me, had worked with Chu,” wrote Lindenberger of Stanford’s English department in 2001. “She has [since] established an enviable academic career.”
On Wednesday, several of Chu’s colleagues wrote an open letter to English Chair Woloch, addressing the University’s recent letter to Chu. Their response, spearheaded by Gloria Fisk — another English professor at Queens College, CUNY — urges the Stanford English department to “declare its solidarity” with Chu. 
As of Monday afternoon the message had gathered over 100 signatures from professors across institutions, including 18 from Stanford alumni and one from a visiting fellow at the Stanford Humanities Center. Fisk said she and her collaborators did not circulate the letter among Stanford professors because they “understand there is an internal conversation underway at the department already.”
“We wanted to add to that conversation from our position as colleagues in other institutions, elsewhere,” Fisk said.
Fisk sent the message to Woloch and various members of the University administration Monday.
“This is all to say that we see Stanford’s problems as our problems, too,” the letter reads. “Alongside you, we hope to build an institutional culture that protects the right and ability of all of its members to do the work we love.”

An earlier version of the article incorrectly stated that Fliegelman died in 2008, not 2007, and that the university that offered him a visiting professorship during his suspension was Princeton. In fact, Princeton offered him a position a year before the incidents with Chu; another major university, which Lindenberger chose not to name, was behind the attempted arrangement during Fliegelman’s suspension. Finally, the initial version of this article said that Woloch had no memory of the scene Chu described involving Fliegelman berating her; The Daily failed to include the specific allegation of yelling in its communication with Woloch and has updated the piece to contain his more categorical denial of yelling. The Daily regrets these errors.
This post has also been updated to clarify the timeline of the open letter organized by Fisk and to add additional information about it as of Monday. Finally, an update clarifies that Dauber called for a disavowal of Fliegelman’s memorial resolution, rather than a repeal, given the obstacles to the latter action.

https://www.stanforddaily.com/2021/07/09/stanford-removes-library-collection-brick/,"
Stanford on Tuesday moved to strip the name of deceased English professor Jay Fliegelman Ph.D. ’77, who was accused of sexual assault, from his namesake library collection. The renaming was prompted by four years of advocacy from alumni and law professor Michele Dauber. 
The decision comes as the University faces heightened scrutiny over how it has honored administrators and faculty members accused of sexual misconduct. 
Amid activism in May, Provost Persis Drell ordered the removal of a brick on campus that honored former assistant dean Keith Archuleta ’78, who was arrested and sentenced in 1992 for secretly videotaping women students as they undressed. 
Former graduate student Seo-Young Chu M.A. ’01 said she was sexually harassed and assaulted by Fliegelman, her dissertation advisor, while studying at Stanford.
As a graduate student, Chu said that she received phone calls detailing “explicit sexual fantasies” and accused Fliegelman of initiating unwanted sexual contact. Fliegelman at the time described the calls and conversations with Chu as “playful banter” and denied allegations of sexual contact. 
After another faculty member reported the allegation, Fliegelman was suspended for two years without pay in 2000 by then-provost John Etchemendy. An investigation led by Etchemendy found Fliegelman responsible for sexual harassment and professional misconduct, but not sexual assault. Fliegelman did not face criminal charges for his actions. 
Fliegelman retained access to University-sponsored housing and the libraries. He returned to his teaching position after his suspension ended in 2002.
“I’m angry that two decades after Jay Fliegelman was punished by his own university for what he did to me, I am still cleaning up the mess that he and Stanford created,” Chu said.
Stanford spokesperson E.J. Miranda wrote in a statement that “the university takes matters of sexual misconduct very seriously and we are pleased that we have been able to resolve this situation.”
The Fliegelman Collection, which had been stored in Green Library’s Special Collections, “no longer exists,” Miranda confirmed. The books in the collection will be temporarily unavailable until the process of removing the name is complete.
Following his death in 2007, Fliegelman was commemorated with a Faculty Senate memorial resolution and an undergraduate studies award — honors that some faculty members say should be rescinded. A year later, the University acquired the Fliegelman Collection, a selection of books in his personal library, for an undisclosed price.
Fliegelman was a renowned collector and the special collection included 258 volumes, some of which belonged to historical figures such as Charles Dickens, George Washington and John Quincy Adams. 
Dauber, a vocal critic of Stanford’s sexual assault policies, played a central role in facilitating the removal of the library collection and the brick.
“Regrettably, it took Stanford four long years to do the right thing during which I fear that Professor Chu was repeatedly re-traumatized by Stanford,” Dauber wrote in a statement. “Stanford evidently wanted to get its hands on Fliegelman’s valuable collection of books at a bargain price, and it was evidently willing to launder Fliegelman’s dirty reputation to get them.”
Dauber added that those involved in facilitating the acquisition of the collection “should be held accountable.” 
Chu criticized the University for its lack of transparency, which she said resulted in the burden being placed on herself and others to push for the renaming of the collection.
“Stanford creates traumatized alumni,” she said. “I continue to receive messages from other alumni who were violated by people in positions of power at Stanford.”
Archuleta brick removal
Although it took more than four years for the University to remove Fliegelman’s name from the collection after Chu’s initial request, action on the Archuleta brick was far more swift. 
After Dauber and comparative literature professor David Palumbo-Liu notified the provost of the brick on campus, Drell replied in an email several weeks later that Archuleta’s donation was returned and the brick was removed. 
The University “actively addressed this concern when it was brought to our attention,” Miranda wrote in a separate statement. Archuleta is prohibited from participating in future Stanford events, Miranda added.
Archuleta resigned his University post in 1992 after his arrest and was sentenced to four years of probation and community service for videotaping 11 women students as they undressed inside his campus apartment. He invited the women to his apartment under the pretense of a photo shoot for a poetry book, the police said at the time of his arrest.
A University official said at the time of Archuleta’s resignation that the former assistant dean’s contact with the Stanford community was “permanently severed.” Archuleta acknowledged that he would “never regain the trust of the community” and that the “damage is irreparable.” 
That was the case until two months ago, when a brick with Archuleta’s name appeared outside the Black Community Services Center. Archuleta was also reportedly spotted at recent Stanford Alumni Association events.
In an open letter to Archuleta in June, Rachel Hartshorn ’92, one of the women Archuleta indecently videotaped, wrote that he had “sexually violated” her. 
“You committed a sex crime, Keith,” she said in the letter. “So, would you please be straight with me all these years after sneakily videotaping me in my undies? Why didn’t you stay away?” 
Archuleta did not return a request for comment.
Both the brick and the library collection “are essentially part of the same story — victims of sexual misconduct coming forward years later to demand that Stanford stop honoring their perpetrators,” Dauber said.
This article has been updated to clarify that the University “actively addressed” concerns about the Archuleta brick, not the library collection.

Updated at 11 10 2011Click On Images To Enlarge      I've often wondered why a ""renowned scholar"" like Vahakn Dadrian no longer operates from a university base. His various biographies on Armenian sites state that he taught at the State University of New York Geneseo from 1970 to 1991, and that he had ""retired."" It sounded unusual that a man of around sixty years of age would have taken such an early retirement, even if he wanted to concentrate on his precious genocide, as some bios explained. (At Geneseo, the sociology professor evidently concentrated on teaching his slanted genocidal views with near exclusivity. It's not like he would have needed to depart such a prestigious university base in order to focus on his genocide; as the newspaper article below indicates, he was already immersed in his genocide.)    Thanks to an astute reader, the riddle has now been solved. The prosecuting professor has a skeleton in his closet, so appropriate given that so many of those 1.5 million skeletons of genocide victims can barely be found.    It turns out Vahakn Dadrian had not retired.    He was fired.   Dadrian fired from Geneseo    SUNY Geneseo Professor Fired; Sexual Harassment [Cited?]    By SUZETTE SEVANTE    Times Union    April 24, 1991    State University College at Geneseo has fired a sociology professor who was accused of sexually harassing female students, its president has disclosed.    Vahakn N. Dadrian, an internationally known expert on genocide, was fired after an arbitrator found him guilty of sexual harassment and supported the school's desire to dismiss him, said Carol Harter, SUNY Geneseo president. The action was announced yesterday.    The college suspended Dadrian with pay in September after a student complained of sexual harassment, Harter said. He last taught in spring 1990 and is now banned from the campus.    Dadrian could not be reached for comment.    Ronald Satryb, vice president for student services and staff relations, said the incident took place April 24, 1990.    He said Dadrian was alone in his classroom with a female student when she agreed to help him hang a banner.    Once the banner was up, Satryb said, Dadrian asked the woman some questions, told her she was beautiful, then grabbed her and kissed her.    Satryb said the unidentified student pulled away and alerted authorities. He aaid the scenario was similar to charges against Dadrian in 1981.    Dadrian had tenure, forcing the school to go through an extensive arbitration process.    The college arranged for a hearing after Dadrian protested efforts to dismiss him, Harter said. The arbitrator, from White Plains, found the complaints valid and said firing was appropriate because students had charged Dadrian with sexual harassment in the the past, she said.    Satryb said school administrators did not feel it appropriate to call in police.    The college first tried to fire Dadrian in 1981 after he was accused of sexually harassing five female students.    An arbitrator found Dadrian guilty of the charges but ruled that termination was too drastic. Dadrian was suspended without pay for a month, and returned to class.    ""He (the 1981 arbitrator) substituted suspension and submitted a letter that said no further incidents would be tolerated,"" Harter said.    After the 1981 hearing, about 600 people, including 100 faculty, signed petitions asking SUNY to investigate the case further to ""protect our students from further harassment by Professor Dadrian in the months and years to come.""    Some students in 1981 voiced support for Dadrian, and contended the professor's actions were the result of cultural differences. Dadrian is a native of Armenia.    The professor lectures on efforts to reduce or destroy ethnical or national groups—particularly in Armenia.    Includes reporting by Blair Claflin.      There are so many ironies with the above account.    Dadrian's 1990 sexual attack on his student occurred on April 24.    The date this article appeared was one year later, also on April 24.    April 24 is, of course, the genocide-obsessed Armenians' celebrated ""Date of Doom."" How poetically just that April 24 would become such a memorable date for Vahakn Dadrian.    (One would have thought that on April 24, Dadrian would have been wallowing in gloom and despair, in the remembrance of 1.5 million Armenians savagely killed by subhuman Turks. What a surprise that his jolly self would instead reach out for the nearest available wench and engage in slobbering over her.)    Vahakn Dadrian    Vahakn ""Valentino"" Dadrian    And here's another irony: in 1981, hundreds of people from the university hoped to do away with this predator in order to ""protect our students from further harassment by Professor Dadrian in the months and years to come."" Does that not bear an ominous overtone to the genocide scholars' mantra (misquoting George Santanya), regarding ""Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it""? Who knows how many girls there might have been in the decade following 1981, facing unwanted advances.    (No one says anything about the much more far-reaching and insidious brand of harassment, that comes with poisoning the minds of impressionable youngsters, with Dadrian's special propagandistic brand of hatred and racism. Over the years, how many students left his classroom, entrenched in the belief that Turks have a genetic predisposition to kill?)    But at least Dadrian exhibits consistency in his character. With his interviews, he comes across as so arrogant and haughty in attitude, that it's kind of in line that he'd have actually thought his female students would have received him as one hot lover.    A remarkable lesson is that given Dadrian's fame [or notoriety, based on whom one speaks with], there is not one indication on the Internet regarding this scandalous episode. Is that not a troubling indication in itself of the power of the Armenian Genocide industry, and its success in keeping things from the public that does not put this genocide in the prettiest light? (In this case, a matter that puts into question the character of one of the industry's greatest advocates, allowing us to better comprehend the ethical lapses in his scholarship.)    ADDENDUM, 5-07:    Albany Times Union (Albany, NY), April 25, 1991         GENESEO FIRES PROFESSOR FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT     (Local)    Byline: Associated Press    The State University College at Geneseo has dismissed a sociology professor for sexually harassing an 18-year-old freshman.    Vahank Dadrian, an internationally known expert on genocide, was notified of his discharge from the faculty by a letter Monday. The dismissal became effective Wednesday.    He had been suspended since September and had not taught at the college near Rochester since last spring, officials said.    Ronald Satryb, vice president for student services and staff relations, said the student filed a formal complaint against Dadrian about a year ago. The school investigated and found substance to the allegation, Satryb said.    The school offered the 64-year-old professor a chance to resign, but Dadrian appealed the decision, Satryb said. The matter was submitted to binding arbitration earlier this month.    Arbitrator Carol Wittenberg found that Dadrian had harassed a female student on April 24, 1990, the day the professor returned to the school from several international conferences on genocide.    According to the complaint, Dadrian kissed the student on the lips after she helped him rehang a banner welcoming him back to school. Dadrian contended that the two had hugged to celebrate the successful hanging of the banner, followed by a kiss on his cheek by the student.    In making her decision, Wittenberg noted that another arbitrator had found Dadrian guilty of four charges of sexual harassment in 1981, but had allowed him to return to the classroom because the arbitrator believed that ""Professor Dadrian had engaged in singular events that would not happen again.""    After the 1981 hearing, about 600 people, including 100 faculty, signed petitions asking SUNY administrators to investigate the case further to ""protect our students from further harassment by Professor Dadrian in the months and years to come.""    Some students in 1981 voiced support for Dadrian, and contended that the professor's actions were the result of cultural differences. Dadrian is a native of Armenia.         ""Fool Me Once, Shame on You. Fool Me Twice, Shame on Me.""    An adage lazy-thinking individuals would do well to remember the next time they consider accepting, at face value, the claims of Vahakn Dadrian... a liar.        Vahakn Dadrian, in his chapter of Editor Jay Winter's propaganda book America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915 (entitled ""The Armenian Genocide: an Interpretation""), where Dadrian threw in practically every weasel fact he has come up with in his long years of prosecutorial research, wrote:    In his post-war memoirs he {Halil Pasha, Enver's uncle} boasted of having killed altogether ""300,000 Armenians"" adding ""it can be more or less. I didn't count.""27 Given the relatively large numbers involved, and given the vicissitudes of war, this process of liquidation inevitably took several months to complete    [Footnote 27: Halil Pasa, Bitmeyen Savas;, ed. M. T. Sorgun (Istanbul: Yedigun, 1972), p. 274. On p. 241, Halil is more emphatic: ""I have endeavored to wipe out the Armenian nation to the last individual"" (""Son ferdine kadar yok etmege calistigim Ermeni milleti""). For more details, see Dadrian, ""Documentation of the Armenian Genocide in Turkish Sources,"" pp. 116-17.]    When I first came across this Dadrian claim in a source other than the above (naturally, the prosecutor has made use of his ""Halil card,"" repeating it in many of his other writings and speeches), I was taken aback. Could this be the ""smoking gun"" of genocidal proof, at last?    After all, finally, here is a high Ottoman officer admitting that he killed tons of Armenians! This is the kind of thing that is infinitely more valuable than all the Morgenthaus, Bryces, Lepsiuses, missionaries, New York Timeses and other agenda-ridden Turk-hostile parties put together. Why, this sounded like real evidence!    I had my suspicions, of course, and not just because the notoriously dishonest V.D. was behind this claim. As Mr. Spock might have put it, for simply one Ottoman mass murderer to have been behind the killings of so many Armenians would be ""highly illogical.""    We know up to 600,000 Armenians really died. (Again, Armenian extremists like Dadrian concede one million survived; subtracted from the pre-war population hovering around 1.5 million, according to most ""neutral""— that is, pro-Armenian and Western — sources, we get a good idea of the actual mortality.) An entire quarter of those were killed by starvation and disease, while accompanying the Russian retreats, as Hovannisian wrote in his 1967 book. That is, the Turks were nowhere in sight, and yet these 150,000-odd Armenians somehow became ""genocide victims."" The bulk of the 400,000 or so remainder also died of the same reasons, famine and disease, along with exposure and combat... while we can never be exactly certain, the ones who were massacred outright probably numbered in the low tens of thousands, at most.    So it didn't make sense for just one Turkish villain to have knocked off 300,000 Armenians. Why, even if we go with the Armenian Patriarch's inflated pre-war population figure (2.1 million. The truth-challenged Patriarch also went with 1,850,000, according to Johannes Lepsius' sworn testimony at the 1921 Tehlirian trial), of that number, only 840,000 Armenians were killed, as the Patriarch himself concluded at 1918's tail end. Subtract Hovannisian's 150,000 who died when the Turks were nowhere in sight, and are we to assume Halil Pasha would have succeeded in single-handedly rubbing out nearly an entire half of the exaggerated 690,000 remainder?    Another point that made me doubtful was that I couldn't understand why I had not come across this Halil Pasha ""confession"" at a much earlier stage of my genocide research. Why weren't Armenian genocide sites screaming this ""confession"" at the tops of their lungs? After all, here was, on the surface, the evidence they were looking for, for so very, very long. And why was Dadrian himself referring to this ""confession"" in a kind of ""by the way"" fashion?    The only way to find the answer lay with consulting the original book itself.    We know Mr. Dadrian is prone to make alterations, to serve his propagandistic agenda. Actually, it's not true to say ""we""; the prejudiced ""scholarly"" world has taken what Dadrian has been saying at face value, so only few are aware. But even some ""genocide scholars"" like Donald Bloxham and Hilmar Kaiser have begun to perform the unthinkable, and have been pointing fingers at Dadrian's lack of scholarly ethics. The latter, for example [in Journal of the Society for Armenian Studies, 9 (1996)], warned against Dadrian's penchant to make use of ""misleading quotations,"" which the Halil Pasha ""confessions"" will serve as a particularly deadly example of, as we'll be seeing in a moment.    It's easy to bust the deceitful Dadrian (ye olde English meaning of the obsolete verb ""didrian"": To Deceive) when he makes outright falsehoods such as ""Malta was not a venue for criminal trials but a temporary detention center,"" in order to throw the bloodhounds off his track. All one has to do, with this example of the Malta Tribunal, is to check the sources available in English, the British archives itself. (All of it, not just the selective ones Dadrian deceptively points to, in the service of his agenda.) But Dadrian also points to sources in other languages. The English-speaking researcher with limited resources is going to be at a loss, and has little choice but to accept Dadrian's ""word.""    Prof. Norman Stone wrote, ""Lewy... has the considerable merit of showing that Dadrian’s scholarship is itself full of holes — documents selectively quoted in pursuit of his thesis that the Armenian massacres can be put on the same level as the Holocaust. Since Lewy reads German as well as Dadrian does, he is in a very good position."" This is what makes Guenter Lewy and his book, The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman Turkey — A Disputed Genocide, so valuable. Like the genuine scholar Lewy is, Lewy did not simply take the word of Vahakn Dadrian, as so many amateurish historians or prejudiced ""genocide scholars"" have done. Lewy consulted the original German sources, and exposed, time and time again, Dadrian's ""willful mistranslations, selective quotations, and other serious violations of scholarly ethics"" (as Lewy summed up in his response to a highly abusive Peter Balakian, letters, Commentary Magazine).    At least German is more of an international language. Dadrian also knows Turkish, and that puts those who have no access to Turkish sources (along with the lack of familiarity with the language) in a tougher spot. This may be one reason why Dadrian appears lately to be concentrating on Turkish sources, knowing that hardly anyone will be looking over his shoulder, so he can escape with claiming whatever he feels he could get away with. I became particularly aware of this shortcoming, while dissecting Dadrian's smear attack on Erickson.    But the TAT site has been around for a while now, and I've begun to get letters from Turks in Turkey. So I wrote back to a few whose English was proficient enough, and asked whether they could dig up Halil Pasha's memoirs, ""Bitmeyen Savas"" (The Unending War). I give thanks to Damla Ozdemir, and especially to Serhan Altug, who located the book and took the trouble to translate the ""Armenian"" chapter (which will be presented after our analysis, below). A Turkish professor also cleared up what was behind the 300,000 killed ""confession,"" so I was fortunate to get the information from two different sources. (Thanks to Sukru Aya for translating what the professor wrote.)  300,000 Armenians Killed by Halil Pasha?    (The highlighted section below represents the pertinent passage from the book.)     Things spoken about Halil Bey are partly right, partly wrong. For one thing, Halil Bey uncle of Enver Pasa, when he was a convict at Bekiraga Army Barracks, is invited by a British Captain to the room of the camp director. Let us learn the rest by reading from his memoirs:    The British Captain says: ""You, Halil Pasa, are responsible for the deaths of three hundred thousand Armenians, fifty to sixty thousand Arabs, thirteen Jews, two British officers and a Turkish Corporal. What is your answer?""    I presume the British captain had forgotten to whom he was speaking; I had met too many similar persons. When introducing himself he had only mentioned his name and rank and had not mentioned on behalf of whom he was placing the questions. I was upset by his arrogant manners. I turned to the director and said:    ""Give me a pen and paper... Let me write down so that he can take it and go.    And I wrote:    1- 300.000 Armenians...can be less or more, I did not count. Wherever they revolted against my state, I supressed and punished them. Wherever their revolting was probable, I ordered local authorities for their relocation.    Dear Aya, As you can understand, Halil Pasa was angry about the placed question and gives a joking answer. He definitely did not say that he has killed or so. The incident takes place in 1919 and displays the behaviour against occupation forces, There is no other memory about the relocation and killing of Armenians in Halil Bey's memoirs. In reality he was not responsible for this matter during that period of time. He was an army commander in chief.    Regards - Kemal Cicek    (Let us bear in mind this was a private communication, written quickly and informally off the top of the professor's head, and the comments should not be taken as ""official."" The passage has been used with permission.)    [Here is the original, in Turkish]      Let's dispatch with other Halil Pasha ""evidence"" that Dadrian has provided, before moving on to the second ""confession"" of Halil Pasha.    Here's Dadrian at work. He came across a juicy tidbit from a high Ottoman general that could be manipulated into sounding like a confession for systematic extermination. In order to drive the nail into Halil's coffin, Dadrian feverishly looked for any other implicating materials regarding Halil Pasha, in order to make Halil Pasha out to be another Heinrich Himmler. It doesn't matter if these other references were tainted. The Turk confessed, didn't he? The supplementary materials must then be true as well, even if they derived from biased sources.    From ""The Armenian Genocide: an Interpretation,"" here is what preceded the devastating ""confession"":    Vahakn Dadrian    This practice of wholesale slaughter of Armenian conscripts was confirmed by Germany's Vice-Consul at Erzurum, Scheubner Richter, a Reserve Captain. In a 4 December 1916 report to Berlin, he declared that General Halil (Kut), the uncle of War Minister Enver, ordered ""the massacre of his Armenian . . . battalions.""[24] Halil's policy of extermination of the Armenian soldiers under his command is attested to by a Turkish officer who was part of his First Expeditionary Force (formerly the Fifth Expeditionary Force). As he stated, ""All of the Armenian officers and soldiers of our Force were massacred by the order of Halil Pasa."" The same officer continues to say that subsequently ""Halil had the entire Armenian population (men, women and children) in the areas of Bitlis, Mus, and Beyazit also massacred without pity. My company received a similar order. Many of the victims were buried alive in especially prepared ditches.""[25] A Russian-Armenian lawyer disclosed, in the Red Paper he compiled to expose, he said, the falsehoods of the White Paper the Ottoman authorities had published during the war, that ""upon orders of General Halil, 800 Armenian and another time 1,000 soldiers, officers, and MDs in his Expeditionary Force were disarmed and killed by the Turkish soldiers of that Force.""[26] Halil had been successively commanding several Ottoman Turkish army units, including the Fifth Expeditionary Force, the fifty-second Division, the Eighteenth Army Corps, the Sixth Army, and finally the Army Groups East.

For similar reports on the mass murder of disarmed Armenian labor battalion soldiers, see below, notes 69, 73, and 79, and corresponding texts, discussing reports made by the Austrian Trabzon Consul, a German Colonel in charge of a regiment comprising felons released from the prisons of the Ottoman Empire, and Trabzon's US Consul Heizer.    25 Report in Bureau de Correspondance Juif, The Hague, reproduced under the title, ""Les massacres d'Armenie d'apres un temoin oculaire"" in La [Vow] de I'Armenie (Paris, fortnightly) LVA 1:24 (15 December 1918), p. 901.    26 Gregory Tchalkhouchian, Le Livre rouge (Paris: Imprimerie Veradzenount, 1919), pp. 43-4. For a similar Armenian account see Garo Pasdermadjian, ""Armenia. A Leading Factor in the Winning of World War I,"" Armenian Review 17:1-65 (Spring, February 1964), pp. 29-30.]    Were Armenian labor battalion soldiers killed? Yes, they were. Nobody is saying crimes against Armenians were not committed. For example, Dadrian is fond of telling us General Vehib established a court martial and hanged the two major perpetrators of one such massacre. Ironically, this represents actual evidence against state-sponsored genocide, to give the highest punishment to rogue elements who went off on their own and committed crimes. By contrast, only one soldier was tried for the massacre of hundreds of Vietnamese civilians at My Lai, and his (Lt. Calley's) punishment, before a period of house arrest, was only three days' imprisonment. Hitler never punished SS men for abusing or killing Jews.    Kamuran Gurun had written in ""The Armenian File"" that the total number tried for crimes against Armenians was 1,397. Turkish researchers have updated that, via documents in their country's archives, with the following, as taken from the introduction of an upcoming book: ""[B]y mid-1916 the Ottoman Government had brought to justice 1673 people with claims of attacking the Armenian convoys and punished 67 of them with death penalty, 524 were jailed, 68 were exiled or similar, and 227 were found innocent. Out of the 1673 who were court-martialed 170 of them were government officials and 678 were soldiers. Amongst them were majors, commanders, lieutenants, gendarmeries, commanders, and police chiefs.""    Let's bear in mind no Armenians were tried for the slaughter of Turkish prisoners, as reported by Ohanus Appressian in ""Men Are Like That"" (p. 132):    In this movement we took with us three thousand Turkish soldiers who had been captured by the Russians and left on our hands when the Russians abandoned the struggle. During our retreat to Karaklis two thousand of these poor devils were cruelly put to death. I was sickened by the brutality displayed, but could not make any effective protest. Some, mercifully, were shot. Many of them were burned to death. The method employed was to put a quantity of straw into a hut, and then after crowding the hut with Turks, set fire to the straw. One thousand of these prisoners were spared because it was known in Europe that we had inherited a large number of them from the Russians, and that no doubt an accounting would have to be made for them some day. The thousand who were spared were later liberated, as we had no means of caring for prisoners. No doubt they again took up arms against us; so in a way the killing of the two thousand was justifiable.    Let's get back to the evidence condemning Halil Pasha.    The primary accuser is a German vice-consul. This is yet another example of ""hearsay evidence."" The diplomat was in his cozy office, and could not have possibly witnessed events such as the massacre of Armenian battalions. I wasn't there, you weren't there, and Vice-Consul Scheubner-Richter was not there. He got the information second-hand, probably either through missionaries, Armenians, or Christian-sympathizing Germans. He happened to be one of the latter himself, as we can learn through what the reams of Armenian propaganda have unearthed.    For example, he is on record for having written, “The Armenians of Turkey for all practical purposes have been exterminated.” As we’ve seen, even the Armenian Patriarch was in disagreement with that foolish conclusion. (The Patriarch revised his number of 1,260,000 surviving Ottoman-Armenians three years later, in a 1921 report provided to the British, attesting to 644,900 still living in what remained of the empire. This is not what an objective party would classify as ""extermination."") Scheubner-Richter also wrote: ""by July 15 (1915) almost all of the Armenians had been expelled from Erserum."" Yet, many Armenians lived in Erzurum during the Russian occupation that was to follow. (And Morgenthau himself stated large numbers of Armenians remained in almost every city, in a March 3, 1916 letter to Lord Bryce, as quoted by Vahan Cardashian. [The Armenian Review, Winter 1957, p. 107]) Dadrian himself has instructed that by 1916, ""the genocide had all but run its course."") Like other Christian-sympathizing Western consuls, Scheubner-Richter is not a reliable source.         One thing is sure: Armenian statements that almost all of the Erzurum Armenians were deported and killed are ridiculous. This is demonstrated by the fact that so many Armenians lived in Erzurum during the Russian occupation. When the Russians departed there were enough Armenians remaining in Erzurum or returning from Russian Armenia to create an army and attempt to run a government. If all the Erzurum Armenians were dead, where did those Armenians come from? It is absurd to think, and no one then or now has asserted, that these were Russian Armenians who had first come to Anatolia in 1916.    Justin McCarthy, The Destruction of Ottoman Erzurum by Armenians    But the German represents far more believability than the other ""evidence"" Dadrian presents. In Footnote 25, an unnamed Turkish officer is supposed to have made statements, as presented in an Armenian propaganda report? (Entitled, ""Les massacres d'Armenie..."" from a publication in an enemy nation, France. Is that supposed to comprise actual ""evidence""? Note the date is December 15, 1918, before the 1919-20 Ottoman kangaroo courts were established. [When the accused had guns pointed to their heads to come up with culprits, otherwise it would be curtains for the Turkish nation.] Since the war had ended a mere six weeks ago (Oct. 30, 1918, the Armistice of Mudros) and it would have taken time to investigate and publish this report, such an interview with this purported Turk would have likely taken place during wartime. Even if the account were true, what soldier would have made such statements detrimental to his country, especially while war was ongoing, to an enemy of his country? Particularly if the statements were related in such an obviously over-the-top fashion, every single man, woman, child killed in the most monstrous ways, made to order by an Armenian propagandist.)    The worst is yet to come in the following footnote, however, as we are expected to accept the ""word"" of an Armenian propagandist living in France. Can Dadrian embarrass himself further? (Of course he can. He follows up in Footnote 26 with the ""word"" of the notorious Dashnak terrorist and mass murderer, Armen Garo, the one who bore responsibility for ""burning hamlets and mercilessly putting to the knife all of the peaceful Mussulman villagers that fell into their hands,"" (Rafael de Nogales, ""Four Years Beneath the Crescent,"" 1926), along with a long list of other crimes from the Ottoman Bank takeover in 1896 to the running of the Nemesis hit squad organization during the early 1920s. (A caveat: the work listed might have been written by Garo's son, Hrand Pasdermedjian. However, it is doubtful the son would have used his modest dad's self-given nickname of ""Garo,"" which means ""hero."")    This is not to say Halil Pasha did not order the massacre of the unarmed Armenian soldiers under his command. But before people of conscience make accusations, particularly of high crimes, they must rely on genuine evidence; not hearsay. Since all Dadrian has to offer is hearsay, he feels no compunction in simply making things up, to support his precious genocide thesis... things like the appearance of Halil Pasha actually confessing.Halil Pasha's Other ""Confession""     Let's get to the second ""confession"" of Halil Pasha, from his memoirs. To refresh your memory:    On p. 241, Halil is more emphatic: ""I have endeavored to wipe out the Armenian nation to the last individual"" (""Son ferdine kadar yok etmege calistigim Ermeni milleti"").    Sounds bad, doesn't it?    Sure sounds bad on the surface, anyway. But as Greek-Cypriot with conscience, Antonis Angastiniyotis, wrote: If you want to find more than one reality, you need to constantly dig the soil until your hands are bloody.    But that kind of thinking would entail integrity, a concept that is apparently pure anathema to one such as Vahakn Dadrian.    Once again, context is important. And the context of the above comes from a speech made to cheering Armenians... in Armenia!    You can read about it in the chapter from the book, presented below. You can bet on one thing: Halil Pasha's meaning had nothing to do with the genocidal implication Vahakn Dadrian was hoping for his readers to swallow.    What can be said about Vahakn Dadrian? Fortunately, I don't always have to worry about being diplomatic, and beat around the bush with such terms as ""a lack of scholarly ethics.""    Let us call a spade a spade:    Vahakn Dadrian is a first-class liar.    What's more, his morality is at a shockingly low level. Dadrian is willfully employing his deceptive tactics, with the purpose of making people out to be murderers. Sure, Halil Pasha is dead and cannot defend himself. Does that excuse Dadrian from twisting whatever snippets of propaganda and hearsay he can find, in order to blacken the man's reputation?    Forget about what Dadrian has been committing against this one individual. The hateful prosecutor has been employing the very same tactics to blacken the honor and reputation of an entire nation and people. (A nation, not incidentally, that allowed his family to thrive, a family that ""largely survived the genocide."")    Of course, more and more parties are going to find out exactly what kind of a ""scholar"" Dadrian is, and his currently acclaimed reputation will one day be ruined. But the intriguing question to bear in mind is... what do we make of the countless ""scholars"" who have simple-mindedly and unquestioningly accepted the scholarship of Vahakn Dadrian at face value? What will happen to their reputations?The ""Armenian"" Chapter from Halil Pasha's Memoirs         ERIVAN    In the morning at 9.00 am, my train stopped in Asmiyetzen where it is not too far away from Erivan. Armenian governors and commanders were ready to meet me at the railway station. German General Von Kres also wanted to celebrate the Armenian government with me and that’s why his train has arrived at the same time with mine.    I was just leaving the train when the Chief of Tasnaksutyan [Dashnak] Assembly, Aram Pasha, who I met in Van and has become a friend of mine, entered the wagon. My old friend that Armenians call as Aram Pasha embraced me while he was crying.    “Welcome Halil welcome.” With those words he was trying to show his pleasure sincerely. We alighted from the train. Von Kres just did the same thing. We greeted each other and then with the presentation of Aram, I met with the Armenian governors. I had not known them before but they were getting used to knowing me. I was leaping forward to the middle of certain death again. I controlled my armpit where my gun is and I have no doubt that I could reach the other gun easily that is in my belt. Somehow I would find a way.    We had a journey about 2 and half kilometers from the railway station to Erivan. I took Aram to my car and Von Kres was in another one with the Armenian governors. While the car was moving, I saw Armenian soldiers that were positioned on both sides of the road.    “Long live Halil Pasha” They were on the display.    Aram was unsettled and suspicious. He spoke in a whisper to me.”I became Interior Minister two days ago but the ovens couldn’t meet the demand. Therefore, I got beaten and my body is ruined. If the troops that are loyal to the government weren’t on time to keep them away from me, I wouldn’t be in here. Because of starvation, the government has no authority over the folk. As a conclusion we placed loyal troops on the roads that we are going to pass and also the most loyal gangs to the government are located on the mountains that are around the city to protect you. To summarize, Halil Pasha, we are really in a bad position.""    In the city, a mansion for us and another one for Von Kres and his retinues were reserved. After we settled in the mansion, I was alone for a moment. I told my retinues what they would need to do if there would be any clash. In any Armenian attack, we would fight till we have one person left alive.    A little later, protocol visits started. Gently, we visited the Armenian Prime Minister in the office of President with Von Kres and celebrated them because of their new, independent government. As we decided with Von Kres before, at night we would return to Gümrü and Von Kres would move to Tiflis using the same route with us that passes from Gümrü.    We asked them for their permission to leave politely. They spoke in Armenian between each other, then Aram Pasha started to talk.    “General Von Kres can abide by his program but we are from the East and according to those Eastern habits we can not let Halil Pasha go before he would be our guest at least for one or two nights.”    “Aram Pasha, I have to leave too.”    “I can not let you go Halil Pasha before we put you up at least for one night.”    As other Armenians were too insistent, I had no choice but to stay the night here. Afterwards, we went to the railway station all together to see Von Kres off. Before his train departed, he couldn’t keep himself from saying that:    “I am astonished to see in one day you fascinated the Armenians that we were trying to please for a month. As an ally of yours, I am proud with that situation.    I only answered with a smile.    Actually, to bind Armenians to themselves as they have directly bound Georgians, Germans made every sort of promises to Armenians and offered them money and aircraft. Their desire was keeping old grudges against the Turks alive. At such times, Germans had to act in that way to secure their economical and political gains.    We saw Von Kres off and returned to the city. Night was coming. A big dining table was laid in the green garden of municipality. Before the dinner, bottles of raki and wine were opened. While we were proposing a toast, we heard the sounds of guns going off. My retinues were restless; their hands were on their guns waiting for my order. We were ready about what we were going to if there would be any backstab on us. While the sounds of blowing guns were stopping and restarting, Armenian cavaliers were sent to those places where the sounds were coming from. That detachment was at the command of War Minister Nazarberkof. The man giving the orders was General Nazarberkof that was the Russian general defending the brows of Hay when I entered to Iran with Kuvve-i Seferiye. We used to be the enemy before, but in one night we became friends.    Hours passed in the night and everyone was going to be in their beds soon.    “Pasha, tomorrow visiting the Katagisos, the biggest spiritual leader of Armenians, would be a worthy attitude, would you accept it?” Aram said.    The next midday we would visit the spiritual leader in the Church of Asmetziyen.    Till the morning we didn’t have a comfortable sleep. In the early hours of the morning, the hum of voices started to come from the outside. At that moment there was a knock on the door and one of the assistants entered the room with a worried frown.    “Good morning Pasha, could you look outside, your orders…” The assistant said.    I moved to the window. There were thousands of Armenians in the square.    “Tell my friends to wait for my instructions and to be ready for anything. Don’t act or do anything out of my orders.”    Anything could have happened but I decided to walk through the paths of dead again and whenever I decided it before, I was feeling some relief inside me. After I was dressed and checked my guns, they reported that Aram Pasha had arrived. I found him a little thrilled.    “Could you make a speech addressed to the Armenian folk?” Aram asked.    I went out and gave the speech. My assistant Selahaddin had recorded the situation and his notes were as follows.    “At the end of September, 1918 we went to Erivan for the negotiations with the Armenians. There were negotiations there. There was a square in front of the building that we were staying at and about fifty to sixty thousand Armenian were gathered, calling Halil Pasha’s name. Aram, who was the Interior Minister of the Armenian Government, propsed for Halil Pasha to make a speech to the Armenian folk. Halil Pasha accepted the offer but I was suspicious. Since the crowd was composed of Armenians who were taken out of the country and almost all of their families had died or were wounded, they all were living for vengeance and seeing Halil Pasha as the man responsible for the deaths. Certainly the folk that believes they suffered cruelties can do anything to the man perceived as the heartless one. Especially on that subject, Armenians were bloodthirsty. Perhaps, precautions were taken by the government but the precautions that were taken by the government couldn’t prevent people from doing any bad thing if they wanted to do. When we got out of the door to reach the chair that was placed among the folk, we heard a scream but we weren’t sure about the cause. Aram was leading the group, and we were following behind him. Hereafter, I didn’t hope to return alive from there but by the way I was thinking about how we could save our honour, show them we have the courage to talk in front of them and we doubtless would do that. I was with Halil Pasha and whenever he reaches his gun that will cost the attackers. I was watching everything carefully. When he reached the chair, people reacted with a flood of applause and Halil Pasha started his speech, addressing them as follows.    “The Armenian folk that cooperated to dethrone a cruel, heartless sultan and to set up a free and happy country.""    ""The Armenian folk that I tried to kill to the last person since they tried to enslave a nation to the enemy in the most terrible and painful days of my country, the Armenian folk that I am offering peace, comfort since they take refuge of the Turkish nation’s high mind… If you stick together with the Turkish homeland, I would do whatever I can for your country but if you obey some group of unconscientious Armenians who would betray the Turks and their homeland again, I will give an order to the armies that are surrounding your country to not leave any Armenians still breathing on the earth. Be more reasonable.""         [The original Turkish]The above speech is where Dadrian derived what he termed an emphatic Hall Pasha's ""confession"" for systematic extermination. The translation is not polished in style, and aims strictly to provide a literal counterpart to the original sentences in Turkish. Thus, ""the Armenian folk that I tried to kill to the last person since they tried to enslave a nation to the enemy in the most terrible and painful days of my country"" became Dadrian's simple and genocidal ""I have endeavored to wipe out the Armenian nation to the last individual.""Is Dadrian correct to have highlighted this damning segment, and leaving the rest out? After all, Halil did say that he endeavored to get rid of the Armenians.I am reminded of Sir Charles Eliot's observation regarding foreign influence upon Ottoman-Armenians (Turkey in Europe): ""'Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war,' in English is a harmless hymn, suggestive of nothing worse than a mildly ritualistic procession; but I confess that the same words literally rendered into Turkish do sound like an appeal to Christians to rise up against their Mohammedan masters.""Similarly, the context in which Halil Pasha made his statement had nothing to do with a ""Final Solution."" What he was trying to convey was that ""the Armenians fought by the side of the Allies on all fronts"" and were ""belligerents de facto, since they indignantly refused to side with Turkey,"" as Armenian leader Boghos Nubar flatly admitted. Halil Pasha was a soldier; the Armenians had betrayed his country. It is the duty of a soldier to kill enemies who are trying to kill off his country. And he is expressing his sentiments in a ""culturally dramatic"" tone that may be misinterpreted in the West, along the lines of Eliot's ""Onward, Christian soldiers"" example.The once Ottoman-Armenians who were part of that audience knew what Halil Pasha was talking about. They knew the only reason why they were in this mess was because of the madness of their greedy and bloodthirsty Dashnak leaders, as Prime Minister Hovhannes Katchaznouni admitted in 1923 as a ""terrible fact."" It was these awful, corrupt leaders who were misgoverning them, leading them to three wars that they declared or provoked when the young Armenian nation should have been concentrating on getting her bearings, and who were causing the people's starvation through the leaders' corruption and neglect. (As Richard Hovannisian outlined in his history, prompting Sam Weems to conclude, ""The real Armenian genocide was caused by the Armenian peoples' 'own dictator leaders.'"" Hovannisian: ""In 1919, for each 1000 persons in Armenia there were 8.7 births and 204.2 deaths, a net loss of 195.5. It was verily a land of death."") This is precisely why in Halil Pasha's memoirs, we learn how precarious the position of the Dashnak government was, when beaten-up Interior Minister Aram Pasha whispered, ""Because of starvation, the government has no authority over the folk."")These Ottoman-Armenians in the audience likely had tears in their eyes, remembering the wonderful times they used to enjoy, when the wealthier ones were masters of Ottoman society... before their crazy leaders screwed everything up for them. Certainly, Armenian propaganda tells us it was all the Turks' fault — it's always the Turks' fault — but at that time, the Armenians knew better, and conditions were too grim to give priority to their propaganda. They knew the truth!So they met Halil Pasha's ""confession"" of wiping out the Armenian nation to the last individual with applause! Of course; they knew that they had fired the first shot, and it was Halil's soldierly duty to do onto the enemies of his nation before they did onto his nation. How could they argue with the truth? (Even ""today,"" an isolated Armenian of integrity can be found who points to this truth. ADDENDUM: How Armenians warmly greeted the Turkish army may also be determined by the report of this Armenian officer.)The Armenians did not interpret Halil's words as an admission for a ""Final Solution,"" and that he was talking about slaughtering innocent Armenian women and children. They knew that is not what Halil Pasha meant, the same thing as the Andonian concocted words that were stuck into Ottoman leaders' mouths, to the effect of ""kill every last Armenian man, woman and child without mercy."" What is the final proof of this statement's not being a ""genocidal confession""? It's the fact that Halil Pasha lived to tell his tale. Imagine a Nazi giving a speech in the newly formed Israel by the end of the 1940s, stating that he tried to eliminate every single Jew. The Nazi would have been lynched.    ""Return to your villages, homes and your families. Work for their happiness, time will erase the wounds of the present and the past.""    After the speech that I kept notes from, the crowd replied with a flood of applause again and we returned to the building that we were staying in. Early in the next morning we moved from Erivan to Gümrü. As I asked Halil Pasha how he could go into the crowd without fear and make such a sharp, sorrowful speech to the Armenians, he replied that declining the offer of Aram would be cowardice; after accepting the offer and then behaving in a cowardly manner would be disrespectful to the heroic spirit of the Turks.    “I didn’t consider returning alive from that chair but I chose an honorable death instead of a cowardly living.”    “My Pasha, I would like to live those noble moments with you once more.”    “Selahaddin, dying instead of living despicably is the only expression of the one thousand year history of the Turks.” I agreed with him and I was feeling a deep respect toward him.”    The speech was done but the danger had still existed. According to the program that was prepared by the Armenian government, we started to move ahead of the Hazmiyetse Church that had a three-to-four thousand year history.    Soldiers were still holding both sides of the road and beyond them there were a lot of Armenians in their crates and in the church square. Most of them had a miserable appearance due to the starvation caused by the immigrations. This bad scene left tragic impression on my emotions as it would have on everybody but the truth and main reason for being in such a bad position is the Armenians that tried to lay low an empire and covet the domain of the Turkish government, wealth of the Turks instead of a life full with comfort and earning. If my own citizens had tried to destroy my kingdom, I wouldn’t hesitate to act in the same way. In fact, we weren’t hesitating to send our own friends to their providential fates. An empire can not accept a betrayal or negligence.    Finally, we arrived to the church and as we entered the big saloon of Katagisos, the spiritual leader was waiting in his dressing uniform.    Firstly, I saluted him as a soldier, then sincerely kissed the hands of that long bearded, ruddy- cheeked, healthy despite his age, respected elder. He also kissed my cheeks; his eyes were filled with tears.    Katagisos was speaking the Turkish language with the Caucasian dialect. Once we didn’t understand each other, Karabet Ayiciyan were interpreting. Ayiciyan was one of the Armenians had received his law education in Istanbul. After his education, he had become a judicial inspector in Van. During the anarchy in Van, he escaped to Erivan. Katagisos invited us to the dining table after the conversation. Meat, pilaf and wine were put on the dining table. As we were eating and drinking, Katagisos found a chance and started to talk.    “My son, my Halil Pasha we are finding something to eat in order to survive with the kindness of God but the condition of the scattered people on the roads is so miserable. I am wondering if any aid from your side is possible.”    I turned to my staff president Basri who was sitting on the right of me.    “What is the reserve stored food of 9th Army?” I asked.    Basri opened his small notebook, looked at one page of it and gave it to me secretly. According to the records in the book, the food storage can meet the demand of the 9th and 3rd Armies at least for 3 years and the product of the year had been harvesting at the same time. That means sharing one or two tons of wheat with the Armenians wouldn’t make a difference for our armies.    “Give me a paper.” Halil Pasha said.    Armenians that are sitting on the table were waiting with a hope with their eyes wide open. I started to write.    “To the General of the 9th Army Sevki Pasha,    Two hundred tons of cereal will be sent to Hasmiyetze Station immediately and will be delivered to the Armenian government. Without losing time, beginning the transportation is a necessity. -- Halil “    “Send this telegraph; tell them to post it immediately.”    A hand reached and took the telegraph, a man read it and stood up and gave it happily to an Armenian cavalier. As the Armenian cavaliers and the other cavaliers sided with him were galloping to the telegraph office, the guns were fired. People were acting as if they were in a big festival and besides those entire noises the spiritual leader Katagisos was crying. The feast had been ended.    When we were returning to our mansion in the city, the people were applauding madly and showing their delight. Hungry people forgot their hatred, probably I wanted to let them know that the Turkish government can be merciless against the people whom betrayed itself but even they were the enemies, The Turkish government is so pitiful to people who are demanding food and calling for aid. We had seen a lot of Turkish warriors who threw their canteens to the enemy soldiers from their trenches.    Judicial Inspector Karabet Ayiciyan that I have known since the days I had been the gendarme commander in Van, came and started to talk.    “My Pasha, I couldn’t hear from my family since I left Istanbul three years ago. I wonder if you can help me…” I desired to ask why he left Istanbul and decided to betray his country with joining Armenian terrorists in spite of being a Judicial Inspector but I didn’t want to offend him. Also I sent this telegraph to Istanbul.    “From my account, but without talking about me, pay fifty pieces of gold to Ayiciyan family living in Bakirköy Zeytinlik, Istanbul. Besides pay one hundred Liras each month and inform them that Karabet Ayiciyan is alive and healthy in Erivan.”    Istanbul Central Commandership replied immediately and informed me that the order was done and the family was alive and healthy. When Karabet Ayiciyan heard the news, he beamed to me.    “How could you be such a good person Halil Pasha?” he asked and he went out in a hurry. I was watching as I remained behind. He saw his friend and started to explain something excitedly. I couldn’t understand what he said but I could imagine. On pg. 213 of these memoirs, we also have this statement by Halil::"" ... [T]here were thousands of Armenians who, through starvation, became misarable and wretched due to the migration. Like anybody else, this bad sight had left a painful mark on my feelings...""( ...MUHACERET SEBEBIYLE acliktan sefil ve perisan olmus binlerce Ermeni bulunuyordu. Bu kotu manazara, her gorende oldugu gibi benim de insanlik duygularim uzerinde aci bir iz birakti... )(Thanks to Hector; Addendum, March, 2007)    Is it possible that Halil Pasha was making himself out to be too much of a saint? Well, everyone has an ego, and it does sound like there was a little whitewashing involved.    His claims, however, are believable, in line as they are with historic Turkish generosity, tolerance and forgiveness. Look at what this ""Eichmann"" did: He performed a personal favor for Karabet Ayijian, as much as he resented the fact that Ayijian betrayed his country, the country that had treated him well enough for Ayijian to have built up a huge bank account. (Say! I thought the Turks were supposed to have stolen the wealth of the Armenians; I wonder why Ayijian's account was still intact.) More importantly, when Halil Pasha's country was in the throes of famine, he diverted food to alleviate the suffering of the starving Armenians. If there was diverting to do, he could have chosen to divert this precious surplus to the starving people of his own devastated nation.    Halil Pasha, often identified as the uncle of Enver Pasha (the reason: Enver was one of the ""Evil Triumvirate,"" thus his relative must have also been guilty by association, and similarly evil; another maligned relative was Enver’s brother-in-law, Jevdet Bey, the governor of Van, whom Armenian propaganda states nailed horseshoes onto Armenian feet) emerges as a soldier, a patriot and a man of honor. A far cry from the monster that Dadrian and his fellow propagandists have tried to paint him as.    Naturally, it is the duty of Armenian propaganda to portray the Turks as subhuman, comic book villains, and to smear any non-Turk exhibiting the audacity to treat Turks with a little fairness... such as the great American, Admiral Mark Bristol. In his paper detailing how the Tweedledee to Dadrian's Tweedledum, Prof. Richard Hovannisian, is also basically a ""liar,"" Prof. Heath Lowry wrote that Bristol had paid several historic visits to Armenia, holding meetings with President Khatisian, which Hovannisian had ignored in his history books, at least until that time. Lowry asked, ""How then do we account for Hovannisian’s silence in regard to this important event in this crucial period of the Republic’s history? I would submit... that it stems from an obvious Iack of objectivity in his approach."" (If Hovannisian paid note, in other words, he would have had — for one thing — to admit Bristol was not the ""Turcophile"" that propagandists charge Bristol as being, in an effort to discredit him.)    Similarly, what do we make of the fact that Dadrian completely ignored the details of this historic visit of an important Turkish commander, to the newly created state of Armenia? (Do not be surprised if other Armenian ""historians"" such as Richard Hovannisian similarly ignored the episode, which must clearly be documented in the Armenian archives and other sources.) These unscrupulous ""scholars"" will do anything to try and hide information going against their genocide thesis. The fact that Halil Pasha was greeted with applause, the fact that Halil Pasha demonstrated compassion for the Armenians... these are lethal examples of information for propagandists concerned with showing that the Turks were and still are all little Hitlers.    That is why Vahakn Dadrian made absolutely no mention of the details of Halil's ""Erivan"" chapter, nothing to brush aside in the history of the new nation's development phase. Dadrian only singled out parts of two sentences, taken way out of context, to demonstrate the evilness of Halil Pasha. Dadrian engaged in this ""scholarly technique"" deliberately, since he obviously read the entire book.    Is this hateful man simply immoral, or is he amoral? Does he know the difference between right and wrong? Only Dadrian knows the answer in his charcoal heart, of course. The more relevant question, as posed before, is: why do so many ""scholars"" pay attention and keep paying attention to this highly dishonest source?© HoldwaterThe source site of this article gets revised often, as betterinformation comes along.

                                PLATTSBURGH — SUNY Plattsburgh has terminated the employment of Dr. J.W. Wiley, and the former chief diversity officer has accused the school of racial and sexual discrimination.He filed the claim in April to the New York State Department of Human Rights and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission after he was assigned to work off campus on a diversity plan, during what he called an ""inappropriate-conduct investigation"" that began March 8.Wiley's charge of discrimination says the college removed him from the campus for ""the protection of the campus community.""
        ""I am aware of Caucasian males who have been charged with sexual harassment and sexual misconduct, but none have been reassigned to work off campus,"" his charge of discrimination says.""I believe my reassignment, particularly compared to colleagues and peers who have been investigated but not reassigned, is a result of being an African-American male and pejorative sexual stereotypes relating to the same.""CENTER CONTINUESAs of June 22, Wiley was no longer employed at SUNY Plattsburgh, Executive Director of Communications and Public Affairs Ken Knelly confirmed.Knelly said the college will appoint a new chief diversity officer in the near future.""The Center for Diversity, Pluralism and Inclusion will continue to operate,"" he said.""It currently reports to the Office of the Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs.""  LEGAL ACTIONSaying he is innocent of any accusations of sexual harassment or misconduct with students, Wiley said his charge of discrimination is only the beginning of legal action against the college.""(The charge of discrimination) is the document we need to file to get in the game,"" he said.He created a gofundme page called ""An 'Academic Lynching' Legal Support,"" with a goal of raising $75,000 for legal fees.As of Friday evening, 67 donors over 22 days had contributed $7,347.'NO CLUE'The allegation against the professor began 14 years ago, he said, when an ex-student and former teaching assistant considered pressing sexual-harassment charges against him. ""She said I tried to hug her — that's the furthest assertion she made,"" Wiley said.""Everything else was things she claimed I said to her.""Wiley said he did not have inappropriate relations with or sexually harass the student. The professor said he suspected his former student was bothered by two B grades — after two A grades he had given her in previous semesters.""I couldn't think of anything else, because I know I didn't do anything,"" he said.""Maybe she felt powerless, because she felt she got grades she didn't deserve — that could've been settled through a meeting with the dean.""""She also might have been going through something that I have no clue about.""  CONTROVERSIAL CLIPIn 2010, Wiley said talk of his alleged misconduct arose again when he showed a controversial clip from the movie ""Storytelling"" during his Romance, Sex, Love and Marriage course at the college. The clip showed a white, female graduate student having sex with her black professor, but whether the encounter was consensual was left to student interpretation. ""The purpose of it (the clip) is to show the intersectionality and the complexity of race and gender, power — all of that,"" Wiley said.""It's a clip to get us into conversation about rape and how we see rape, and do we see rape differently because of our racial experiences and biases?""On some level, I showed the clip so that we could have all of that conversation and get all of that context.""Wiley said he had screened the clip in his courses for several previous semesters.  ""Historically, the class was always very divided in their opinions of whether or not it was a case of rape,"" Wiley said in a recent email to some SUNY Plattsburgh colleagues.This particular year, Wiley said, one student advocated a non-rape perspective.""(And then) the young man behind him yelled out, 'If you don't think that was rape, you're an idiot,'"" Wiley said.Wiley said he reprimanded the student who had yelled for speaking that way in his class.The young man he reprimanded and another student filed a complaint against him, he said.Wiley said the complaint reads: ""The fact that our male professor finds no fault with the coercive actions of the professor in the clip from 'Storytelling' forces us to question whether he may find fault with pressuring his current female students to have sex with him.""OTHER INCIDENTSWiley referenced some incidents that he said happened over the years that make him believe the Gender  Women Studies Department and the Title IX office, an organization that works to prevent sexual discrimination at SUNY Plattsburgh, have aided in spreading talk of his alleged misconduct.Following the upset over the ""Storytelling"" clip in 2010, a Gender  Women Studies professor showed the controversial clip to a class of her own and led a discussion centered around Wiley's decision to show it to his class, he said.""There was no collegial exchange or announcement of this screening of my clip in her class for their discussion of my decision,"" Wiley said in a 2010 email to SUNY Plattsburgh President John Ettling.
        

""From what I understand, it amounted to a public lynching without me present to wear the noose.""CAMPUS UPSETIn February of this year, a friend and former employee informed Wiley of inquiries she received from a Title IX intern, he said.""She (the intern) approached my ex-employee and said, 'Has Dr. Wiley ever sexually harassed you or been sexually inappropriate with you?'""Those were, from what I understand, the exact two questions asked,"" Wiley said.The intern told Wiley's former employee that she was performing research, he said, but Wiley considers the incident an ""unsanctioned investigation.""The Title IX intern was the professor's former student and had previously asked him for a letter of reference, Wiley said.""I suspect she began the investigation because of her discovery of the rumor and talk in the office,"" he said.""I doubt that this young woman would have asked someone that she thought of as a sexual predator for a letter of reference.""Several Press-Republican attempts to contact the Title IX office coordinator were unsuccessful.RESIGNATION SOUGHTSoon after the intern began her research, Wiley said, the campus exploded when a racist Snapchat — using a racial epithet that referenced lynching African-Americans — was spread across the campus.The student body protested against some administrators, saying they felt the college fostered racism, sexism, hazing and other forms of intolerance, instead of ridding it of them. The Student Association asked for the resignation of some administrators, including Wiley as the chief diversity officer.  'RUMOR NEVER DIED'During a campus-wide meeting of close to 700 students, faculty and staff about the Snapchat incident, Wiley said, a student stood and said: ""I would like to have a chief diversity officer that I haven't heard disrespects women.""Wiley said he was in shock for close to 24 hours after hearing the comment. ""Since 2004, it's been a rumor that's never died,"" he said.""Of course, I didn't expect it (talk of alleged misconduct) to reappear, because my fault is I want to give people the benefit of the doubt — I don't want to rush to judgment.""NO-CONFIDENCE VOTEOn Feb. 19, the SUNY Plattsburgh Student Senate passed votes of no-confidence in Wiley, college President John Ettling and Director of Student Conduct Larry Allen.SUNY Central officials visited campus to speak with students.Wiley points out that about 800 students and alumni signed a petition to save his position. ""These students took classes from me, and they heard me talk about my life experiences, and they heard me talk about the times I've been allies trying to help and support people,"" he said.""They know that this has been my life's work.""WON'T BE SILENTIt was then that a college-run investigation began, and, ultimately, Wiley was terminated from SUNY Plattsburgh. Wiley said university attorneys wanted him to be silent.""I'm not interested in being silent,"" he said. ""I'm interested in people knowing who these people are.""Wiley suspects the campus community was searching for a Me Too movement perpetrator, he said.""They figured every campus has one,"" he said. ""Since the rumor existed about me, my theory is that they decided to go after me. ""We have some attention seekers on our campus who are, ya know, they are looking to be in the spotlight.""I'm suing to defend my reputation,"" Wiley said. ""I want to reveal the posturing, opportunistic, self-defining allies on that campus as self-absorbed misappropriators of the Me Too movement.""NO COMMENTSUNY Plattsburgh Chief of Staff Keith Tyo did not respond specifically but explained the college's procedure.""Anytime a complaint is received about a faculty or staff member's conduct, SUNY Plattsburgh has a set process to thoroughly review and investigate those concerns and address them where applicable, in accordance with federal and state law and SUNY policy,"" he said.""If, during the course of an investigation, information comes to light, we will act."" He said that out of respect for the privacy of students, faculty and staff, the college couldn't say anything else.Email McKenzie Delisle:mdelisle@pressrepublican.comTwitter: @McKenzieDelisle

One glass of scotch and a comment about breasts nearly crippled Syracuse University’s 44-year-old creative writing program in 1995.
Jennifer Cotter, an English graduate student in SU’s Master of Fine Arts (MFA) program, accused Stephen Dobyns, a respected author and tenured professor in the program, of sexual harassment after he allegedly made a comment about her breasts at an off-campus party on the night of March 31, 1995. After the alleged comment, a short, heated exchange of words between the two occurred. It ended when Dobyns threw his drink in Cotter’s face. 
In summer 1995, SU disregarded Dobyns’ denial of ever making the inappropriate comment and suspended the professor for two years starting in April 1995. Dobyns would eventually resign. He declared the creative writing program ‘dead’ in an April 9, 1997, story in The Post-Standard. 
By suspending Dobyns and supporting the claims of Cotter – a Marxist that Dobyns accused of trying to destroy the creative writing program – SU divided the tight-knit creative writing academic community, which consisted of fewer than a dozen professors and 36 students. 
	


  
  


The rift rubbed several professors the wrong way. Fiction professor Michael Martone, the director of the program at the time, and fiction professor Melanie Rae Thon resigned in April 1996 because of the lasting tension in the program. Tobias Wolff, the program’s most celebrated professor at the time, resigned in March 1997 and went to teach at Stanford University.
The resignations took a serious toll on the MFA program’s national reputation. In 1995, 174 people applied to the program. Four years later, the total had dropped to 96.
‘The writing community is very small,’ said Eileen Pollack, director of the creative writing program at the University of Michigan, in an e-mail, ‘at least the community of writers who teach at major colleges and universities, and for a while, writers at other institutions stopped recommending the program at SU to their promising undergraduates.’ 
MFA Director Chris Kennedy and Program Coordinator Sarah C. Harwell agreed the program could have possibly collapsed in the wake of the resignations. 
But it didn’t. The job openings allowed new talent to come in and slowly save the reputation of the program.   
‘In retrospect, (the controversy) was probably a good thing,’ said Kennedy, who was assistant director during the Dobyns scandal. ‘It was like a purging in some way.’
With the arrival of a talented, new roster of fiction and poetry professors in the decade following the incident, the MFA program returned to the top 10 of most creative writing education expert’s rankings.
An improved reputation led to an influx of creative writing applicants. For the 12 annual openings – six in fiction and six in poetry – in the three-year MFA program, 360 people applied in 2007. More than 290 of those applications were for the fiction program. 

Two of the first post-controversy faculty members brought in to turn the MFA program around were professors Arthur Flowers and George Saunders.
Nearly a year before Wolff’s resignation, he asked Saunders to apply for a one-year position in the MFA program. Saunders, who was working as an engineer at the time, seized the opportunity to focus more on his writing.
Saunders’ arrival, along with Flowers, came as a breath of fresh air for the creative writing program.
‘I think between Arthur and me – both basically novice teachers – well, we sort of put out the fires with our general happy cluelessness,’ Saunders said in an e-mail. ‘We hadn’t even been here, and the students knew this.’
The teaching styles of the new professors differed from that of their predecessors.
In summer 1995, SU learned through student and faculty testimony that Dobyns was the creator of a ‘hostile environment’ for the MFA program. Dobyns said what students identified as a ‘hostile environment’ was just necessary criticism that they couldn’t handle, according to a Dec. 3, 1997, story in The Daily Orange.
The post-Dobyns professors provide tough criticism, but they lack the imposing delivery of the controversial figure. 
Third-year fiction graduate student Lisa Levy described Flowers as ‘pathologically encouraging,’ and she said Saunders can pick her work apart word by word without making her feel belittled.
Levy first became interested in SU’s MFA program more than six years ago when she interviewed Saunders for an alternative newspaper in Houston, Texas. She said Saunders spoke ‘lovingly’ of his students. The professors’ compassion for his students remained in the back of Levy’s mind through three years of a grant writing job. When she decided to apply to an MFA program in 2005, SU was one of the first to come to mind.
Saunders’ care for his students remains as strong today as it did six years ago.
‘I do love my students,’ Saunders said in an e-mail. ‘What’s not to love?  They are smart and motivated and have had the courage to step away from life and try to do this very beautiful, odd thing, of trying to learn to write, in a culture that doesn’t always appreciate good writing.’

The Dobyns incident exposed the dangers of extracurricular relationships between students and professors in the creative writing program. Dobyns wrote in an April 4, 1997, ‘Letter to the Editor’ in The Chronicle of Higher Education that many professors he knew no longer attended informal student functions because of the potential complications.
Dobyns’ letter no longer holds true for the MFA program. 	
Bruce Smith, a poetry professor, meets with his students every Friday at King David’s on Marshall Street. He said employees know him on a first-name basis because of the frequency of his informal student-professor sessions.
Last winter, Smith drove an hour to Geneva, N.Y., in the middle of the night to pick up Matt Hotham, a 2007 graduate of the creative writing program at SU. Hotham’s car had broken down, and with limited options, he called his professor for a ride.
‘There’s no real heroism here,’ Smith said in an e-mail. ‘He called me probably because I had a functioning automobile, and he knew my life was so impoverished I would probably be home.’
Likewise, Kennedy started hosting coffee hours for faculty and students seven or eight years ago. The informal gatherings were initially held at a coffee shop on Harvard Place. Kennedy later moved coffee hour to his house on Westcott Avenue. He said as many as 25-30 people would attend the weekly social function. Conversation topics at the functions include everything from post-MFA plans to publishing strategies to Halloween party plans.
Despite the influx of informal interaction among students and faculty, the MFA program has yet to encounter a return to the times of Dobyns. 
James Gendron, a third-year poetry student, considers the peace surprising and laudable.
‘Writing requires you to go off and spend a huge amount of time in your own head,’ Gendron said. ‘For that reason, I think it’s almost remarkable how little infighting and backbiting and garbage there is.’
Poetry professor Michael Burkard said sustaining peace among the MFA faculty and students requires everyone to focus on the creative writing program’s primary purpose: writing. 
‘We take our own writing so seriously,’ Burkard said. ‘With the demands of teaching and being in the university, you spend enough energy. You don’t want to lose it to quarrels and backroom arguments that aren’t gonna really be worth it in the long run.’

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/04/20/career-ends-syracuse,"A former Syracuse University dean and tenured faculty member has been barred from the campus after an internal investigation found evidence of “grossly inappropriate conduct toward students,” including “egregious personal misconduct of physical and emotional abuse involving several individuals,” according to a university statement. Steven Chamberlain, a neuroscience professor, has resigned from Syracuse rather than face a hearing that the university said “certainly would have resulted in his termination.” Syracuse suspended Chamberlain on March 9 and banned him from contacting students and faculty and staff members. The formal charges against him include misconduct, conduct unbecoming a tenured professor and conduct in violation of professional ethics.Chamberlain signed a document acknowledging the accuracy of charges against him, the university statement says. He has said publicly that he resigned because of health concerns. Syracuse officials have not commented on Chamberlain’s statement, and have been tight-lipped on matters relating to the case.Those who provided personal accounts of Chamberlain’s misconduct to the university asked not to be identified publicly, and Syracuse is honoring their requests for anonymity, a university spokesman, Kevin Morrow, said. University officials filed a report on April 13 with the Onondaga County district attorney’s office after learning of what they called “new and troubling allegations.” Morrow said he couldn't expand on the allegations.The University Senate Committee on Academic Freedom, Tenure and Professional Ethics received complaints from faculty members in late January and heard testimony from students about Chamberlain's inappropriate behavior. Donald Mitchell, chairman of the Academic Freedom, Tenure and Professional Affairs Committee, declined to comment, saying the committee’s proceedings are of a private nature.Chamberlain, once dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at Syracuse, was unavailable for comment. Gus Engbretson, chair of the biomedical and chemical engineering department, told Syracuse’s student newspaper, The Daily Orange, that he knew of allegations against Chamberlain but was not privy to the nature of them. The newspaper quoted a student who mentioned that Chamberlain had made comments of a sexual nature during class.Eric Spina, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science, where Chamberlain taught, said that ""faculty and students are surprised and generally unhappy learning that members of the community have been harmed."" He said the recent, more troubling allegations make it even more vital for the university to tell students about support mechanisms on campus.Syracuse sent an alert to students on Monday outlining what constitutes an abusive relationship between students, faculty members, coaches, advisers or supervisors. Heather Comack, a Syracuse student, said news of the investigation has captured the attention of many students and that ""there may be more interest as the charges are investigated.""

A hearing panel of three faculty members deliberated and found that the associate professor violated the consensual relationships provision of the policy on inappropriate conduct by faculty members and the University Code of Ethical Conduct.The panel recommended the professor be dismissed and that his tenure be revoked. Syverud accepted the finding and recommendation, he said.The average salary for an associate SU professor in 2012-2013 was $87,700.The faculty member asked the board of trustees to review the case. Last week after hearing verbal arguments from the professor and the university, trustees upheld the hearing panel's findings.Contact Dave Tobin at 470-3277, dtobin@syracuse.com or via Twitter: @dttobin"

A male associate professor has been fired after he engaged in a consensual relationship with a female undergraduate student whom he taught, Chancellor Kent Syverud announced Tuesday in an email.
A hearing panel of three faculty members found the professor violated the consensual relationships provision of the Policy on Inappropriate Conduct by Faculty Members and the University Code of Ethical Conduct. The panel recommended he be dismissed from service, including revocation of tenure, Syverud said in the email.
The professor requested the Board of Trustees review the case, and last week, after hearing arguments from the university and the professor, the Board upheld the panel’s decision.
Kevin Quinn, senior vice president for public affairs, said in an email that the case against the professor was a months-long process that spanned multiple semesters. He added that the verbal arguments and discussion during the Board of Trustees hearing lasted “a significant amount of time.”
	


  
  


Quinn said there is no record of a tenured professor being fired via this process at Syracuse University. If it did occur, Quinn said, “it would have been decades ago.”
Syverud said in the email that the professor taught, advised and supervised the student during the course of the relationship.
Section 4.1 of the faculty manual outlines SU’s stance on inappropriate conduct by faculty members. Part V of that section elaborates on consensual relationships, stating that relationships between university faculty members and any person for whom they have a professional responsibility, “may develop into professional conflicts of interest, or at least create the perception of such a conflict of interest, that may make it difficult to carry out a role as educator or supervisor.”
The policy goes on to state that potential for difficulties, including harassment or abuse of power, to occur, “is particularly strong in relationships between teachers and students they are teaching and/or advising.”
“This policy thus prohibits University Faculty Members from pursuing sexual relationships with undergraduate students they teach, advise or supervise.” (Faculty Manual, section 4.1 Part V)
Syverud said in a May 12 memorandum that the university brought charges last year based on the professor’s alleged violation of the consensual relationships provision of the policy.

https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/07/16/prominent-taylor-university-professor-leaves-amid-sexual-harassment-allegation,"A professor at Taylor University, who built the evangelical institution’s well-known professional writing program and is renowned in Christian publishing circles, has resigned amid accusations dating back 14 years that he kissed a student without her consent and has inappropriately touched other women.
Taylor officials were told at least three times of Dennis E. Hensley’s alleged misconduct over the 21 years that he worked at the university before they ultimately suspended him. He stepped down the same day, according to a statement the university issued Thursday.
One of his former advisees reported in 2004 that in a closed-door meeting, after she told Hensley that she had been raped just hours before, Hensley hugged her and kissed both her face and mouth while she cried. During this incident and on other occasions, Hensley was confronted and reprimanded, the university said, though it appeared he was never removed from his position. The university announced Thursday it had suspended him after fresh allegations surfaced.
In an interview with Inside Higher Ed, Hensley, 69, denied any wrongdoing, saying he intended his behavior over the years to be supportive or consoling. He said it has now been misconstrued.
“I was trying to be gracious. I was trying to be comforting. I meant nothing in the way of any harm to her,” Hensley said regarding the episode involving his advisee. “Now this is coming out 14 years later, with this whole 'Me Too' kind of thing, and everyone is piling on the bandwagon.”
The earliest incident that Taylor officials have acknowledged is the one with Hensley’s advisee, Rachel Custer, who was 23 when she enrolled at Taylor in fall 2004.
In an interview, Custer said she picked Taylor University specifically for the professional writing program and Christian atmosphere. She grew up religious, though not evangelical, but wanted to be around “like-minded people.” She said she was particularly excited to work with Hensley, who had an excellent reputation as a mentor and author.
Early one morning in October 2004, Custer met a man at a pool hall who, she said, raped her. Custer said she reported the assault to the police around 5 a.m. the following day and felt she still needed to make a meeting with Hensley that afternoon. She was a transfer student and had questions about completing her degree.
As she was speaking to Hensley in his office, with the door shut, Custer said, she was visibly upset about what had happened and proceeded to tell him about it. Hensley appeared shocked and nearly jumped out of his chair, she said.
Custer said Hensley moved to comfort her, shifting closer and holding her hands while she cried. When she went to leave, she said, Hensley drew her in for a hug, which she said lasted too long to be comfortable.
Hensley moved back, she said, removed her glasses and his own and began to kiss her tears. Then he kissed her on the mouth, Custer said.
Custer said she pulled away and asked Hensley, “Don’t you have a wife?” Hensley replied that had she had been diagnosed with lupus and was “in a lot of pain,” and that he had not held a woman for a long time. He kissed her again, according to Custer.
“It’s just hard to explain how much this messed with me,” she said. “After the situation I’d been through, I thought I was in a place that was completely safe.”
Before Custer left the room, she said, Hensley told her that this would be their “little secret.”
Custer said she ran to her car and phoned her father, crying. Her father said she should turn around and drive back to campus while he phoned the dean of students to report what happened.
In a meeting with Custer, her mother and four university administrators less than a week later, Custer recalled, one official told them his own daughter had been taught never to meet with a man with the door closed.
University officials told Custer that Hensley would have a “letter” put into his file and would receive counseling. She had also intended to report the incident to police in Fort Wayne, Ind., but said police told her that Hensley had done nothing illegal. She never officially filed a report.
She said she couldn’t stay at Taylor afterward and left, weeks into the semester. Custer finished her undergraduate degree at Indiana University South Bend.
“I don’t want this to be seen as an attack on the church, but it harmed a lot of my faith, honestly,” Custer said. “What I wanted at the time was for him to pay, I wanted him to be fired, at the very least. But no one seemed to care what I wanted.”
Hensley remembered the incident differently and denied ever kissing Custer.
A veteran of the Vietnam War, Hensley said he recognized trauma and said Custer was shaking violently. He said he touched Custer's shoulders after she divulged the rape and told her it “would be OK” and that she should seek professional help. He said he embraced her briefly.
But her report of kissing was “fabrication,” Hensley said.
He later met with administrators who said he would have a note put in his file. Hensley said the officials believed him when he said he was using his combat experience to calm Custer. Hensley said he was told never to touch another student and that when he met with female students from then on he would keep his distance and remain seated at his desk. He said he never had another complaint.
“She was totally in shock -- she doesn’t remember the situation the way it was,” Hensley said of Custer.
What led to Hensley’s suspension, and eventually his departure, were “significant and credible allegations of serious misconduct” that officials investigated, according to the university’s statement. A Taylor spokesman, Jim Garringer, declined to discuss Hensley beyond the statement, which reads in part:

“As a Christian institution of higher education, guided by biblical principles of truth, justice and grace, Taylor is grieved by any instance of predatory behavior or abuse of power. We hold accountable each member of our community with the expectation they adhere to the highest ethical, behavioral, and moral standards. We are committed to providing an environment of dignity, respect and safety for all members of our community.”

Hensley said the accusations come from people who participated in writers’ conferences, which he has attended for the last 25 years. But in the last six months, he said, participants had accused him of making inappropriate remarks or of touching them.
Often, attendees at these conferences have written stories that express pain, he said. When they read the stories they might break down in tears, hold Hensley’s hand and pray or hug him, he said.
“I’ve always been outgoing, but in this era, that has been described going too far,” he said. “I regret that we’ve come to that, that we’ve gotten to that point. I don’t want to hold hands when we’re praying, or return a hug, so I think it’s an interpretation of what’s going on in the media.”
After he was suspended, Hensley said, he decided to resign because he planned on retiring soon anyway. He said his wife was suffering from cancer and needed more care as well.
Taylor's statement also referenced two other “situations,” which officials didn’t elaborate on, in which Hensley was disciplined.
Hensley said neither of the incidents involved students. In 2010, he said, he was meeting in his office, with his door closed, with his housekeeper, who had just come into an inheritance and wanted advice. Hensley said someone saw that and reported it to the university, believing it to be inappropriate.
On another occasion, three or four years ago, Hensley said, a woman who wanted help with a historical novel she was writing met with Hensley at his apartment -- this, too, was reported to the institution. Hensley edits manuscripts and considers himself a “book doctor.”
Both times, officials met with him and told him he needed to consider appearances, Hensley said. He didn't recall being disciplined, as the university referenced in its statement.
“I guess they were worried about conduct in a Christian college,” he said.
Hensley joined Taylor University full-time in 1997, working at the now-closed Fort Wayne campus. In 2009, the institution created a full department for professional writing because it had grown so rapidly, he said. And recently it was folded into a much more comprehensive communications department.
Hensley estimated that 1,200 students have graduated from the program he helped build -- he said it has attracted students who went on to be editors, work at major publishing houses and write award-winning books. Hensley has written 64 books but doesn’t have any in the works, he said. He is considered a major player in his field and has been celebrated for running one of the finest writing programs in the country.
As a professor, he was known as old-school and somewhat militaristic in class, with clear favoritism toward male students, said Hannah Schaefer, who graduated from the professional writing program last year.
Female students often were uncomfortable around him because he didn't respect personal boundaries and would often talk too close to their faces, Schaefer said. He was Schaefer's adviser her first two years at Taylor, but he never acted inappropriately with her, she said.
""But there was this unspoken rule, sometimes not, to avoid him,"" she said.
She said Taylor administrators didn't do their job because Hensley's behavior was documented, but that the university leaned heavily on him to market the program because he was so prominent and frequently published. When she was interested in joining the program, before she enrolled at Taylor, Hensley reached out to Schaefer directly and invited her to visit campus. He also accompanied students to writing conferences on occasion and, according to Schaefer, knew ""everyone"" in publishing. He would bring in editors and publishers, who would speak glowingly of him in lectures, Schaefer said.
Only once, when Hensley brought in a former student to address a class, did she hear anything negative. That student said they didn't have to listen to Hensley's advice as gospel, and that he would try to capitalize and take advantage of them if they did become successful, Schaefer said.
Another 2017 Taylor alumna, Kaitlyn Duchien, said she left the major after a single semester and moved to study social work in part because of Hensley's teaching style. She also never encountered any inappropriate behavior, but said Hensley would stand a little too close when he spoke with her and would hold eye contact too long.
""I couldn’t come to him and comfortably talk about writing ideas, or how I could improve. It felt so intimidating to approach him,"" Duchien said, adding that she felt pressured by Hensley when she told him she was abandoning the program.
""I could see how he could have easily taken advantage or put someone in a corner because of his very domineering or aggressive type of behavior,"" she said.
According to Jim Watkins, one of Hensley’s former colleagues, Hensley’s victims have “suffered.”
Watkins, a writer and former book editor, taught at Taylor for 15 years. He credits Hensley with giving him “the privilege to teach,” he wrote in a post on his personal website.
He wrote that Hensley’s academic and teaching career were over after allegations went public that Hensley had been uninvited from speaking engagements, and that his books were being removed from publishers' websites. Hensley said he was unaware of this.
“Sadly, there are some accusers who are not content with these necessary consequences but want the proposed punishment in The Merchant of Venice -- a ‘pound of flesh,’” Watkins wrote. “I believe justice has been served, but I’m afraid what some women on Facebook and Twitter really want is blood.”
He added, “This is the time for confession and repentance on Dr. Hensley’s part. (There is absolutely no excuse for this sinful behavior.) This is also a time for forgiveness and healing for his victims. (I’ve talked to many of them and am appalled and heartbroken in what they suffered.) Balancing justice and mercy is a delicate balance -- perhaps something that only God can accomplish. I will allow him to bring those together in this case.”

                By Matt Phinney
        
Robert Shindell will not work for Angelo State University after all.  University spokesman Preston Lewis confirmed Wednesday that Shindell, a former associate vice president for recruiting and admissions at Texas Tech University, no longer has a one-year contract to serve as special projects adviser for the school.  Lewis said he could not provide details because it is a personnel matter.  The ASU contract caused a stir in some circles because of Shindell's employment history with Texas Tech University. This year, an employee who worked under Shindell while at a previous job at Texas Tech withdrew a harassment complaint against Texas Tech University in exchange for $20,000, a promotion and other perks.  A Texas Tech report that came out in August 2007 concluded that Shindell had violated three university policies that exist to protect workers against discrimination, sexual harassment and retaliation.  Shindell, 36, has said he was looking forward to working in San Angelo but did not return calls seeking comment on Wednesday. He was to report to the ASU vice presidents and the assistant to the university president.  Word about the contract split came about a week after initial reports indicated Shindell had a one-year contract with ASU for $120,000.  Shindell has denied the issues raised in the complaint. He left Texas Tech several months ago, saying it was for a reason unrelated to the complaint.  Attempts to reach the Texas Tech University System Board of Regents through the system office were unsuccessful. ASU President Joseph C. Rallo was out of the office and could not be reached for comment, and Provost Donald Coers also couldn't be reached for comment.  Rallo has said Shindell's expertise in certain areas would help ASU in its quest to increase enrollment. He also said Shindell would work for the university for a fixed amount of time.  ""There was an opportunity to take advantage of his experience,"" Rallo told the Standard-Times in September. ""That's what we looked at.""  No announcement was made about the contract, which took effect Sept. 8, and no one other than Shindell was interviewed for the work.   His list of specific duties included working on a study to determine ASU's economic impact on San Angelo, ways to increase ASU's enrollment, and ways to increase educational quality while keeping the cost affordable to students.  ASU history professor Charles Endress, who wanted to make clear he was not speaking for the university and was only stating his opinion, said he found it strange there was not a more public search for such an important and well-paid position.  It's possible there was no search because Shindell would have been a consultant and not a permanent employee, Endress said.  Still, he called the hiring process ""unseemly"" and the explanation given for his hiring ""not credible.""  ""We're sensitive about that at ASU,"" Endress said. ""Money wasn't an issue, and not having a search wasn't an issue because I don't know how that works. The part that bothers me is, all the sudden, we have an employee that has resigned at Texas Tech under a cloud.""

                                ASU hired a former Texas Tech administrator nearly two weeks ago who, according to Rallo, will help maximize the benefits of being a part of the Texas Tech University System. Robert Shindell, ASU's new special assistant to the provost, Dr. Donald Coers, accepted the one-year, six-figure-salary contract. Both Rallo and Coers said Shindell was hired because of his unique qualifications regarding recruiting, contacts at Tech and history with the TTUS.""We are looking at somebody who has been at the institution (Tech) for years, who has certain expertise,"" Rallo said.No one else had been interviewed for this position, according to the president, and Shindell was an opportunity to meet the needs of a growing campus.Dr. Charles Endress, faculty advisor for the Center of Academic Excellence, said that it seems peculiar not interviewing other individuals given the importance of the position and the salary attached to it.
        ""Given what we are trying to do-recruit and retain students-you'd think there would have been a national search,"" Endress said. ""You can connect the dots.""According to Sharon Meyer, vice president for fiscal affairs, his salary will come from university reserves and was not listed in the originally-published budget for 2008-2009. Meyer said the position Shindell is working in now had to be created and did not exist prior to his employment. According to Tech, Shindell's previous salary was $132,600.Discrimination Case According to the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, one of Shindell's former co-workers reported that he ""denied her opportunities to advance in her job because of her national origin,"" and made comments about her body.Jennifer Diaz, who worked with Shindell in Tech's business college's Career Management Center, also said Shindell once slapped her near the upper thigh and butt, saying that continuing to eat fast food would make her gain weight, according to the story. The newspaper also said Diaz dropped the discrimination case against him in exchange for a $30,000 a year salary increase and another $20,000 for compensation. The Avalanche-Journal also said Shindell denied the allegations and reached a resignation agreement with the university in June, but said it had nothing to do with the complaint.Rallo's response to these claims about the new employee: ""I don't think it's an issue whatsoever.""Rallo said that it is understandable for people to react to Shindell's past, but ASU should focus more on his professional experience as a benefit.""Everyone needs to be concerned, but I think also we need to understand that the person was hired because of the expertise based upon recommendations, based upon opportunity,"" Rallo said.Rallo said that it is a valid point to question what kind of example this is setting for the university.""I'm not trying to minimize that, but the person also has the track record of ten or twelve years.What will Shindell do for ASU?¬According to Coers, Shindell will focus several initiatives: an economic impact study, enrollment management, goals to reach Hispanic Serving Institution status, and other ways to take fullest advantage of ASU's merger with Tech.Shindell will work on high level, special projects, such as, a study to comprehend how much economic impact ASU has on the community.""We had a need, we had an opportunity and so we hired an individual,"" Rallo said.Texas Tech also completed the economic impact study and Rallo wants to use their model for ASU.
        ""A lot of people don't realize what economic impact the university has."" Rallo said. ""We want to go out there and say 'For every new student, what does that represent in terms of buying power in the community?'""For example, the construction of Centennial Village, according to Rallo, represented approximately $28 million. ""That put a lot of people to work,"" Rallo said.Coers and Rallo first met Shindell last fall when ASU aligned with Tech. According to Rallo, they found out about Shindell and his experience with enrollment management.

Evidence from students and from the University of Alabama website suggested that Dr. Parisi did start the summer session teaching two courses and is now out of the classroom after KCBD aired its story.Today we received another written statement from University of Alabama media relations.That statement reads, ""Dr. Parisi taught class for two days of each course he was scheduled to teach this summer before the university and Dr. Parisi agreed last week that it would be best for him not to teach due to allegations being made in Texas. We don't plan to comment further on this since it involves a personnel matter.""Former Dean Nail offered evidence of his communications with Alabama Department Chair Matt Holt in which he told Dr. Holt of Dr. Parisi's behavior.We have asked University of Alabama officials if Dr. Holt has been disciplined or demoted as a result of ignoring this information.They have not responded.=====Dr. Lance Nail, the former Dean of the Rawls College of Business at Texas Tech University, says there are inaccuracies in a Title IX investigation.As we first reported last week, that investigation concluded that Dr. Nail failed in his responsibilities as a dean of the college after one of his friends and colleagues was accused of sexual harassment on a university trip.According to the investigation, there had been a couple of red flags surrounding Dr. Franco Parisi.Despite reports of inappropriate behavior, Dr. Nail allowed him to go on that university sponsored trip to Chile.That's where the concerns escalated and prompted the Title IX investigation.However, Dr. Nail, argues that there are errors in that investigation.One of the incidents that created concern prior to the trip involved Dr. Franco Parisi and a staff member drinking during work hours at the university.According to the report, that staff member became so intoxicated she passed out.The Title IX investigation concludes that Dr. Parisi abandoned the staff member in a life-threatening condition.However, Dr. Nail argues that Dr. Parisi never abandoned her, he only left the office to let the woman's husband into the building.Following that incident, Dr. Nail shortened Dr. Parisi's arrangement with Texas Tech, but he still wanted Dr. Parisi to attend the trip to ChileDr. Parisi had several relationships in Chile where he was a former presidential candidate.This investigation states, ""Not only was Dr. Nail the only person with full knowledge of Dr. Parisi's prior behavior, but he was also the Dean of the College and as such the person who was responsible for making decisions about whether it was appropriate for Dr. Parisi to be on the trip.""However, Dr. Nail argues that a faculty member who attended the trip also had full knowledge of the drinking incident involving Dr. Parisi, and still wanted him to attend.Dr. Nail had originally planned on attending the trip to minimize Dr. Parisi's interaction with students outside of class, but, he was asked to attend a board of regents meeting and could not make it.This investigation states he failed to notify the EEO Office or Human Resources of his change of plans, something Dr. Nail says he did not know he was obligated to do.Students who attended the trip told investigators Dr. Parisi sexually harassed a student and was completely inappropriate.Dr. Nail said a faculty member did make him aware of some of the concerns, but asked him not to intervene at the time.Dr. Nail said that while he was aware of some of the inappropriate behavior, he was not made fully aware of all of Dr. Parisi's actions.Following the trip, Dr. Nail said he wrote a letter to  Dr. Parisi telling him he was banned from campus and from interacting with students.Nail said he would contact the campus police if Parisi were seen back on campus.KCBD has learned that Dr. Parisi went on to another teaching position at the University of Alabama in the fall of 2015.We asked Texas Tech if Alabama was made aware of the incidents involving Dr. Parisi.Texas Tech sent us this statement, ""We believe there was communication to parties at the University of Alabama during early summer of 2015.""KCBD contacted the University of Alabama who emailed us this statement, ""Dr. Parisi is on a one-year appointment that ends August 15, but he is not teaching this summer. We are not going to comment further.""However, according to the university's online syllabus management, Dr. Parisi was scheduled to teach this summer, something we confirmed with students at the university.RELATED STORIES:KCBD Investigates: Title IX accusations against former TTU deanKCBD Investigates: Sexual Harassment allegations spark Title IX Investigation at Texas TechCopyright 2016 KCBD.

The report said, “From August 2012 to March 30, 2018, Duane Hill (Prof. Hill) was the Associate Director of Bands, the Director of Athletic Bands, and the camp director of TTU Band and Orchestra Camp.” 



Hill directed the Goin’ Band, the Court Jesters, and the Concert Band, according to the report.  A student came forward in January to complain about Hill communicating inappropriately through an app.  All of the students within the scope of the investigation were male. 



The report concluded that Hill on more than one occasion used social media to send videos or photos of himself engaged in a particular sexual act.



On one occasion, the report said Hill requested a student send him a nude photo and the student complied. The professor described, according to the report, what he wanted to do while looking at the nude photo. 



The report said there was a perception by some of the students that those who went along with Hill would get preferential treatment and better assignments.  The perception among some students was also failure to go along with Hill “might negatively affect their opportunities both in school and thereafter.”





“While these were perceptions voiced by a number of students, no evidence was presented to demonstrate that these perceptions went beyond conjecture,” the report said.



The report said it appears that grades and assignment were based on merit. 



The report said Hill had consensual encounters and/or relationships with students but also had non-consensual sexual communications with students.  The report said these non-consensual communications created a hostile environment and violated Texas Tech’s policy against sexual harassment.



Not all sexual relationships between Texas Tech professors and students are forbidden, but they are forbidden when it creates a conflict of interest or a potential abuse of power.





Among the conclusions of the report, “… His inappropriate communications and encounters created real conflicts of interest as well as the appearance of conflicts of interest.”



It said Hill violated Texas Tech’s operating procedure regarding sexual harassment.

Psychology researcher Emanuele Castano joined Stanford Medicine as a visiting professor this November after resigning from a tenured professorship at another institution amid a Title IX sexual misconduct investigation.
Castano, who was previously co-chair of the psychology department at The New School for Social Research (NSSR), resigned from the NSSR in October one day before the planned release of the decision in his Title IX case. The student who reported sexual misconduct and harassment was previously in a relationship with him as an undergraduate.

According to University spokesperson E.J. Miranda, Castano’s role at Stanford is unpaid and does not include teaching responsibilities. Instead, Castano is a research collaborator with the Center for Compassion and Altruism Research and Education (CCARE); his biography on the research center’s website describes him as a tenured professor at The New School. University Communications contacted Stanford’s Title IX office about the allegations against Castano after The Daily notified the University Tuesday night.
On Friday night, shortly after this story was posted, University spokesperson Lisa Lapin told The Daily that Castano’s visiting professorship has been suspended while Stanford investigates.
After learning of Castano’s recent move to Stanford, several students from the psychology department at the NSSR have spoken out about the investigation and what they describe as Castano’s long-standing reputation for pursuing and harassing students. 
According to five graduate students in the department, all of whom asked to remain anonymous, fellow students who have taken classes with Castano said he made lewd comments, rubbed students’ shoulders inappropriately and flirted frequently with female undergraduate and graduate students during class. A former graduate student of Castano’s also recalled feeling uncomfortable during class and described it as an “unprofessional” environment. 
Other rumors that Castano had sexual and romantic relationships with both undergraduate and graduate students circulated prior to the investigation against him. A NSSR psychology Ph.D. student who spoke to The Daily said she was not surprised to hear about the investigation – something others from the school echoed. 
“Emanuele has always been known to be someone who has sex with students,” said the student, who requested anonymity for career reasons. 
The student who filed the Title IX complaint against Castano in July released to The Daily an official letter about the case from Jennifer Francone, assistant vice president of student equity and access at The New School. 
The letter, dated Oct. 17, informed the student of Castano’s official resignation from the NSSR, stating that a no-contact directive would remain in place as she finished her studies and adding that “in light of Professor Castano’s resignation, we consider this matter closed.” Other than this letter, the student says she did not receive any official notification of the outcome of the investigation.
The student added that her formal complaint included charges of threats and manipulation against Castano. Immediately following her initial report, she stated that Castano repeatedly called her from several different Italian phone numbers. She said that he called her from Italian numbers knowing she might respond because she has family members residing in the country and that he blocked the digits of the phone numbers to get her to answer. When she did respond, she stated, he would harass her about Human Resources contacting him.
Castano did not respond to multiple requests for comment from The Daily.
The reporting student’s story
According to the student who made the complaint, she first met Castano at the age of 18 as an undergraduate at The New School and had her first class with him during her sophomore year. She said she was sexually harassed by Castano during her final semester as an undergraduate this past spring, when she was 22.
She recounted that she became seriously ill with T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma after taking his class and joining his lab as an undergraduate researcher last year, going into remission for a period before becoming ill once again in her final semester. She emailed him to say she couldn’t make it to class one day during that semester, to which he responded saying he was sorry and asking if she wanted to have dinner with him and his child.
According to the student, after Castano’s child fell asleep, the professor asked her to stay up with him to finish watching the movie Pulp Fiction. She said that, at that point, she was intoxicated from the wine they had drunk during dinner as well as from marijuana that they had shared. 
She recalled that Castano made a sexual advance toward her and that she didn’t hesitate because she felt pressured by the fact that he was not only her professor, advisor and boss, but also the co-chair of the psychology department. She added that she was unsure whether the encounter was consensual because she was under the influence.
“I was intoxicated, but from a legal standpoint I was conscious enough to not be considered sexually assaulted,” she said. 
After that night, she returned to his home 15 to 20 times between March 6 and May 3 and occasionally slept over. She says that these instances included a mix of both consensual and nonconsensual sexual encounters with Castano.
During an early encounter, she reports that Castano didn’t ask for consent before penetrating her anally, and that he attempted to penetrate her anally on multiple later occasions despite her requests to the contrary. The student also said that Castano’s preference for restraining her during sex made her uncomfortable.
She added that she felt pressured to maintain a sexual relationship with him for academic reasons and because her income was dependent on babysitting his child.
“Everything I would do academically depended on his approval as chair of the department and as my advisor,” the student said. 
According to the student, she found out in April that he was dating Namrata Goyal, a former Ph.D. student and current postdoctoral fellow at the NSSR, and confronted him about his habit of sleeping with students. She says that Castano responded by telling her that “these things happen in institutions all the time.” He reportedly told her that if she ever told the school about their relationship, she would be making his child fatherless as Castano would lose his job and have to move elsewhere. The student noted that she had formed a strong connection with Castano’s child, whom she had been babysitting for three years at that point. 
“It was manipulation,” she said. “At the time it didn’t seem that way because he cooked me dinner, checked in on me daily regarding my health, offered to come to the hospital and took ‘care’ of me during a time I was scared.” 
The last time she saw Castano was the night of May 2, she said, right before he left to teach in Italy. 
That same summer, while the student was preparing to resume treatment for her illness, she received blood work results stating that she could not begin treatment because she had gotten pregnant. She recounted that she had not had sex with anyone else during that period of time, and reported the situation to Title IX after Castano denied responsibility when she tried to speak to him about it. 
Growing concerns
In an email sent to psychology students in early September, Dean and Professor of Economics at the NSSR William Milberg announced that Castano was on leave and that William Hirst would be replacing him as the new co-chair of the psychology department. 
The Ph.D. student quoted previously said that when she approached Castano’s office to get an administrative form signed, the psychology department’s secretary stated that he had been banned from campus and from having contact with his students while the investigation was ongoing. The student said she corroborated this information in August with several Ph.D. students working in Castano’s lab at the NSSR at the time, and that the students confirmed the investigation was under way. 
Senior Director of Communications and Public Affairs at the NSSR Amy Malsin declined to address specific allegations against Castano, stating that “the university does not comment on current or former employees.” 
“The New School has no tolerance for sexual harassment by any member of the university community,” Malsin wrote in an email to The Daily. “We take our responsibility in these matters very seriously and have clear policies and procedures which we follow thoroughly.”
In mid-September, several students in the New School’s psychology department approached the Title IX committee about the investigation, but were told that Castano would not be removed from his faculty position at the NSSR unless he demonstrated a pattern of sexual misconduct. Frustrated by what they saw as the administration’s lack of transparency on the investigation, a group of psychology Ph.D. students drafted a formal letter and addendum to the Title IX committee regarding the allegations against Castano. 
The letter pressed the university to take stronger action against Castano and to establish clearer codes of conduct for faculty members given the “attempts … made at a diversion of this investigation and outright intimidation of students to prevent them from coming forward.” In particular, the letter alleged that a postdoctoral fellow – later identified to The Daily as Goyal by one of its writers – tried “to coerce students to sign affidavits that blame the victim.” 
According to the student who reported Castano, a friend of hers as well as a fellow lab member were asked to write affidavits claiming her to be of “bad nature”; the Ph.D. student who co-authored the letter added that the affidavit claimed the reporting student was lying and mentally unstable. A student reported the incident to the Title IX office, the Ph.D. student said. But according to Joan Miller, a psychology professor and postdoctoral advisor to Goyal,  Goyal was never subject to an investigation.
In the fall of 2015, Goyal was hired as a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Psychology. She currently holds this position and teaches several required graduate courses. According to Miller, Castano disclosed his relationship to Goyal to the school’s dean before her hire and recused himself from departmental decisions about Goyal, who was approved in a unanimous faculty vote.
By the Ph.D. student’s account, Castano and Goyal have denied being in a relationship while Goyal was a student. However, several students in the psychology department stated that it is an open secret among members of the department that their relationship began while she was a Ph.D. student in the department during his stint as co-chair. 
Goyal is not returning to teach next semester; according to Miller, this is at Goyal’s own request. Both Goyal and the administration from The New School did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment on her involvement in the Title IX case and her role at NSSR next semester.
The New School’s official policy on sexual harassment states that “faculty members (and administrative staff) should be aware that any romantic involvement with students (or staff members who report to them) is considered inappropriate, and it might make them liable to formal action.”
In their email to the Title IX committee, the NSSR students said that they felt Goyal too was a “victim in the situation Dr. Castano created” and that their main aim to make clear “the harm students have experienced due to his poor judgment, abuse of power and manipulation.” The letter ultimately garnered 60 signatures of support from students within the psychology department.
The Ph.D. student quoted earlier added that students who used to work in Castano’s former lab declined to sign the letter, some out of loyalty to Goyal and others out of fear.
Administrative response
Psychology students concerned about Castano’s behavior and previous incidents of sexual harassment and assault at NSSR said that some administrators at NSSR have impeded reports and investigations.
Within days, Milberg responded to the letter in an email to all students, faculty and staff in the psychology department. In his message, he promised to “convene a meeting to facilitate an open and safe dialogue on issues that have been raised about the culture and climate of the Department” and assured that “the ongoing investigation into the allegations raised is being conducted in a full and fair manner.”
Shortly thereafter, department co-chairs William Hirst and Howard Steele jointly responded in an email arguing that “it would be wrong for us, as a representative of the school, to discuss or even convene a meeting to address the specifics of the complaint that has been filed against a faculty member.” 
They also cited the “principle of … confidentiality for both complainant and respondent” under Title IX and the need to allow the investigation to occur “without evoking external pressures” that such a meeting might cause, adding that they feared public discussion prior to the investigation’s completion could harm its integrity. They advised that for the time being, faculty, students and staff should focus on developing avenues for open dialogue after the investigation’s closure rather than discussing the case directly.
A week after Hirst and Steele’s statement, Milberg announced a psychology department town hall meeting to be held on Oct. 19. But on Oct. 18, Milberg sent another email announcing Castano’s resignation from the university without specifying a reason. The town hall was still held but framed as a more general discussion about student concerns with the university administration, including Title IX issues.
A student who attended the town hall meeting said that that several students from the psychology department, including herself, came forward during the meeting to say they had experienced sexual harassment and assault from within the department. 
She added that it isn’t just students who are affected. 
“Professors fear speaking out against their superiors, just as students do,” the town hall attendee said. “The administration thrives on silencing students … [and] is concerned about [its] reputation.”
Another graduate student expressed a similar sentiment, saying that the department has had “complicated power dynamics, historically.” According to the Ph.D. student mentioned earlier in the article, there exists an unhealthy power structure among university faculty. 
She specifically claimed that co-chair “Hirst is [and] was Emanuele [Castano]’s main ally and supporter.” She also said that after Hirst was appointed co-chair, “no one could talk to him about it due to his personal ties to Emanuele. The other faculty who have tenure and could speak out, even those that disapprove of Emanuele, didn’t.” 
“A few longtime faculty members within [the department] protect and support Castano, and even implicitly or explicitly discourage people from speaking out,” remarked another graduate student in the psychology department. “[Bill Hirst] has been vocal in support of Castano, protecting him for many years.”
Hirst did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment regarding the aforementioned allegations.
Miller, however, defended Hirst in a statement to The Daily following this article’s publication, emphasizing in particular that Hirst avoided discussing Castano’s case with students not out of any “personal bias” but because he sought to uphold the confidentiality of an ongoing case.
All faculty members were told by the school administration “not to provide any information related to Professor Castano” or his investigation, Miller said.
The Ph.D. student added that two professors, Wendy D’Andrea and Doris Chang, were supportive of students during the investigation. According to Chang, there has been no official discussion among faculty about Castano’s behavior up to this point.
In an email to New School community members sent three days after this article’s posting, the president and provost of The New School said the university will be reviewing its Title IX policies, appointing a new Title IX leader and expanding its training on sexual misconduct.
Shortly after, the school’s Graduate Faculty Student Senate issued a statement calling the Castano’s investigation “completely mismanaged” and urging the university to issue a decision in his now-closed case. The senate also called on the school to review its administration’s handling of the matter and work to end “any type of abuse of power by any administrator, faculty, or other persons that hold a significant degree of institutional authority over any member of the New School community.”
“The email sent today signed by [the president and provost] does too little too late,” the statement reads. “Perhaps disclosing New School grievances to the media is the only way to make any changes and to make the administrative authorities hear us.”
Other allegations of misconduct
The Title IX investigation into Castano’s behavior comes just two years after the retirement of Marcel Kinsbourne, a formerly tenured professor in the same division of the psychology department as Castano who was a prominent neuroscientist. According to several students in the department, Kinsbourne was forced to retire after being investigated by the Title IX office for sexual harassment of several undergraduate and graduate students and faced no repercussions related to the investigation. 
The students added that Kinsbourne’s history of sexual harassment was widely known among students at the time of the investigation, when Castano was co-chair of the department. 
Kinsbourne did not respond to The Daily’s request for comment.
According to the aforementioned Ph.D. student, a victim of Kinsbourne’s harassment who was a graduate student of Kinsbourne’s at the time approached Castano (then department co-chair) to report concern over Kinsbourne’s behavior. Castano allegedly dismissed the complaint and expressed concern about how such allegations would look if they were to come out while he was co-chair. The victim then went directly to the dean of the undergraduate college, Stephanie Browner, and Kinsbourne retired shortly after. 
Castano’s appointment at Stanford, along with news of the Title IX investigation against him, comes as two former Stanford professors — Jay Fliegelman Ph.D. ’77, who is now deceased, and Franco Moretti, who is now retired — face public accusations of sexual assault and harassment. Like Fliegelman and Moretti, Castano is well-established in his field. 
According to his biography on Stanford Medicine’s CCARE website, Castano has over 60 publications in “top tier scientific journals” and has been funded by the National Science Foundation, the European Union and the International Committee of the Red Cross, among others. Like Moretti, he has also been featured in The New York Times, which detailed his studies on empathy in a front-page article. Just last week, Castano, Kinsbourne and Goyal published a paper together about a study they conducted on empathy and willingness to help others.
“I think it’s really important that students are starting to speak openly and honestly about their experiences in the program,” said Chang, the NSSR professor. “I’m concerned that they’ve experienced this oppressive culture in which they have felt so silenced. That goes against my values as a faculty member and the kinds of values that I’m trying to promote in the department.”

An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Goyal was investigated by the Title IX committee at The New School. In fact, while a student reportedly took concerns about Goyal’s affidavit to Title IX, Goyal was not investigated.  The article now includes New School Psychology Professor Joan Miller’s statement that Goyal is leaving her post next semester at her own request. Castano also did not oversee Goyal’s hiring, as suggested in the initial version of the article; Castano recused himself from the hiring decision, which was voted on by faculty. The Daily regrets these errors.
Finally, this post has been updated to reflect that Stanford has suspended Castano while it investigates the allegations against him. The University told The Daily of the suspension shortly after this article’s posting. The article is also updated with communications that the president, provost and Graduate Faculty Student Senate of The New School made to the university’s community following publication, as well as with further comments  from Miller on the administration’s directive to all faculty not to discuss Castano’s case.

The last of the three men charged in a murder-for-hire plot against a Tidewater Community College professor last year admitted his role and was ordered to serve eight and a half years in prison on Wednesday.
The defendant, Jay Glosser, 54, a former associate professor of information systems technology at the Norfolk campus, will serve six months more than his co-defendants. He reached a plea agreement with prosecutors, in which he pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, solicitation and conspiracy to commit extortion. He waived his pre-sentence report and was sentenced Wednesday to 35 years with all but eight and a half suspended.
Glosser, of Queenswood Terrace in Chesapeake, was accused of conspiring to kill another TCC professor, Kimberly Perez, who had filed a sexual harassment complaint against him. Worried that the complaint could cost him his job, Glosser turned to his neighbor, Chesapeake trucking company owner Raymond Groves Sr., prosecutors said.
Glosser told Groves he was willing to pay $3,000 to $4,000 to get Perez to withdraw the complaint or $10,000 to “take her out,” according to trial testimony.
According to prosecutors, Groves hired F. Devin Scott, a Portsmouth truck driver, to kill Perez if she did not pay $10,000 and recant the sexual harassment complaint. However, the plot unraveled during a State Police sting in June 2006, and the three men were arrested.				
"
https://www.pilotonline.com/2008/03/03/tcc-professor-talks-about-harassment-that-led-to-plan-to-kill-her/,"Kimberly Perez, groggy from sleep, answered her doorbell at 3:15 a.m. and stared her would-be assassin in the eyes.
“May I help you?” she asked politely, thinking it was someone in trouble.
The man with the baseball cap began shuffling his feet, as if unsure of himself. Perez recalls exactly what he said next:
“I have some information you might want to know. Someone wants to kill you or someone in your family.”
Whatever sleep may have been left in Perez quickly disappeared.
She blurted, “You have the wrong house or you got the wrong girl.”				
Then he said her name and told her which massage therapist and gym she frequents.
Sufficiently frightened, Perez raised her arm and slid her hand on top of the alarm system plate next to the door. Even though she knew it wasn’t operating, her first instinct was to try to scare him.				
The man said something vague about being there to help her and then turned and left.
The bizarre events that unfolded from there have since led to the arrests and convictions of the man at her door, a colleague of Perez’s at Tidewater Community College, and a third man, all linked to a murder-for-hire plot against Perez.
For the first time outside of court appearances, Perez is speaking publicly about her ordeal with the hope that she can prevent it from happening to someone else. She also recently filed a multimillion-dollar lawsuit against TCC officials who she says ignored her complaints.
The daughter of a military mom, Perez, now 36, never really had a permanent home growing up. She lived up and down the East Coast, and after graduating from college and getting a master’s degree, she worked in Japan, England and Turkey. She married a Turkish man, but that didn’t work out.
She said she decided to live in Virginia Beach by closing her eyes and pointing at a map. She’s been a TCC professor for about eight years.
Her ordeal began in February 2006 at a dinner celebrating the birthday of Perez’s supervisor at TCC, Jay A. Glosser. Both taught classes in information systems technology.
Until that dinner, Perez said she believed she had a strictly platonic, friendly and professional relationship with Glosser, who was married and had children. But that night, Glosser reached his hand under the table and placed it on Perez’s knee.
Perez made it clear to Glosser that she had no romantic feelings for him and that his behavior was inappropriate. He apologized profusely, she said, and he assured her it would not happen again.
A month later, while at dinner across the street from the downtown Norfolk campus, Glosser professed his love for Perez and told her he was leaving his wife. He asked her if she was dating anyone.
“I told him that made me uncomfortable,” she said. She demanded that he cease such talk. Again, he promised he would.
But he didn’t.
Perez would soon learn that Glosser knew about her medical appointments, her massage schedule and the friends she kept outside of work. He left her notes and flowers and messages on her answering machine. She says she believed he was stalking her.
“I can’t sleep thinking about you,” he said in one phone message, left after midnight on April 8, 2006.
Two days later, Perez reported the incidents to her dean. She said she heard nothing back.
On April 26, 2006, Jimmy Peterson, a TCC dean at the time, called Perez into his office to explain a print-out of a MySpace page that had her photo and a sexually explicit poem on it. Peterson told her Glosser had been given the print-out by a student, who claimed to have found it in a computer lab, she said.
She accused Glosser of fabricating the page and again explained the continuing sexual harassment. Around that time, Perez also notified another dean, Joanne Diddlemeyer, and college Provost Quintin Bullock of the ongoing problems.
In the meantime, Perez said she had discovered that Glosser had been entering her office and rifling through her mail.
On May 4, 2006, Perez filed a written sexual harassment complaint with the college. A week later, she told the school officials that she no longer felt safe around Glosser. Through that month, she said the school did nothing to help her.
Then came the morning of June 1, 2006.
After the sun came up, it occurred to Perez that there might be a connection between the man who came to her door in the dark and Glosser. Her fears were confirmed when the man called her at 10:26 a.m., seven hours after appearing at her doorstep.
He told her he was hired to kill her. But he was reluctant, he told her, because he didn’t “do women and children,” Perez recalled him saying. He told her if she paid him $10,000 he wouldn’t kill her.
The same day, she reported the death threat to Diddlemeyer, who at the time was acting provost. She also reported it to police and hired a private investigator.
Over the next several days, Perez received more calls from the hit man. In one call, he told her he was connected to the Ku Klux Klan and that if he didn’t kill her, “some skinheads would come in from Alabama to do it,” she recalled him saying. He also informed her during one of the calls that she needed to drop the sexual harassment complaint, providing solid proof for her that Glosser was behind the plot.
She e-mailed Diddlemeyer, stating she could not come to campus for fear of her life. Despite her fears, on June 5, 2006, Diddlemeyer ordered Perez to report to campus for student labs.
The next day, the private investigator called the Virginia State Police and reported the murder plot. Within two hours, detectives were at her house planning a sting operation.
Perez called the hit man and arranged a meeting. She talked him down to $5,000 and agreed to provide a signed statement retracting the sexual harassment complaint. She told him she would place the items in a P.F. Chang’s takeout bag and drop it at an agreed-upon location.
She got him to agree to let her bring along a female companion, but he insisted there be no guns.
“I don’t want it to be a gun fight,” he told her.
“I was terrified,” she said. She recalled thinking, “Of all the things I’ve done in my life, how did I end up here?”
The companion was actually an undercover trooper. As Perez drove to the location, the hit man was talking to her on a cell phone, changing the location two or three times. The trooper, meanwhile, was on a walkie-talkie providing their constant location to other troopers following in unmarked cars.
They ended up at a parking lot near Sentara Leigh Hospital on Kempsville Road.
He yelled into the phone, “Throw the bag out the window.” She did, and sped off.
As the hit man pulled up to snatch the bag, which was filled with crumpled newspapers, troopers were immediately on top of him, with shotguns at his head.
The hit man identified himself as F. Devin Scott, a truck driver in his mid-30s who told the troopers that his boss, Raymond Groves, hired him to carry out the plot. Scott agreed to tape a phone call to Groves, which led to incriminating statements and Groves’ arrest. Groves then agreed to record phone calls to Glosser, and more incriminating statements were made.
Scott and Groves were later convicted in Virginia Beach Circuit Court. Scott is serving seven years in prison, and Groves is serving eight years. Glosser entered an Alford plea, in which he didn’t admit guilt but agreed that the prosecutors had enough evidence to find him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. He has since appealed.
The lawsuit filed by Perez is pending in U.S. District Court. TCC has not yet filed a response and has declined to comment on the matter.
Perez, meanwhile, is left living a life, she says, filled with fears and anxiety.
“I can’t got to the store without worrying that someone is following me,” she said. “It’s a different life.”
But she’s grateful to the troopers who helped her and her students and colleagues who supported her throughout.
“I don’t know how I did it. I know I had a guardian angel,” she said. “Internal fortitude comes from somewhere. You just do what you have to do.”

                                CHICAGO — A Truman College English professor has been charged with sexually assaulting a former student.
Max Gulias II, 45, was charged with criminal sexual assault in connection to the March 20 incident involving a 28-year-old woman.
That day, the two met at a bar before going to Gulias' apartment in the 1500 block of South Sangamon Street in the University Village neighborhood, prosecutors said.
The woman fell asleep before waking up and finding Gulias raping her, prosecutors said.
She later notified the building's security and was taken to University of Illinois-Chicago hospital, prosecutors said.
The woman was Gulias' student in 2007 and 2008. For a few weeks in 2011, the two dated, prosecutors said. The two re-established a dating relationship recently, prosecutors said.

        
                                            
Gulias turned himself in on Monday, prosecutors said. He was ordered held on $30,000 bail Wednesday.

                                Police arrested Khaled Habib, a computer science professor at Tulsa Community College's Metro campus, after prosecutors said he exposed himself to a student. Habib was arrested Wednesday and has bonded out of jail. The alleged victim told police Habib exposed himself last August but she didn't report it sooner because she was embarrassed. ""With the investigation law enforcement put together we felt that based upon the allegations provided by the victim, who at the time was 57 years old, those criminal charges were warranted,"" said Assistant District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler. The alleged victim told police she agreed to meet Habib at the computer lab for help on an assignment. She said he made her feel uncomfortable from the start and asked her personal questions. Court documents showed that she turned around to see Habib's pants pulled down as he was touching himself inappropriately. ""Just because it happens on a particular day doesn't mean the person is going to immediately report it,"" Kunzweiler said. The woman told police she only got the courage to come forward after hearing Habib was also being inappropriate with other students.FOX23 talked to one of Habib's neighbors who didn't want to believe the allegations.""We've known him. We've known their whole family. He's been in our home. I just have a hard time even thinking that it would be anything that would be true,"" the neighbor said.Tulsa Community College responded immediately and after we asked them about Habib's employment.They sent us this statement.""On June 24, a Tulsa Community College employee, who was formerly a student, notified the TCC Campus Police of concerns regarding possible misconduct of a sexual nature.  Our Campus Police investigated and turned the information gathered over to the Tulsa Police Department.  The TPD subsequently issued an arrest warrant for a TCC faculty member.  The faculty member is no longer with the College.  TCC continues to cooperate with the Tulsa Police Department related to this complaint.We are grateful that our employee came forward and that our TCC Campus Police responded in an effective manner.  We are committed to assisting the TPD in any way that successfully concludes their investigation.

A U.S. congresswoman is calling out a leading astronomy educator who violated the sexual harassment policy at the University of Arizona, saying the case highlights a larger problem of holding known offenders accountable in higher education.The astronomer, Timothy Frederick Slater, now holds a prestigious position at the University of Wyoming, where he conducts research and mentors graduate students. But a 2004 investigation at Arizona concluded that Slater created a hostile work environment by regularly subjecting students and employees to unwanted sexual conduct — such as gifting a student a cucumber-shaped vibrator, going to strip clubs for lunch and openly commenting on women’s bodies.Slater, who remained at Arizona for four years after the investigation, admitted in an interview with Mashable on Sunday that he violated the sexual harassment policy at the university but said that he has since reformed.Even though the events in question happened more than a decade ago, the case highlights a more publicly stated concern among scientists recently that sexual impropriety is a problem in the scientific community, and specifically in astronomy, a field long dominated by men.
A recent scandalSlater may be the third space scientist to be publicly accused of sexual harassment in recent months.The field was recently rocked by allegations of sexual misconduct by Geoffrey Marcy, a noted exoplanet hunter at University of California at Berkeley, whose name had been floated as a contender for a Nobel Prize in Physics.On Jan. 5, officials at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena announced that one of its faculty members had recently committed “unambiguous gender-based harassment” of two graduate students. A spokeswoman for CalTech, citing “privacy issues,” declined to comment further, but hours after this story was published, Science magazine reported the person was Christian Ott, a professor of theoretical astrophysics who studies gravitational waves.

The Slater case now raises questions about how such complaints are handled and shared when faculty and staff move to new institutions, as Slater did when he joined the University of Wyoming in 2008.In a letter sent to the U.S. Department of Education on Monday, Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif. cited the Slater case and called on the department’s civil rights office to “clarify” whether reports of misconduct must be disclosed when they move to a different institution.“The Slater case, while lurid, is just a symptom of a much larger problem — how to prevent harassment, and effectively deal with it when it occurs,” the letter said. “In some ways, the situation is reminiscent of the Catholic Church’s coddling of child-molesting priests. As in the Church, universities protect perpetrators with slap-on-the-wrist punishment and secrecy, while victims are left alone to try to put their academic careers and lives back together.”In a speech on the House of Representatives’ floor Tuesday, Speier said she planned to introduce legislation to require schools to share information about disciplinary proceedings.When violators move between schools, the university they are moving to should be aware of their past conduct, Speier said.“Students enter astronomy to study the stars, not their professor’s sex life.”A spokeswoman for the Department of Education said it received the letter and looked “forward to responding as we continue our efforts to ensure that all students are able to learn in environments free from sexual harassment.”‘Fundamental flaw’“The University of Arizona did what it was supposed to do in investigating and ending activities that had created a sexually hostile workplace in 2004,” a university official said in a statement provided to Mashable on Monday. “Following an extensive investigation, the university made a finding that its policy prohibiting a discriminatory workplace had been violated, took appropriate personnel actions, and ended the harassment.”The University of Wyoming confirmed in a statement that officials inquired about “an allegation of sexual harassment” but found “no barriers to UW hiring Dr. Slater.” Multiple sources said that the University of Wyoming never saw or received the report that came out of Arizona’s investigation.

“It wouldn’t be released but it would be discussed,” the Arizona spokesman said. “And in this case, I believe it was.”However, Joan Schmelz, a physics professor at the University of Memphis and chair of the American Astronomical Society’s Committee on the Status of Women in Astronomy from 2009 to 2015, said the Slater case “exposes a fundamental flaw in the current system.”How could Slater, she asked, “start a new job at the University of Wyoming with a clean slate?”Slater later posted a statement on a website regarding the Arizona investigation.One person, responding to Slater’s online statement, called on prominent science organizations to cut ties with the Slaters’ group, which focuses on science education.Seriously, @nasa, @theAGU, and @BlackPhysicists -- you are listed as partners on this organization's website. You should strongly reassess.— Ashlee Wilkins (@ashleenwilkins) January 11, 2016Slater speaksIn a hours-long phone conversation on Sunday with Slater and his wife, Stephanie, Slater said he received sexual harassment and management training after the investigation.“What I can say is that the sexual harassment training worked really well for me,” Slater said. “I can say that one of the things I realized in the sexual harassment training is that science can be a real tough place for women.”“I think the most important lesson for me has been that you’ve got to have really strong boundaries between your personal and your professional life,” he added. “If I was going to do anything differently, I think I’d have been more careful about that.”Stephanie Slater, a prominent physics and astronomy education researcher in her own right, said the allegations had resurfaced due to “hysteria” in the astronomy community.“Many of us in the astronomy community are sort of worried about the witch hunt that’s going on post-Marcy,” she said. “I’m not apologizing for Geoff Marcy. But I am saying that the process was illegitimate, and it’s having a quite chilling effect in our community.”The Slaters said that while they knew about Speier’s plans to publicize the case, they had not been contacted by the congresswoman’s office.“It seems odd to me that a legislator will release a document without at least talking to the people that the document is about or at least getting permission from the University of Arizona to do so,” Timothy Slater said.“We would love to sue the bejesus off a congresswoman who has violated a witnesses’ confidentiality rights by distributing a confidential document,” Stephanie Slater said.

In October, when BuzzFeed reported that Marcy, a prominent exoplanet hunter at the UC Berkeley, had sexually harassed students for years, the story made public a broader issue that had long been discussed more privately within the astronomy and planetary science community.The problem of sexual harassment isn’t just limited to astronomy. In a study published in 2014, 64 percent of the more than 600 respondents from scientific fields said they have been sexually harassed while doing field work.Top researchers can wield a lot of power in their specific fields as they can control access to grant money and jobs, people in the community have said.A survey presented at a major astronomy conference in Florida last week suggested that sexual harassment is an ongoing problem in space science.While“I would like to have people think about what we’ve lost in science because of the students who’ve been basically pushed out of the field because they have nowhere to go after having been harassed by an adviser,” astronomer Meg Urry, president of the American Astronomical Society, said during the presentation. “It’s an extraordinary amount of damage.”‘I want to get you naked’Slater began his career as a Kansas high school science teacher in 1989 and has since become one of the most renowned names in astronomy education. Slater said that, over the course of his career, he has received more than $30 million in federally funded grants, and in developing the curriculum for a new generation of astronomy teachers, has received several awards and prestigious appointments.In 1996, he took a job as a physics professor at Montana State University, where he founded the Conceptual Astronomy and Physics Education Research (CAPER) program that his wife Stephanie today runs as an independent nonprofit. In 2001, he was hired as an astronomy professor at the University of Arizona.Officials there launched an investigation into Slater in 2004 after several people approached the administration to discuss “sexually charged conduct they were experiencing in the College of Astronomy and Steward Observatory,” according to the report documenting the inquiry.

Interviews with several of Slater’s former colleagues and the Slaters themselves corroborated many of the details described in the report.Officials interviewed at least 10 witnesses who worked with Slater and told investigators that he routinely made lewd jokes and behaved inappropriately. Investigators described a work environment where sexual innuendo was frequent and tolerated and boundaries were often blurred. Slater and another senior member of his lab often invited graduate students to lunch and lap dances at strip clubs and even gave students sex toys — such as chocolate handcuffs and the cucumber-shaped vibrator — as gifts.One woman who worked for Slater told investigators that he regularly told her that “she would teach better if she did not wear underwear.” Once, she said, “he grabbed her underwear through her dress, stretched it and snapped it, and said ‘You’d look a whole lot better without these on.’”The woman also told investigators that she once complained to Slater that the room they were working in was too cold. Slater, the woman said, responded by looking “at her breasts and comment[ing] that he thought ‘they’ were supposed to get hard and stand out when they were cold, and that it must not be too cold.”On other occasions, she said, Slater told her: “I want to get you naked” and “Stand up, turn around — half the boys in your class are going home to masturbate after watching you teach.”The report mentions one of Slater’s colleagues — identified in the report as “Witness J” — whom Mashable was able to identify as Edward E. Prather, a postdoctoral researcher who ran CAPER with Slater.One witness identified as “Witness H” told investigators that Prather “seemed to encourage Dr. Slater in his sexual behavior.”‘Returned to good standing’In their statement on Sunday, the Slaters named Prather as someone who was also investigated and found to have violated the school’s sexual harassment policy.Prather, now a tenured professor at the University of Arizona’s College of Astronomy and executive director of its Center for Astronomy Education, did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Chris Sigurdson, a spokesman for the University of Arizona, confirmed to Mashable that Prather was also investigated.“He was given remedial and corrective actions to complete,” Sigurdson said. “Once those were done — fulfilled, he was returned to good standing with the expectation that he would never repeat the violation.”Investigators also examined whether Slater retaliated against witnesses by firing them or cutting their funding. At least two women — witnesses “B” and “D” — said they believed he retaliated against them after suspecting them of triggering the school’s sexual harassment review. Ultimately, the report did not find that retaliation had occurred.Officials were more conclusive on the harassment claim, however, writing at the time that “there is substantial evidence that Dr. Slater’s sexual conduct was ongoing,” and “probably occurring more than once every day.”In his own comments to investigators, Slater said he was “probably inappropriate sometimes” and confirmed several particular details, including the report that he once gave a female graduate student “a pickle or cucumber-shaped vibrator at a ‘pre-marriage’ party.” However, he denied other claims, such as “discussing blow jobs” or “physically snapping a female’s underwear through her dress.”Such conduct, he said, “crossed a line that he successfully maintains.”The investigators were not persuaded and concluded that “given Dr. Slater’s admitted record of conduct, it is in no way outside the bounds of reasonable conjecture that these incidents could well have occurred.”Slater continued working at the university until 2008.‘A smear campaign’Slater left the University of Arizona for the University of Wyoming, where he holds an endowed chair for excellence in higher education.The report documenting the alleged sexual misconduct was confidential at the time of his hire, but it resurfaced at the end of 2015.In November, Pamela L. Gay, an astronomer at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, got hold of the report. Gay told Mashable that someone sent it to her anonymously in the hopes that she could bring it to light, and that she subsequently spoke to at least one person familiar with the investigation.

Sigurdson, the Arizona spokesman, authenticated the report and said it was released by the school’s public records office “by mistake” in 2010.Gay also emailed colleagues at the International Astronomical Union, where she serves on a committee, warning them about more “problems since he got to Wyoming.”Gay’s complaint prompted a lengthy exchange between the Slaters and the IAU, which ultimately declined to pursue her concerns. In a response dated Dec. 7, Slater admitted to “poor judgment” while at Arizona, but said that no complaints or investigations of sexual harassment had been lodged against him since and refused to suspend his work on the symposium.A University of Wyoming spokesman confirmed that the university “has not received any complaints of civil rights discrimination against Dr. Slater, nor has it opened any investigations.”Citing a 2006 performance review at Arizona, his initial vetting at Wyoming and a 2014 department-wide investigation of racial discrimination, Slater wrote that “it would not be a large exaggeration to say that I have been subject to more instances of scrutiny than any other astronomy professor in the United States for more than a decade.”In his letter, Slater accused Gay of waging a jealousy-motivated “smear campaign.”“My wife, Stephanie, and I are admittedly very, very successful in our field, which causes more than a small amount of jealousy,” Slater wrote. “Dr. Gay and her comrades are our direct competitors, and have unfortunately engaged in this kind of gossip against us for years.”When the IAU declined to act, she said, she sent the report to journalists.“I did this when I realized that astronomy is currently not able to protect its community members from abuse, and that real change would only be possible with public and political pressure acting from the outside,” Gay said in an email.The Slaters have since threatened to sue Gay. On Wednesday, Timothy Slater filed a version of his letter as a sexual harassment complaint with Gay’s university, accusing her of violating its sexual harassment policy by making “frivolous and malicious sexual harassment charges” against him. The university dismissed the complaint against Gay.Miriam Kramer covers space science for Mashable. Contact her at [email protected]. Sergio Hernandez is a U.S.  World reporter at Mashable.

Speier said that one female grad student her office spoke with said she had to go to a strip club to discuss her academics with Slater.""Students enter astronomy to study the stars, not to study the professor's sex life,"" Speier said.Speier also published the university’s report detailing the allegations against Slater on her Congressional website.Slater filed suit in November for an unspecified amount against the Arizona Board of Regents, which controls the University of Arizona, for defamation and for violation of the state's open records law for releasing the report in the first place. Slater and his wife, Stephanie, also filed suit that month for over $33 million against Gay in Illinois for leaking a copy of the report to journalists and to Speier's office.The report's release made it ""impossible"" for him to advance in his career to become a highly-paid university vice president, Slater claims in his Arizona suit. Further, he alleges, his speaking engagements are drying up, colleagues and grad students no longer want to work with him on research, and a high-ranking NASA official told Slater that because of the report's release, future grant requests will probably be denied.While Slater acknowledges he violated the school's policy over a decade ago, it was limited to permitting a crude and crass workplace, and he insists the report is full of false accusations, the lawsuit against the University of Arizona says. After concluding its investigation, the university ordered Slater to take part in sexual harassment sensitivity training, but he remained on the job until 2008, when he was hired by the University of Wyoming for a prestigious position as an endowed chair.The University of Wyoming knew about his harassment case before it hired him. It decided the case presented “no barriers to [Slater's] hiring"" because that ""the matter had been resolved,"" according to Chad Baldwin, a University of Wyoming spokesman. However, Baldwin told BuzzFeed News, the school did not have access to the actual investigation report, which was first released in error by the University of Arizona in response to a 2010 records request from Mark Hammergren, an astronomer at the Adler Planetarium in Chicago. Two months after providing the report to Hammergren, the university sent him a letter in July 2010 asking him to “destroy any copies you have of it.”“The disclosure of this report was done so in error,” the university said in the letter, and it warned of “the chilling effect its release would have on future possible employee investigations.”It's unclear how the report remained in circulation between then and 2016, when Gay leaked it to journalists and to Speier. Gay and Hammergren declined to comment for this story.Slater is one of several high-profile figures in academia in recent years to be publicly accused of sexual harassment. In 2015, BuzzFeed News reported on how Geoff Marcy, a celebrated astronomer and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, had kept his job despite years of harassment allegations. Last month, BuzzFeed News reported that UC Berkeley officials knew that at least three students had made sexual misconduct claims against renowned philosophy professor John R. Searle before he was sued in March for harassing a young woman. The same week that Slater's past became public, a case of a tenured astrophysics professor at the California Institute of Technology, Christian Ott, came to light: The university found that Ott harassed two female students, and under the school's self-proclaimed ""zero tolerance"" for such behavior, it suspended him for nine months but also let him keep his job. Ott is due to return to his position in August, but some students are demanding he not be allowed back.Slater's lawsuit against the Arizona Board of Regents claims that the results of his investigative report should have been kept secret under state law.The Arizona regents' policy permits universities to disclose personnel records that are ""reasonably necessary to maintain an accurate knowledge of employee disciplinary actions,"" and it says only a report of a ""final disciplinary action"" should be made public. Slater contends the report on his case wasn't covered by public records law because it was not ""final,” said nothing about punishment, and contained allegations that were not substantiated.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2016/01/13/astronomys-snowballing-sexual-harassment-scandal-picks-up-even-more-cases/,"Add to your saved storiesSaveSexual harassment is everywhere – especially in the sciences. But astronomers are pushing back against the systemic problems in their field. On Tuesday, two new cases of sexual harassment in the academic world of astronomy came to light, making for three high-profile outings in as many months.In October, Buzzfeed News broke the story that Geoff Marcy – an astronomer frequently cited as a potential Nobel laureate – had been investigated by the University of California at Berkeley for violating the school's sexual harassment policy. The six-month-long investigation found several instances in which Marcy had been guilty of harassment, but he received only a warning – and students outside of the allegations were not informed of the investigation.On Tuesday, Buzzfeed's Azeen Ghorayshi reported another troubling story: Caltech astrophysicist Christian Ott was found to have violated school harassment policies with two different women working in his lab. Buzzfeed reports that Sarah Gossan, a former student in Ott's lab, filed a complaint with Caltech’s Title IX office when she ""realized that her deteriorating relationship with Ott was harming her work and emotional well-being."" Ott had drawn Gossan into frequent, emotional online chats  during which he confessed to her that he'd been in love with Io Kleiser, another of his students, who would eventually join Gossan in filing the complaint.According to the school's investigation and Ghorayshi's reporting, Ott expressed distress over his love for Kleiser, even posting 86 poems about the researcher on Tumblr – though Kleiser herself was unaware of his feelings. Kleiser was fired suddenly when Ott claimed to be disappointed and personally hurt by her lack of commitment to the lab, forcing her to find another adviser with whom to finish her degree. He revealed to Gossan that he'd fired Kleiser because he worried that her sexual sway over him was allowing her to slack off, despite her being unaware of his feelings.Caltech responded by suspending Ott and banning him from campus for a year, which was announced (without attaching his name or the details of the case) this month. “Because Christian still has a place at Caltech, I feel that I don’t,” Kleiser told BuzzFeed News. She's since left to finish her studies at Berkeley, but Gossan is finishing at Caltech – and may very well overlap with Ott's return to campus. “If they retain Christian and keep a place for him, then they may be inadvertently telling many students that those students do not have a place at Caltech,"" Kleiser said.Meanwhile, Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) named another astronomer during a speech Tuesday. The University of Wyoming's Timothy Frederick Slater was found in violation of the sexual harassment policy during his previous appointment at the University of Arizona. He allegedly commented on the appearances of women in his lab, held meetings in strip clubs and gave a vibrator to a female student as a gift, among other things. “Students enter astronomy to study the stars, not their professor’s sex life,"" Speier said during her presentation.Slater stayed at the University of Arizona for four years after the investigation, and he underwent training to improve his behavior. But Mashable reports that the University of Wyoming didn't receive or review the investigation against him before he was hired. He essentially moved there with a clean slate – and that's what Speier is trying to keep from happening in the future. She plans on introducing legislation that would make universities share these investigations.In an interview with Mashable, Slater and his wife (prominent academic Stephanie Slater) said that his reprimand and training had worked, and that he was reformed. Indeed, there are no cases against him at his current institution. Stephanie Slater blamed the spotlight shone on her husband on ""hysteria.""""Many of us in the astronomy community are sort of worried about the witch hunt that’s going on post-Marcy,” she told Mashable. “I’m not apologizing for Geoff Marcy. But I am saying that the process was illegitimate, and it’s having a quite chilling effect in our community.""But others in the field see it differently: Many astronomers say that harassment has been endemic in their field for decades, and that these cases are just the tip of the iceberg. At the 227th meeting of the American Astronomical Society last week, nipping harassment in the bud was one of the major topics up for discussion. Perhaps this isn't the worst year for astronomy, but the best. Perhaps this isn't a witch hunt, but a reckoning.In any case, it's clear that this isn't a problem that can be solved by bringing a handful of cases to light. It very well could be that astronomy's sexual harassment problem is no worse than any other field of academia, but there's obviously a problem. Either way, it's up to leaders in the field to set an example, making it clear to insiders and outsiders alike that harassment has no place on their turf.Correction: An earlier version of this post credited Buzzfeed with breaking news of the Caltech case. Ott's identity was in fact reported first by ScienceInsider on Tuesday, with Buzzfeed's in-depth report following shortly thereafter. "

An assistant professor in the University of Arizona’s college of public health parted ways with the school last week, after an internal investigation found that he sexually harassed a student last fall.On Sept. 29, the student filed a report with the UA’s Office of Institutional Equity accusing Nathan Stupiansky of drug-facilitated sexual assault.The Star does not typically identify victims of sexual assault.Earlier in the month, the woman met Stupiansky for a drink in downtown Tucson, but shortly after starting her second drink, the woman experienced a complete blackout that lasted several hours, the letter said.She woke up naked in a bed in an apartment belonging to Stupiansky’s friend, with no memory of what had happened. Stupiansky told the woman that he had sex with her in the time she’d been incapacitated and again in the morning when she was disoriented and still incapable of consent, according to the letter.
            In April, the UA emailed the woman, saying that it had completed its investigation and found that it was “more probable than not” that Stupiansky violated UA policy by kissing her when he knew or should’ve known she was incapable of consenting, according to a letter issued by the OIE.The letter says that the school recommended significant action be taken to address the policy violation, but didn’t specify what that discipline would be.In a second letter sent to the woman on Monday, Office of Institutional Equity director Kristen Klotz said that in relation to the investigation, determination and recommendation, Stupiansky “is no longer employed by or affiliated with” the UA.UA spokesman Chris Sigurdson told the Star that rules about personnel information prohibit him from disclosing the nature of Stupiansky’s departure from the school, even though UA officials have previously alerted the media to firings of employees accused of misconduct.Sigurdson did confirm that Stupiansky’s last day was June 30.Stupiansky’s attorney, Rick Lougee, disputed the university’s determination.“The University’s findings are in keeping with its policy of ‘Start by Believing’ and ignoring facts and evidence inconsistent with preconceived notions of guilt,” Lougee wrote in an email to the Star.Lougee said that he was told the Tucson Police Department’s investigation into the incident was closed, but TPD told the Star on Tuesday that the case is still open while detectives wait for additional forensic evidence, according to department spokesman Officer Christopher Hawkins.While the woman told the Star that she’s relieved Stupiansky is no longer with the UA, she said that the investigative process has been grueling.“They didn’t make the right finding based on my story,” she said of the university’s sexual harassment finding rather than sexual assault. “They didn’t offer me help, and the waiting was torture.”The woman filed a police report and submitted to a rape kit. She reported the situation to the UA a few weeks later, at which time officials told her it would take two to three months to complete the investigation, but it actually took nearly seven months before the school issued its finding.When she asked the school for legal resources, the woman was referred to legal aid, which turned her away, saying they don’t handle criminal cases. After months of waiting for the UA to return a decision, the woman hired an attorney to help navigate the process and put pressure on the school to take action.At one point, an OIE employee told her that the problem with the investigation was that she didn’t remember anything.A University of Arizona salary database shows that Stupiansky was being paid $100,000 a year as the school’s director of adolescent studies.Stupiansky previously worked at the Indiana University School of Medicine, with his research and training focusing on behavioral determinants of sexual health among adolescents, according to the UA’s website.

        "
https://casetext.com/case/cox-v-university-of-arkansas,"  WILLIAM WILSON JR., District Judge   Plaintiff brought suit against the University of Arkansas, its President Alan Sugg, Chancellor John White, Professor Mark Cory, and unnamed ""John Doe"" Defendants, alleging that she was sexually harassed in violation of both the United States and Arkansas Constitutions; Title IX; 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, 1988; and Ark. Code Ann. §§ 16-123-105,106, and 107; she also alleges state tort claims of breach of fiduciary duty, battery, outrage, and sexual abuse. Although the Motion to Dismiss filed by the other Defendants encompasses claims made against Dr. Cory (Doc. No. 16), he filed a separate Motion to Dismiss (Doc. No. 14).   I. Background     With the exceptions of the variations footnoted, the remaining background has been taken from Doc. No. 17.   During the fall of 2003, Defendant Dr. Mark Cory (""Dr. Cory"") invited Plaintiff, an undergraduate student of the University of Arkansas, to his home. Over the course of the evening, Dr. Cory made several verbal and physical advances to Plaintiff. He suggested that they have a  sexual relationship during the upcoming academic year. Plaintiff maintains that she left Dr. Cory's home feeling uncomfortable, and worried about his sexual proposal. Plaintiff asserts that she wanted to report the incident but did not know who to speak to at the University.        The University has had a policy prohibiting sexual harassment since ""at least 1994."" The University also employs Ms. Kathryn Fairchild (""Ms. Fairchild""), who serves as the Assistant Director of the Office of Affirmative Action and is responsible for investigating any allegations of discrimination. The University's sexual harassment policy, which applies to faculty, staff, and students, is published each year in multiple locations, including the Faculty Handbook, the Staff Handbook, the Undergraduate Student Handbook, and the Graduate Student Handbook — including the versions of these publications which were in force during the 2003-2004 academic year. These publications are available to all members of the University community through the University's website. The University's policy prohibiting sexual harassment is also available on the Office of Affirmative Action website.     See http://www.uark.edu/depts/ofaa/.   The University notes that it conducts training sessions every year through its Office of Affirmative Action with administrators, deans, department heads, faculty, staff, and students (primarily graduate students with teaching responsibilities) regarding the University's policy against sexual harassment. The Office of Affirmative Action and the Office of General Counsel also  provide sexual harassment training sessions for deans, department heads, program directors, and related administrators. Session attendees are asked to review the University's sexual harassment policy with faculty and staff within their department.   On April 16, 2004, Ms. Fairchild was contacted by the University's Office of Student Affairs. Student Affairs had been contacted by the father of an undergraduate student who alleged Dr. Cory had sexually harassed his daughter. In a telephone conversation with the student's father the same day, Ms. Fairchild learned that his daughter and at least four other students claimed Dr. Cory sexually harassed them. The father was certain that his daughter wished to make a formal complaint but would do so only after she had taken her last final. Ms. Fairchild advised the father that she needed to meet with his daughter immediately to avoid the possibility of any further misconduct. According to Defendants, the father would not agree, and suggested a meeting on May 10, 2004.   In their conversation, Ms. Fairchild learned that the other students were also reluctant to come forward, but that his daughter was attempting to convince them to do so. Despite Ms. Fairchild's efforts, the student's father would not provide any of the other student's names.   As promised, the student telephoned Ms. Fairchild on May 10, 2004, and they agreed to meet on May 12, 2004. During their meeting, the student recounted her story as well as the stories of some of the other students. The student never revealed the names of any of the other alleged victims. Nevertheless, based on their conversation, Ms. Fairchild knew that there were four other students who knew of each other's experiences with Dr. Cory. None of the other students reported Dr. Cory's inappropriate behavior before Ms. Fairchild's meeting with the initial student on May 12, 2004.    Within hours of Ms. Fairchild's meeting with the initial student, Plaintiff, Sarah Cox, contacted her. Ms. Fairchild had Plaintiff come to her office immediately. This meeting marked the first time that Plaintiff notified any ""university official with authority to take corrective action of any allegations of sexual harassment concerning Dr. Cory.""    In their meeting, Plaintiff recounted the events that she alleged occurred with Dr. Cory during the previous fall. According to Plaintiff, sometime in September 2003, Dr. Cory invited her to his home to work on her thesis. After working for a time, the two went for a walk in a nearby park. On a bridge at the park, Dr. Cory kissed Plaintiff and complimented her hair. They walked back to the house and Dr. Cory offered her coffee, and they looked at pictures. Dr. Cory's sexual overtures escalated until he eventually picked Plaintiff up and carried her to his bedroom where they undressed and got in bed together. A question exists as to whether the contact had been consensual up to that point. After Dr. Cory went to his bathroom to obtain a condom, Plaintiff told him that she wanted to leave. After some discussion, Plaintiff dressed and indicated that she was going to leave. Plaintiff maintains that Dr. Cory was upset and tried to get her to stay by hugging her and putting his hands on her breasts. Plaintiff left at this point.   After this incident, Plaintiff's contact with Dr. Cory was limited to a couple of meetings in his office and one email. Plaintiff noted that on at least one occasion, Dr. Cory gave her an uncomfortably long hug and suggested that they go away together for a weekend. Ms. Fairchild took down Plaintiff's version of events and mentioned that she was looking into other complaints against Dr. Cory.    On May 12, 2004, the father of the student with whom Ms. Fairchild had first met, faxed Ms. Fairchild his daughter's statement, made in the presence of an attorney. Although the statement was dated January 21, 2004, it was not furnished to Ms. Fairchild until May 12, 2004.   Between May 12-17, 2004, Ms. Fairchild communicated with Dean Donald Babbitt and Provost Bob Smith about the allegations against Dr. Cory. Neither had any previous knowledge of the alleged harassment. Ms. Fairchild met with Dr. Cory on May 18, 2004, and advised him of the charges that had been made by the first student that led her to meet Plaintiff. Dr. Cory was advised that he could voluntarily resign from his position, or Provost Smith would initiate termination proceedings against him and revoke his tenure. Dr. Cory opted to resign.   Dr. Cory was advised to avoid any contact with students and told that he would not be permitted to lead an upcoming overseas student trip. The day after the meeting, Dr. Cory submitted his letter of resignation, relinquishing his tenure rights effective June 30, 2004. The University accepted Dr. Cory's letter of resignation on May 20, 2004. Within eight days of Ms. Fairchild's first meeting with Plaintiff, Dr. Cory had resigned his position.   On May 21, 2004, Dr. Smith outlined the conditions of Dr. Cory's employment through his resignation date. Dr. Cory was directed to not have any contact with any current or former students with whom he had had personal relationships of any type or with whom he had sought to initiate such a relationship. Dr. Cory was advised that after his resignation, he could not seek or accept any employment or volunteer role that would place him in contact with University of Arkansas students. Dr. Cory was also required to come to Ms. Fairchild's office each Friday and document any contacts he had that week with former students.    On May 21, 2004, Ms. Fairchild renewed her efforts to obtain the names of other alleged victims. On May 24 and 25, 2005, Ms. Fairchild met with three other students who had complaints against Dr. Cory. Information regarding the other alleged victims has not been provided in this suit.   II. Standard of Review   Dismissal of a Complaint under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure is appropriate only when it ""appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the plaintiff's claim which would entitle him to relief."" A court must accept the allegations of the complaint as true and construe the complaint in favor of the plaintiff. The Complaint will be dismissed only if it appears that the plaintiff has failed to prove any facts in support of her claim which would entitle her to relief. A complaint should not be dismissed, nor a cause of action ignored, merely because the complaint does not state with precision all elements that give rise to a legal basis for recovery.       Springdale Education v. Springdale School, 133 F.3d 649 (8th Cir. 1998); R.W. Murray Co. v. Shatterproof Glass Corp., 697 F.2d 818, 821 (8th Cir. 1983).  III. Analysis   Dr. Cory suggests that Plaintiff only intended to bring suit against him for the tort claims of outrage, sexual abuse, and battery, but he is wrong. Plaintiff brought all claims against all Defendants with the exception of the three additional tort claims brought solely against Dr. Cory. As a student of the University of Arkansas School of Law in Fayetteville, Plaintiff has standing to seek equitable relief.    For ease of analysis, Plaintiff's alleged causes of action and requested damages made against all Defendants in their individual and official capacities are summarized as follows:     1. Violation of the Right of Association; First, Ninth, Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; requests money damages.    2. Sexual Harassment Discrimination; Equal Protection Due Process; Ninth Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution; requests money damages.    3. Sexual Harassment Discrimination; Title IX of the Education Amendments, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681- 1686; requests money damages.    4. 42 U.S.C. § 1983     a. Failure to Come to the Aid; requests money damages.    b. Failure to Properly Train; requests both money damages and requirement to properly train Defendants who violated Plaintiff's rights.    c. Failure to Investigate, Discipline, Correct, or Supervise; requests both money damages and requirement to investigate Defendants who violated Plaintiff's rights.    d. Improper Approval and/or Ratification of Dr. Cory's conduct; requests money damages.    e. Failure to Create or Maintain Proper Formal Polices Procedures; requests both money damages and requirement to enact adequate sexual harassment procedures.    f. Inadequate Policies, Procedures, Customs, Usages; requests both money damages and requirement to enact adequate sexual harassment procedures.    5. Conspiracy under 42 U.S.C. § 1985; requests money damages.    6. Sexual Harassment Discrimination; Equal Protection Due Process; Article II, Sections 3, 13, 18, 21, and 29 of the Arkansas Constitution; requests money damages.    7. Sexual Harassment Discrimination; Ark. Code Ann. §§ 16-123-105-16-123-107; requests money damages.    8. Breach of Fiduciary Duty; requests money damages. Plaintiff also raises the state law tort claims of outrage, sexual abuse, and battery against Dr. Cory.    In her response to Defendants' Motion to Dismiss, Plaintiff makes several concessions:     • Plaintiff admits that her Title IX claim against Dr. Sugg, Dr. White, and John Does should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.     • Plaintiff admits that the University is protected via the Eleventh Amendment and Article 5, Section 20 of the Arkansas Constitution from suit under Ark. Code Ann. § 16-123-105, 106, or 107.    • Plaintiff concedes that she has presented no evidence to support a conspiracy claim under § 1985 against any of the Defendants.    • Plaintiff concedes that Arkansas Statutes of Limitations for battery and sexual abuse bar her claims against Dr. Cory.         Additionally, because Dr. Cory was no longer employed by the University at the time suit was brought, he cannot be sued in his official capacity. All causes of action raised against Dr. Cory in his official capacity are DISMISSED.    A. Eleventh Amendment Sovereign Immunity   In their Motion to Dismiss, Defendants principal argument is that they are immune from suit under the Eleventh Amendment. In particular, Defendants maintain that any claim for monetary damages is barred against all Defendants sued in their official capacity as well as against the University.   The Eleventh Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that the judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced, or prosecuted against one of the United States by citizens of another state, or by citizens or subjects of any foreign state. In determining the applicability of the Eleventh Amendment to the political subdivisions of the state, this Court must,    [e]xamine the particular entity in question and its powers and characteristics as created by state law to determine whether the suit is in reality a suit against the state. Courts typically look at the degree of local autonomy and control and most importantly whether the funds to pay any award will be derived from the state treasury.          ""Each state university . . . must be considered on the basis of its own particular circumstances"" in determining if the university is a state instrumentality that enjoys the protection of the Eleventh Amendment. As of 1985, the Eighth Circuit determined that the majority of cases addressing the question of Eleventh Amendment immunity for public colleges and universities held that these institutions are arms of their respective state governments and immune from suit. The Greenwood Court opted not to make the final determination whether the University of Arkansas was immune from suit and remanded the case for that determination. The District Court held that the University of Arkansas is immune from suits for damages under the Eleventh Amendment. This ruling has not been superceded.       Id. ( quoting Hall v. Medical College, 742 F.2d 299, 301 (6th Cir. 1984) (Ohio); see United Carolina Bank v. Board of Regents, 665 F.2d 553, 561 (5th Cir. 1982) (Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas); Rutledge v. Arizona Board of Regents, 660 F.2d 1345, 1349-50 (9th Cir. 1981) (Arizona State University), aff'd sub nom. Kush v. Rutledge, 460 U.S. 719 (1983); Jagnandan v.

Richardson, 525 F.2d 74, 79 (6th Cir. 1975) (Memphis State University); Brennan v. University of Kansas, 451 F.2d 1287, 1290 (10th Cir. 1971); Walstad v. University of Minnesota Hospitals, 442 F.2d 634, 641-42 (8th Cir. 1971).  Contra Goss v. San Jacinto Junior College, 588 F.2d 96, 98 (5th Cir.), modified, 595 F.2d 1119 (1979); Dyson v. Lavery, 417 F.Supp. 103, 108 (E.D. Va. 1976) (Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University); Gordenstein v. University of Delaware, 381 F.Supp. 718, 725 (D. Del. 1974).   Greenwood v. Ross, 1988 WL 156151 (E.D. Ark. January 29, 1988).   The Eleventh Amendment bars federal suits against public servants in their official capacities when the ""state is the real, substantial party in interest."" The Eleventh Amendment, however, does not bar suits against a public servant in his official capacity when he is alleged to have committed an unconstitutional act because the State has no authority to order such acts and the official is therefore ""stripped of his official or representative character."" Even in such cases, only injunctive relief is permitted because retroactive relief would have a direct impact on the state treasury. In the present case, with the exception of her § 1983 claims, Plaintiff requests only money damages. Accordingly, the Eleventh Amendment bar on Plaintiff's federal and state law claims for money damages requires DISMISSAL of the causes of action against Defendants sued in their official capacity and against the University.      Pennhurst State School Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89,100-02.   Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. 651, 666-67 (1974) (holding that a suit against a state official for violation of federal law may only seek injunctive relief governing the official's future conduct); Assad-Faltas v. University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, 708 F. Supp. 1026, 1029-1030 (E.D. Ark. 1989); Slaughter v. Levine, 801 F.2d 288 (8th Cir. 1986).   B. Qualified Immunity   The Eleventh Amendment does not bar compensatory damages or punitive damages against actors sued in their individual capacities. In fact, state officers are personally liable for their conduct if sued in an individual capacity. Nevertheless, public officials are entitled to qualified  immunity ""insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known."" Immunity serves the public interest by avoiding the social costs of subjecting public officials to the burdens of litigation on insubstantial claims. Accordingly, it provides the official with immunity from suit rather than merely a defense to liability.         In the Complaint, Plaintiff alleges that ""Defendants tolerated, allowed, permitted, condoned, and/or approved of inadequate policies, procedures, customs, and/or usages that resulted int he violation of Cox's civil and/or constitutional rights. . . ."" Regarding Dr. Sugg and Dr. White, Plaintiff alleged that their ""acts and/or omissions amounted to deliberate indifference and also constituted negligence and/or were intentional.""     Whether an official should be granted qualified immunity for particular conduct is a question of law. The standard for addressing qualified immunity at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage is whether immunity is established on the face of the complaint. Although it has been held that qualified immunity should be addressed as soon as possible, without the benefit of discovery, it is impossible  to determine from the allegations presented whether or not qualified immunity should apply. Accordingly, Plaintiff has presented sufficient facts to overcome the motion to dismiss. This matter might be better addressed in a summary judgment motion. Even if I were to find that qualified immunity protects Defendants in their individual capacities, they would still be susceptible to prospective relief because claims for declaratory or injunctive relief are not subject to the qualified immunity defense.       Forsyth, 471 U.S. at 528.    Eleventh Amendment immunity for public servants sued in their official capacity is not overridden by § 1983 because Congress did not expressly so provide. Nevertheless, Defendants may still be liable to the Plaintiff for prospective relief. In light of Eleventh Amendment immunity and the fact that its primary purpose is to protect state treasuries, prospective injunctive relief would be the only remedy available to a plaintiff for a defendant who, acting in his official capacity, allegedly commits unconstitutional actions in violation of § 1983.     School district officials can be liable under § 1983 if they are deliberately indifferent to acts committed by a teacher that violate a student's constitutional rights. The plaintiff must show that the district officials received notice of a pattern of unconstitutional acts, demonstrated deliberate  indifference to the acts, failed to take sufficient remedial action, and that such failure proximately caused the injury to the students.     See Jane Doe A v. Special Sch. Dist. of St. Louis County, 901 F.2d 642, 645 (8th Cir. 1990).   A heightened pleading standard is applied to suits seeking § 1983 damages against government officials. The pleading must contain enough specificity to give a defendant notice of the nature of the claim, so he can respond and move for judgment on the basis of qualified immunity if applicable. Because I must construe the Complaint in the light most favorable to the Plaintiff, I must reject Defendant's 12(b)(6) argument at this point. It may be that the issue can be more appropriately addressed in a motion for summary judgment.     Defendants next argue that they cannot be sued in their official capacity under § 1983 because they are not ""persons"" contemplated by § 1983 against whom a suit can be sustained for money damages. A suit against a state official in his or her official capacity is not a suit against the official but rather is a suit against the official's office. It is no different from a suit against the State itself. ""A state official in his or her official capacity, when sued for injunctive relief, would be a person under § 1983 because `official-capacity actions for prospective relief are not treated as  actions against the State.'"" State officers may also be held personally liable for money damages under § 1983 based upon actions taken in their official capacities.       State officials, sued in their individual capacities, are ""persons"" within the meaning of § 1983. Unlike official-capacity defendants — who are not ""persons"" because they assume the identity of the government that employs them — officers sued in their personal capacity come to the court as individuals and thus fit comfortably within the statutory term ""person."" The Eleventh Amendment does not bar § 1983 personal-capacity suits against state officials in federal court.   It is well established in that the University is not a person within the meaning of § 1983. On the other hand, although prospective relief awarded against a state officer also ""implicate[s] Eleventh Amendment concerns,"" the interests in ""end[ing] a continuing violation of federal law,"" outweigh the interests in state sovereignty and justify an award under § 1983 of an injunction that operates against the state's officers or even directly against the state itself.     Dr. Sugg, Dr. White, and Dr. Cory can be held responsible for money damages under § 1983 in their individual capacities. Neither the Eleventh Amendment nor the doctrine of respondeat superior  protect Defendants from liability under § 1983. As noted above, the Plaintiff's pleadings are sufficient to withstand a 12(b)(6) motion. The University is not considered a person under § 1983 and is, therefore, DISMISSED.    D. Remaining Causes of Action   As an alternative argument to sovereign and qualified immunity, Defendants make a blanket argument that the remaining causes of action should be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. In the same manner that Defendants accuse Plaintiff of making cursory arguments to support her allegations, Defendants argue that her arguments are insufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss. As previously mentioned, it is enough at this stage of the suit for Plaintiff to allege that all Defendants were aware of the harassment and did not act quickly enough to protect her. Accordingly, Defendants' motion to dismiss the remaining claims is DENIED.   IV. Conclusion   In sum, the claims against the University and Dr. Cory in his official capacity are DISMISSED. With the exception of the § 1983 claims for prospective relief brought against Dr. Sugg and Dr. White in their official capacity, they are DISMISSED. The U.S. and Arkansas Constitutional claims as well as the breach of fiduciary duty claim brought against Defendants in their individual capacities remain. Also, the outrage claim brought against Dr. Cory individually remains.   IT IS SO ORDERED.     "

                                                            When a UB student began an affair with a senior UB staffer in August 2016, she thought it would just be a fun story to tell at her bachelorette party one day.
But she became pregnant, the consensual relationship ended in June and she reported it to the university in August. She and the staffer – Patrick Crosby, a senior adviser in the Educational Opportunity Program – had sex in his office on multiple occasions, and he sent her sexually suggestive photos and videos taken in his office during work time, she told UB officials.

                                

                                “I was in his office all the time and nobody said anything to me,” said the student, who wishes to remain anonymous. “I could have come in a clown suit and an AK-47, and no one would have noticed. I was very clearly not a freshman. I was very clearly not a part of EOP.”
UB removed Crosby from his job as counselor and put him on “special assignment,” which allowed him to work from home until last month. He resigned April 21.
Then, St. Bonaventure University hired Crosby as an academic adviser in its higher educational opportunity program. UB told the school he had been laid off for “budgetary reasons” and did not disclose the situation with the student, according to Tom Missel, interim vice president of university relations at St. Bonaventure. UB spokesperson John Della Contrada could not say what UB told St. Bonaventure.
UB’s policy is to confirm a former worker’s dates of employment when called by potential employers, according to Della Contrada.
Faculty and staff are allowed to have relationships with students as long as there is no conflict of interest, according to UB’s nepotism policy. The university also prohibits “unwelcome” sexual conduct.
Della Contrada declined to comment on Crosby’s case but provided a statement to The Spectrum that read, in part, “As a matter of practice, the university does not comment on individual personnel issues. Unwelcome sexual or romantic propositions and other forms of unwelcome sexual conduct are prohibited under university policies prohibiting sexual harassment.”

                                

                                                                                                    Tracy Johnson, assistant vice provost of educational affairs, also declined to comment.
Crosby, who had been at UB since July of 2016, declined to comment on the pictures he sent from his office. He said, “I wholeheartedly regret and am saddened by the difficulties and pain that I’ve caused my loved ones and those who support me.”
“Though my actions were unfavorable, she was a consenting adult and I violated no UB policy in my relationship with this student since there was no power dynamic; she was not a student of mine while at the university,” Crosby said in the statement. “Our relationship was very separate from any and all professional role[s] I held at the university.”
Crosby used two apps, Kik and Telegram, to communicate with the student, she said. She would go to his office a few times a week for lunch and more than once to have sex.
                                                                                                        
                                “I would just walk in and open his door,” she said.
When she came to UB, Crosby was the only familiar person to her, she said. The student met Crosby at Buffalo State College where he was her counselor for COMPASS, a college mentoring opportunity program.
When the student reported the situation and provided the videos and photos to Title IX Coordinator Sharon Nolan-Weiss in August, the university made sure she and Crosby had no further contact, the student said. The university, according to emails the student supplied to The Spectrum, told Crosby in September he wasn’t allowed to be in contact with students after September while he worked from home.
UB’s nepotism policy was last revised in 2015. Nolan-Weiss declined to talk to The Spectrum for this story.
UB’s policy focuses on the type of relationships between employees and students and if they involve conflicts of interest or unequal power relationships. If neither exists, the relationship is allowed, and faculty and staff, including advisers, do not have to report a consensual relationship. Officials said a conflict would involve coercion or a professor, adviser or staff member having a supervisory or evaluative role over a student. The university does not keep track of the number of relationship cases between staff and students unless someone reports a conflict, officials said.
In the past 10 years, universities nationwide have reevaluated and updated policies governing relationships between faculty, staff and undergraduate students. Harvard, Stanford, Yale, the University of Connecticut, and the College of William and Mary all prohibit sexual or romantic relationships between staff, faculty and students. In March, the University of Pennsylvania updated its policy to prohibit all sexual relations between faculty, staff, advisers and undergraduate students.
The hashtag #MeToo movement in the past year has also sparked new conversations about sexual dynamics and relationships in the workplace, including at universities.
Stanford’s policy says relationships have the potential to involve bias, favoritism and exploitation, and may have adverse effects on the school’s work environment during the relationship or post-breakup. It also says the relationships could “erode trust” in mentee-mentor relationships.
                                The College of William and Mary’s policy says the prohibition is to protect students and the “integrity of the university.”
UB is hesitant about revising its policy to prohibit all relationships between staff and students, but it’s something officials say is being discussed. The student said she was surprised that UB’s policy allowed her relationship, but she said sneaking around wasn’t hard.
“This is an example of a completely inappropriate relationship that should have never happened,” the student said. “And this is pretty bad, but our school is practically a mini-city and there’s definitely girls who’ve experienced more and greater terrible things that happen. They need to say something and not be embarrassed [to come forward].”
St. Bonaventure University hired Crosby as an academic counselor in the Higher Educational Opportunity Program on April 23 and suspended him on April 30, after learning of his relationship with the UB student, according to Missel. Missel said UB told St. Bonaventure upon Crosby’s hiring that Crosby was “laid off due to budgetary purposes.”
St. Bonaventure is “investigating” Crosby’s case, Missel said.
Correction: The original article stated the relationship began in June.

http://www.dailycal.org/2015/04/12/uc-berkeley-vice-chancellor-for-research-resigns-after-sexual-harassment-allegations/,"UC Berkeley Vice Chancellor for Research Graham Fleming has resigned after allegations arose that he sexually harassed a former campus employee.
Chancellor Nicholas Dirks informed faculty and campus leadership in research of the resignation Thursday evening, according to campus spokesperson Dan Mogulof. Fleming resigned for what he described as personal reasons and will end his term April 20.
Mogulof said he did not have further comment on Fleming’s reasons for resigning. According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Fleming was accused last year by former assistant vice chancellor for research enterprise services Diane Leite of violating the university’s anti-sexual harassment policies by allegedly inappropriately touching her and sending overly affectionate emails.
The Chronicle reported that the UC Office of the President investigated the allegations and found evidence that Fleming’s behavior may have been inappropriate. In a letter to the chancellor, Fleming criticized the investigation, according to the Chronicle. A public relations consultant working with his lawyer also told the Chronicle that Fleming denies the allegations.
Fleming joined the campus in 1997 as a chemistry professor. His achievements include helping propose and plan the construction of Stanley Hall and contributing to more than 400 publications. Before serving as vice chancellor of research, he served as the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory’s deputy director from 2005 to 2007.
As vice chancellor for research, he was responsible for leadership in policy, planning and administration related to campus research.
Leite was fired in 2012 for allegedly violating the university’s sexual harassment policies when she increased the salary of an employee with whom she was having a sexual relationship. Before being fired, Leite was notified by Fleming that she would be demoted and have her pay docked from $188,531 to $175,000.

		On April 11th 2016, I contacted the Office for Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination at UC Berkeley to report that Professor Terry Speed had sexually harassed a postdoctoral researcher in the UC Berkeley statistics department in the period 2000–2002. Two specific allegations were subsequently investigated:
Allegation One: Respondent, a professor in the Statistics Department, sexually harassed Complainant One, a post-doctoral student in the same department, from 2000-2002 by making sexual advances toward her, asking her for dates, telling her he had a “crush” on her, giving her hugs, and communicating with her, including by email, in an intimate or romantic manner, when such behavior was not welcome.
Allegation Two: Respondent, a professor in the Statistics Department, created a hostile work environment for Complainant Two, an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics Department, in 2002, through Respondent’s persistent discussions and emails regarding his romantic interest in Complainant One and by pressuring Complainant Two to persuade Complainant One to interact with Respondent.
The investigation took 14 months to complete, and the result was a 47 page report along with 89 pages of supporting evidence based on interviews, hundreds of pages of emails that I disclosed at the outset of the investigation, and letters and emails provided by Respondent. The report concludes as follows:
CONCLUSION
For the reasons stated above, I conclude that the preponderance of the evidence substantiates that Respondent violated the 1992 Sexual Harassment Policy in that he engaged in unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature that created a hostile environment for Complainant One and Complainant Two, and conditioned an academic or personnel decision on Complainant One’s submission to his conduct. This report is being submitted to the Vice Provost for Faculty for review under the Faculty Code of Conduct.
I have waited since June of last year to hear from the Vice Provost for Faculty at UC Berkeley what action the university will take in light of the findings, however despite multiple requests for information the university has yet to respond as to whether it will enact any sanctions on Respondent.
My close-up encounter with sexual harassment was devastating. I never expected, when I arrived in Berkeley in 1999, that Terry Speed, a senior professor in my field who I admired and thought of as a mentor would end up as Respondent and myself as Complainant Two. However much more serious and significant than my ordeal were the devastating consequences his sexual harassment had on the life and well being of Complainant One. The sexual harassment that took place was not an isolated event. Despite repeated verbal and written requests by Complainant One that Speed stop, his sexual harassment continued unabated for months. The case was not reported at the time the sexual harassment happened because of the structure of Title IX. Complainant One knew that Speed would be informed if a complaint was made, and Complainant One was terrified of reprisal. Her fear was not hypothetical; after months of asking Speed to stop sexually harassing her, he communicated to her that, unless she was willing to reconcile with him as he wished, she could not count on his recommendation.
Speed has been an advocate for women in academia in recent years. However no amount of advocacy on behalf of women can cancel out the physical and mental harm caused by prolonged sexual harassment. Speed’s self-proclamation that he is a “male feminist” rings hollow.
Update on June 6, 2018: Terry Speed is no longer listed as Professor Emeritus at UC Berkeley.
Update on June 22, 2018: This is the “notice of outcome” I received from UC Berkeley regarding the case:

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-03-23/terry-speed-ally-of-women-in-science-accused-of-harassment/9546170,"Australian Professor Terry Speed has long been a champion for women in science, so it has shaken the field to the core to find out that he has been accused of harassing a junior colleague 16 years ago, when he was her mentor.A Background Briefing investigation has revealed details of the complaint made to the University of California, Berkeley.Professor Speed denied his conduct amounted to harassment but back in June 2017, a university-appointed investigator found Professor Speed had violated the institution's sexual harassment policy.No further action has so far been taken by the university.The 'champion'Professor Speed is one of Australia's most decorated scientists, and has been promoted by some science groups as a male champion of change.He has served as professor of statistics at the University of California, Berkeley for nearly 30 years, and he is also the head of a bioinformatics lab at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Australia's oldest medical research institute, in Melbourne.In 2013, Professor Speed was awarded the Prime Minister's science prize for his breakthroughs in statistics and bioinformatics.At the time, he told The World Today that he would use his $300,000 cash prize to promote women in science.""And it's not as though I have in my genes any intrinsic pro-women thing — it's more just that when you get used to women who are trying to overcome these barriers, you join the cause.""The complaintProfessor Speed is alleged to have harassed a postdoctoral candidate whom he mentored at the time, who for privacy reasons will be referred to as Barbara.In April 2016 Barbara lodged a complaint with the university as ""Complainant One"".Professor Lior Pachter was a co-complainant. California-based Professor Lior Pachter wrote on his blog about the investigation into Terry Speed's behaviour towards his colleague, Barbara.(Supplied)According to Professor Pachter, Barbara enquired about making a complaint at the time the alleged harassment occurred, but she felt the university complaints process might harm her career.The university launched a Title IX investigation, in accordance with requirements under US federal law to resolve complaints about sexual harassment.The 47-page report detailed what happened on campus at the time, and the findings were filed with the university's leadership for final determination.The investigationIn early 2000, Professor Pachter noticed that Professor Speed was spending a lot of time with Barbara. Later that year Professor Speed invited Barbara for a research trip to Melbourne.According to the investigation's report, it was here that the alleged sexual harassment ramped up.The investigator described in her findings how he walked Barbara home in the evenings and then wanted to hug, despite Barbara's objection to the hugging.The report described how the professor emailed Barbara first thing in the morning, and many times throughout the day.He was disappointed when she did not respond as frequently as he wanted.His emails to Barbara included references to her attractiveness and his interest in physical contact.""I try to ignore beautiful women … this explains [my delay] in my falling for you,"" one e-mail said.Other e-mails referred to a wish for her to ""sit on [his] knee all day"" and a suggestion that ""sweat[ing] a lot in close proximity"" would be good for him.""I do love you, you know,"" he wrote.Barbara needed help, and she confided in her colleague Professor Pachter. ""She would ask me for advice about what to tell him and how to manage her professional relationship with him in light of this attention that she didn't want,"" Professor Pachter said.""She began talking to me about the fact that Terry Speed was engaging inappropriately with her, asking her for things she didn't want to do and to have a kind of relationship she didn't want to have.""The Berkeley investigation cited emails from the time, where Professor Speed professed his love to Barbara.In them he wrote that he was jealous when she spent time with others, and that he wanted her attention and wished to keep her close to him.Throughout their emails and conversations — which were referenced in the report — he made it clear that he was not after sex.Professor Speed talked about his longing for a romantic and intimate relationship.Spiralling out of controlAccording to Professor Pachter, the situation deteriorated quickly.""She kept asking for help to make the situation go away,"" he said.Barbara explicitly told Professor Speed that she wanted him to stop, and in an email she wrote to him:""You must never forget that you are my adviser. Whatever feelings you might have, you should never act upon them. I got upset … because you are gradually becoming more suggestive again. It's great that you seem to feel better lately, but I'm getting sick, and I'm getting very scared. I'm seriously considering leaving Berkeley and science altogether. I used to love doing research, but these days, I can't seem to enjoy anything.""Professor Pachter was himself in a precarious position.Professor Speed had started sending him emails, telling him that he had a crush on Barbara and asking for advice about how he could get to her.Those emails were all submitted to the Berkeley investigators.Professor Pachter said reading them again, 16 years on, still made him feel ill.In early 2002 Barbara became depressed — she withdrew from campus life and lost all interest in studying.""I know that she was thinking about the situation every waking moment for a very long period of time, not just when the harassment happened but for a long period thereafter,"" Professor Pachter said.The career 'kiss of death'In her official findings, the university investigator wrote that Professor Speed seemed oblivious of his ability to profoundly affect Barbara, and that he did not seem to understand the power imbalance in the relationship.In 2002, when Barbara's postdoc placement had come to an end and she was applying for jobs, Professor Speed was asked to provide a professional opinion of Barbara. The Berkeley investigator uncovered an email with Professor Speed's response to the request, in which he wrote that his opinion of Barbara was ""high indeed"", but he would not be providing a professional opinion.""I think you will have to use your existing impressions or seek other assistance,"" Professor Speed wrote.""I am very sorry to have to write in this way, but things between Barbara and me are not good, and it saddens me greatly.""Professor Speed then forwarded this response to Barbara and asked her to meet with him.In her mind, she told the investigator, this confirmed his behaviour was jeopardising her career and it could all be fixed if she just reconciled with him on his terms.Professor Pachter agreed and told the investigator that the professor's refusal was a terrible blow.""I think that is the kiss of death in academia, when the mentor you came to do a postdoc with and that you worked with for a number of years is literally not willing to say anything about you.""I think it's even really more horrible that he then forwarded this correspondence to her — why would you do that other than to really show her, look, you see, you're not going to get my help?""When the investigator interviewed Professor Speed, he denied that his intention had been to harm Barbara's career.He said his refusal to send a professional recommendation was for technical reasons only.There has been no evidence to suggest that Professor Speed has been involved in any inappropriate behaviour other than the incident involving Barbara 16 years ago.The essential facts of the case are not in dispute, but Professor Speed's interpretation of events is different to those of Barbara and Professor Pachter.Professor Speed told the investigator in an interview that he believed his behaviour was not sexual in nature and did not amount to harassment.The science community respondsIn a statement, UC Berkeley refused to confirm or deny the existence of the investigation.Tired of waiting for UC Berkeley to determine an outcome following the investigation's findings, in January 2018 Professor Pachter penned a blog post about how Professor Speed had been investigated over allegations of sexual harassment.His post rocked Australia's science community.Professor Speed was approached by Background Briefing about the investigation and its findings, but he declined to comment.However he did write on his Berkeley webpage that Professor Pachter's public representation of him was inaccurate and ""not a reflection of me as a person"".In the weeks after the case was revealed, a number of elite science institutions in Australia have flagged changes to their internal sexual harassment policies. Michelle Gallaher says the 'leaky pipeline' of women leaving STEMM is 'more like a sieve'.(Supplied)Michelle Gallaher, the co-founder of Women in STEMM Australia, said she was surprised to learn about the sexual harassment investigation against Professor Speed, particularly because of his reputation as a ""male champion of change"".""I think the incidence of sexual harassment is far, far higher than we ever imagined it would be,"" Ms Gallagher said.There are a number of initiatives by science bodies in Australia designed to stop the ""leaky pipeline"" — a term that describes how the number of women in science drop off as they climb the scientific ranks.Ms Gallaher said some women leave STEMM (science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine) careers because of their experience with sexual harassment.""The leaky pipeline is a very big problem — it's more like a sieve actually and it's very emotive that we lose so much talent,"" she said.Ms Gallaher said she wanted to see consequences following the investigation that found Professor Speed in breach of UC Berkeley's sexual harassment policies.She said it was important for her organisation to speak out about this incident, in support of sexual harassment victims in general and in support of the female complainant in Professor Speed's case.""I want the young woman involved to know that we stand with her, and understand exactly what she's saying,"" she said."
https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/03/26/uc-settles-sexual-harassment-case-involving-student-school-therapist/,"The University of California has reached a settlement in a sexual harassment case involving a student and a former campus therapist.
The student, then a freshman going by the alias Justina Roe, alleged in a lawsuit filed in September that then-post-doctoral fellow Eric Samuels sexually harassed her last school year, asking about her sex life during therapy sessions at Cal’s Tang Center intended to help her overcome the stress of being away from home and exams.
Samuels, who denied the suit’s claims and maintains a private therapy practice in Oakland and San Francisco, was dismissed from the case and is not part of the settlement.
“These allegations were outlandish and he has been exonerated through this settlement,” said Jamie L. Dupree, a lawyer for Samuels.
Dupree said the settlement, reached earlier this month, is for $250,000. UC declined to confirm the settlement amount, but acknowledged it had reached an agreement.
“The plaintiff dismissed all the sexual harassment related claims (including dismissing Eric Samuels), leaving only the professional negligence claim, which was then resolved as part of the settlement,” said UC Berkeley spokeswoman Janet Gilmore. “Though we are pleased that the matter has been resolved, we are saddened when any student feels that the campus failed them in some way.  We are committed to creating and maintaining a campus environment where everyone feels safe and respected.”				
Lawyers for Roe did not immediately return a request for comment.
“I am relieved that I am able to put this behind me,” Samuels said in a statement.				
UC Berkeley has dealt with a number of sexual harassment cases in recent years, including one involving former law school dean Sujit Choudhry. Choudhry admitted to inappropriately touching his former assistant but was permitted to remain a tenured member of the faculty.
Following a spate of high-profile cases, UC has updated its sexual harassment policies, requiring more training for faculty and students and forming a student advisory board.

http://dailybruin.com/2017/03/02/uc-irvine-dean-maintained-majority-of-salary-after-title-ix-violations/,"This post was updated March 2 at 6:30 p.m.
A University of California, Irvine, professor and former dean who sexually harassed employees continued earning more than $200,000 a year after Title IX investigations found him responsible in 2014.
Joseph Lewis, an arts professor and former dean of the Claire Trevor School of the Arts had 26 allegations of sexual harassment made against him, according to documents released by UC Irvine on Tuesday.
Lewis repeatedly made sexual comments to women and touched them inappropriately between 2013 and May 2014, three months before he resigned from his position as dean.
Lewis was found responsible for several of the allegations, but continued to make $205,000 as of 2015, just $33,000 less than his pay in 2014.
Between 2014 and 2015, Lewis took a paid sabbatical before returning as a professor, according to his career history page.
Witnesses said they saw or personally experienced Lewis looking women up and down, bullying people, making sexual innuendos, making sexual comments about donors or using vulgar language that is demeaning to women. He denied many of the allegations against him.
One witness said that during an event, Lewis grabbed a female student by the arm and “pulled (her) to him in an embrace.” The witness said the student looked uncomfortable, and Lewis let her go after a few moments.
A complainant also said Lewis rubbed the satin cover of a book “in a circular motion with his fingers,” and said “I need to rub it, get it nice and (wet),” and then rubbed his fingertips together.
Lewis denied he made these comments and gestures.
On another occasion, a complainant said Lewis showed her an allergy test, which included photos of his naked back and buttocks on a doctor’s table.
Lewis denied showing pictures of his naked back and buttocks, but said he did show the the complainant a picture of his allergy test.
Lewis also drew his initials on a woman’s back with his finger, according to the report. When she asked what he was doing, Lewis said, “Branding you.”
In a letter dated Oct. 2, 2014, UCI Associate Chancellor Michael Arias said it was mutually decided Lewis would no longer serve as dean for the school of the arts.
UC Irvine spokesperson Tom Vasich said he cannot comment further about Lewis’ case because the information is confidential. He added UC Irvine takes all reports on sexual misconduct seriously, and has dedicated on-campus resources for investigating complaints.
“In each of the cases, we took steps to stop what was going on,” Vasich said. “All violations were met with appropriate actions.”
Vasich also confirmed Lewis took a paid sabbatical between 2014 and 2015. He said the university pays for sabbaticals for professors to work on projects in their academic interests outside the university.
Vasich confirmed Lewis will continue teaching for UCI.

http://dailybruin.com/2017/02/28/professor-emeritus-found-to-have-violated-uc-sexual-misconduct-policy/,"Correction: The original version of this article incorrectly stated Eric Gans was prohibited from teaching or lecturing under the terms of the settlement. In fact, he was also prohibited from administering research projects funded by gifts or applying for future employment within the UC, among other restrictions.This post was updated Feb. 28 at 10 p.m.
A UCLA professor emeritus was one of at least 25 UCLA faculty, staff and contractors who violated sexual misconduct policy within the past three years, according to documents received by The Daily Californian.
Eric Gans, a French and Francophone studies distinguished professor emeritus, violated the UC Policy on Sexual Harassment and the Faculty Code of Conduct by seeking to establish an unwelcome romantic relationship with the student. At least 113 University of California faculty, staff and contractors violated sexual misconduct policy within the past three years.
The findings resulted from a Title IX investigation by Pamela Thomason, then-Title IX officer for UCLA, after the student filed a complaint.
The report also found Gans’ unwelcome sexual attention caused the graduate student to lose access to educational opportunities because the student felt she was unable to replace Gans with someone with similar expertise.
Gans sent a letter to the student one week before he would evaluate her review exam in which he professed his love for her.
“There is no doubt an asymmetry in our affection,” Gans said in the letter. “The only girl in all my years I cannot think of without tears.”
The investigation repeatedly mentioned how Gans made the graduate student feel anxious and distressed with his poems, letters and emails.
According to the investigation, Gans contended his advances were welcome, but Thomason said the evidence shows the graduate student repeatedly tried to get Gans to cease unwelcome attention.
“The evidence reflects that Gans exerted psychological pressure on (the student) to submit, including references to his own mortality and to how she changed his life,” Thomason said in the report.
After the investigation, Gans settled a lawsuit with UCLA in November 2014 and agreed to resign from his position as professor. He assumed professor emeritus status, except he was prohibited from teaching or lecturing students, administering research projects funded by gifts or applying for future employment within the UC, among other restrictions.
He assumed professor emeritus status and assumed all privileges, except he was prohibited from teaching or lecturing under the terms of the settlement.
The Daily Californian and other media outlets received UC Title IX investigation reports Tuesday after filing a California Public Records Act request. According to the documents, about a third of the 113 UC employees who violated UC sexual misconduct and harassment policy retained their jobs within the university system.
The Daily Bruin will release details about the other 24 cases after reviewing the documents.

https://highlandernews.org/32613/sexual-harassment-allegations-surround-sudden-retirement-vcsa-sandoval/,"
Archive/HIGHLANDER
In the last week, multiple sources have told The Highlander that the sudden retirement of former UC Riverside Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs James Sandoval in January stemmed from an extensive Title IX investigation into sexual harassment allegations made against Sandoval in the early summer of 2017.
The sources’ claims come in the wake of a Detroit News report that UCR Chancellor Kim Wilcox may have ignored claims of sexual harassment and abuse against the former College of Osteopathic Medicine Dean William Strampel at Michigan State University (MSU), where Wilcox served as provost from August 2005 to July 2013.
That report suggests that Wilcox was made aware of Strampel’s behavior as early as 2010, when a dean performance review included complaints that Strampel openly commented about women’s bodies and boasted about his sex life. Despite these complaints, Wilcox nonetheless endorsed Strampel, writing, “Our several discussions over the past several months have reinforced my commitment and that of Dean Strampel to advancing the goals of the College within the broad mission of Michigan State University.”
When asked about the report, Wilcox wrote in a statement emailed to The Highlander last Wednesday, “I will not comment on any ongoing investigations or legal proceedings involving Michigan State University at this time. I join MSU in supporting efforts to provide the public and authorities with all documents and records necessary for a full and transparent investigation, including any records that involve my participation.”
But revelations of Wilcox’s alleged misfeasance at MSU have led some sources at UCR to see a pattern in what they claim is a failure to act promptly on complaints made against Sandoval.
According to a source who requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation, an internal investigation into Sandoval’s behavior was conducted by UCR Human Resources beginning in the summer of 2017. Sandoval continued to work at the university while this investigation was ongoing, sources say. This probe eventually absolved Sandoval of wrongdoing which, according to one source, led to complaints from frustrated staff and faculty who believed he was personal friends with the person leading the investigation.
Following these complaints, sources say, the university enlisted UC’s Title IX office to conduct another investigation into Sandoval’s behavior. A source claims that this outside investigation found even more instances of wrongdoing, leading officials to encourage Sandoval to take leave from the university in November.
Emails sent by The Highlander to Wilcox’s office requesting comment on these claims were not directly answered. Instead, campus spokesperson John Warren wrote in an email that he was unable to confirm whether there is an investigation at all: “University personnel matters are confidential under §6254 of the California Government Code. Disclosing any information constitutes an ‘unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.’ Even commenting on whether there is an investigation can be interpreted as a violation of the code.”
AN OLD BOYS’ CLUB?
For some staff and faculty with knowledge of the matter, allowing Sandoval to remain on payroll while an investigation into his alleged harassment was ongoing is very similar to what former UCR Chief Campus Counsel Michele Coyle described as “an old boys’ club mentality” in her 2013 lawsuit against former Executive Vice Chancellor (EVC) and Provost Dallas M. Rabenstein as well as the UC Regents.
In fall of 2012, Coyle made multiple demands that the UCR administration and UC Regents “make efforts to remedy the hostile work environment and discriminatory culture on UCR’s campus,” per the case pleading. However, she was repeatedly stonewalled by campus administrators, and eventually fired by then-Chancellor Timothy White after requesting funds for data showing UCR’s compliance with affirmative action.
The jury found that the Regents retaliated against Coyle in violation of the California Fair Employment and Housing Act and in violation of Labor Code section 1102.5. She was awarded $2.5 million in damages.
Since the publication of the Detroit News report, some staff and faculty have openly speculated how long Wilcox, 63, will remain in his post. The chancellor is due for his five-year review — a performance evaluation of senior campus administrators that is conducted by a confidential review committee every five years of an administrator’s tenure — by the end of this academic year, and sources believe those conducting the review in the UCR Academic Senate are taking the allegations very seriously. However, no representatives for the senate were available to comment by time of print.
Chancellor Wilcox does still have support from UC officials. In a statement released on Wednesday, UC President Napolitano said that Wilcox had proactively spoken to her about Strampel and “described the situation as best he could recall” before the publication of the Detroit News report. Napolitano also called for a “full and fair evaluation of all the facts as they pertain to Chancellor Wilcox.”
The Title IX investigation into Sandoval’s alleged misconduct is still ongoing, sources say.

http://www.dailycal.org/2017/02/28/its-rampant-documents-reveal-113-uc-employees-violated-sex-misconduct-policy-in-past-3-years/,"At least 124 cases involving University of California faculty, staff and contractors show the employees were found to have violated UC sexual violence and harassment policy over the past three years at all UC campuses. Among them are award-winning scholars, lauded department chairs and highly paid NCAA coaches.
The Daily Californian obtained hundreds of pages of UC documents Tuesday through a California Public Records Act request. They detail years of unwanted sexual advances, inappropriate comments and physical assaults, spanning from Jan. 1, 2013, to April 6, 2016.
About one-third of those who violated policy are still employed by the UC system.
“It’s important to note that these cases run from January 2013 to April 2016, so most, if not all, of these cases were investigated and adjudicated under policies and procedures that are no longer in effect,” said UC spokesperson Claire Doan. “We’ve made so many drastic and significant improvements over the past two and a half years … that we are able to provide more clarity (and) more fairness … when it comes to these investigations.”
Among the respondents included in the documents, Title IX investigations found:

Rudy Thomas, the former director of strength and conditioning in athletics at UC San Diego, was training a female client when he inappropriately touched her breast and genital area. When she said she was uncomfortable and attempted to leave, he hugged and tried to kiss her on the mouth.


Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor of Sikh studies at UC Santa Barbara, invited a student up to his bedroom during a meeting for a research project and asked her to lie down on his bed, putting his hand under her shirt.


Eric Gans, a professor of French and Francophone studies at UCLA, sent an email to a graduate student that said, “There is no doubt an asymmetry in our affection. … The only girl in all my years I cannot think of without tears.”

All three violated UC sexual misconduct policy, the investigations found.
“It’s rampant,” said Kristen Glasgow, a UCLA graduate student who filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against the university alleging that history professor Gabriel Piterberg had harassed her, in a November interview with the Daily Cal. “I know more women who have gone through it than who haven’t.”
Seven percent of all cases released Tuesday involved sexual assault. Twenty-five percent of those who violated policy were faculty. Thirty-five percent of the complaints were made by students.
Most of the documents have never been publicly released. The documents shed light on the full scale of sexual misconduct across the UC system — a crisis that has led administrators to resign, students to protest and the UC president to rethink the way the university handles complaints.
Many of the documents were heavily redacted. Information was redacted to reflect “competing public interests,” according to the UC Office of General Counsel. The university did not disclose any reports from ongoing investigations, or from investigations prior to Jan. 1, 2013, stating that such reports would not shed “significant additional light” on the university’s current practices.
“The University recognizes that there is a significant public interest in records that reflect the adequacy of the University’s investigation of and response to complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence,” the UC Office of General Counsel said in a statement announcing the release of the documents. “However, there are several competing public interests that must also be balanced under the Public Records Act or other relevant statutes.”
The university also highlighted recent reforms to the way it handles complaints, including a 2016 update to the UC sexual misconduct policy and a systemwide peer-review committee to approve any sanctions that involve a “senior university leader.”

Doan added that the university is “committed to and continuously working towards maintaining an environment in which all members of the community are free from harassment and discrimination.”
The Tuesday release comes after reports were disclosed to the Daily Cal in April 2016 that revealed 19 UC Berkeley employees were found to have violated UC sexual misconduct policy since 2011. Those in violation included former UC Berkeley School of Law dean Sujit Choudhry and former vice chancellor for research Graham Fleming.
The university has faced criticism in recent years for punishments perceived as too light and for a process seen as cumbersome for victims. The case of Tyann Sorrell, Choudhry’s executive assistant, rocked the Berkeley campus in 2016 after news broke that Choudhry had violated UC sexual misconduct policy after repeatedly kissing and hugging Sorrell.
As punishment, then-executive vice chancellor and provost Claude Steele docked Choudhry’s pay by 10 percent for one year and required him to attend counseling and write an apology letter to Sorrell.
The Daily Cal’s most recent PRA request also revealed a case involving Juan Ramos, a former UC Berkeley facilities management employee, that was not disclosed in April 2016. A Title IX investigation found that Ramos had committed a sexual battery on the complainant, whose name was redacted.
The complainant, unaffiliated with the university, alleged that on April 10, 2014, Ramos approached her from behind and asked her for “dollars” while in the Campus Shared Services building. Ramos began to do a “strip tease dance” for her and removed his shirt before grabbing her breasts from behind, the investigation found. The complainant both recorded a video and took a photograph of Ramos from her phone as evidence for the incident.
Ramos later admitted to investigators that he had consumed “marijuana chocolate” before the incident and had been sleeping in the CSS building.
The complainant also alleged that Ramos made various inappropriate remarks to her, starting roughly in January 2014.
Ramos’ employment was terminated, effective Aug. 5, 2014, on the grounds that he had violated UC sexual harassment policy, according to documents.
This is a developing story, and The Daily Californian will provide additional information as it parses through the 124 newly disclosed cases it received Tuesday. Please check back for updates.

https://www.statnews.com/2018/10/16/stanton-glantz-ucsf-sexual-harrassment/,"
	The University of California, San Francisco, has agreed to pay a former postdoc $150,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit involving a prominent tobacco researcher on its faculty.
In the settlement, dated last month, Stanton Glantz, director of the UCSF Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, and UCSF “deny and dispute” the allegations by the former postdoc, Dr. Eunice Neeley, who now is a resident in family medicine at Emory University in Atlanta.
In a lawsuit filed last December, Neeley claimed that Glantz, who was her supervisor, sexually harassed her — making lurid remarks, ogling her breasts repeatedly, and forcing her to hug him on several occasions — beginning during her interview for a job in 2015. She also claimed that he refused to include her name on a research paper.
Glantz agreed in the settlement to transfer ownership over the paper, and control over where it is published, to Neeley. And the university agreed to hold a two-hour training on sexual harassment and sensitivity for all employees and managers of Glantz’s tobacco research center.
Glantz continues to deny the allegations, and places the blame for the dispute over the paper on the fact that Neeley submitted it twice without his approval, while listing him as an author. He indicated in a statement posted on his website that he was willing to keep fighting the case with Neeley — but that the financial toll was too great. “The decision to settle this case was made by the [University of California] Regents, with my concurrence, that settling the case was preferable to the continuing costs of years of litigation.”
		
		
Within days of the settlement, the university notified Neeley that it was considering taking action of its own. An internal UCSF investigation had concluded in December that Glantz’s conduct “comprised hostile work environment sexual harassment,” though it did not find evidence to support a number of Neeley’s allegations, according to a report obtained by STAT and Retraction Watch. A second complainant’s name was redacted from the report, which recommended that the university “take remedial action.”
UCSF Chancellor Sam Hawgood subsequently accepted the conclusions of a faculty committee “that there is probable cause that Dr. Glantz’ conduct violated the Faculty Code of Conduct,” according to a Sept. 14 letter, also provided to STAT and Retraction Watch. That letter, signed by Brian K. Alldredge, UCSF’s vice provost for academic affairs, and sent to Neeley, says that UCSF had notified Glantz that, as discipline, it proposed he undergo training on sexual harassment and proper workplace conduct. In addition, the school proposed that it put a letter of censure in Glantz’s personnel file that would remain for five years.
Glantz, Alldredge wrote, could have the letter of censure removed more quickly if, at his own expense, he completes at least six sessions of anti-harassment training provided by an outside vendor and “there are no further reports of inappropriate behavior in violation of University policies” during a one-year period.
		
		
Glantz was given 15 business days to accept or decline the chancellor’s proposed discipline; if he declined, the matter would be referred to the school’s Academic Senate, or he could attempt to negotiate a resolution with the university.
Asked whether he had agreed to the chancellor’s terms, Glantz said university policy prevented him from commenting further. UCSF said it could not comment because “the disciplinary process is not yet complete.”
Last December, a day after BuzzFeed News reported on Neeley’s suit, Glantz posted a response in which he denied “every claim reported to be included in this lawsuit.” As for the authorship dispute, he cited a June 21, 2017, letter to the journal in which UCSF officials stated that “the reason that Dr. Glantz did not include Dr. Neeley as an author when he initially submitted the manuscript on May 26, 2017 was that, despite repeated requests, Dr. Neeley had refused to grant Dr. Glantz permission to include her as an author on the paper.”
		
		
The June 21 letter came a week after two UCSF officials sent Neeley an email demanding that she “cease submitting this manuscript to any journal or any other venue for publication” because she had twice submitted it without Glantz’s approval.
According to Glantz, he and Neeley each submitted their own versions of the paper — on a project called the total exposure study, or TES — to the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention. Glantz’s version did not include Neeley, while hers omitted a postdoc who had worked on the project.
Glantz wrote that the journal rejected both articles because of the authorship issues. Glantz then tried again to get their work published, this time in the journal Tobacco Control. The journal rejected the manuscript.
On Nov. 9, 2017, Neeley’s attorneys wrote a letter to the American Association for Cancer Research, which publishes Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, saying that they were planning to sue Glantz and UCSF, and asking that the journal “confirm you will not publish Dr. Neeley’s paper without her being named as the primary author or we will proceed accordingly.” Attorneys for the AACR responded four days later to say that the paper was not being published in any of the association’s journals.
		
		
In a statement posted on his UCSF website last month, Glantz said he decided to cede the ground to Neeley as part of the settlement. “My reason for doing so is that … I had already decided to abandon efforts to publish the TES manuscript due to the issues raised by Tobacco Control’s peer reviewers,” he wrote.
Neither Neeley nor her attorney, Kelly Armstrong, responded to requests for comment.
Born in 1946, Glantz has been dubbed the “Ralph Nader of the anti-tobacco movement.” A major figure in the field for decades, he has conducted research on the adverse health effects of smoking as well as public policy surrounding tobacco. In 1994, Glantz gave UCSF, which he joined in 1975, his collection of tobacco-related papers — including more than 4,000 pages of internal documents from the Brown  Williamson tobacco company — helping build the institution’s Tobacco Control Archives.
His work helped lay the foundation for the 1998 “master settlement agreement” between 46 U.S. attorneys general, five other jurisdictions, and the country’s largest tobacco companies — a deal worth nearly $250 billion over 25 years — but Glantz opposed the pact on the ground that it allowed the firms to stay in business and sell their products in the developing world.
Glantz, who has been awarded tens of millions of dollars in grants for his work — including most recently a five-year, $20 million award from the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration — still faces a sexual harassment suit filed by research associate Juliette Jackson. Jackson alleges that Glantz leered at her breasts, and that she was “treated differently than other employees because of her race,” the San Francisco Examiner reported. Glantz denies those claims.

https://www.insidehighered.com/quicktakes/2018/10/24/uc-san-francisco-settles-former-postdoc,"The University of California, San Francisco, settled with a former postdoctoral researcher for $150,000 after she sued it, saying a high-profile tobacco researcher harassed her. The former postdoc, Eunice Neeley, alleged in a December lawsuit that Stanton Glantz, Truth Initiative Distinguished Professor of Tobacco Control, ogled her body, forced her to hug him and made inappropriate sexual comments during conversations. Neeley said Glantz also retaliated against her by removing her name from a paper after she filed an internal complaint against him.
The San Francisco Chronicle reported that the settlement also stipulates that Glantz will relinquish his rights to the paper in question and transfer authorship to Neeley. Glantz denies all of Neeley's allegations. Both Glantz and the university reportedly declined comment. Glantz has previously denied the allegations in more detail, including by saying that Neeley did not want her name on the disputed paper. The Chronicle reported that an internal university investigation found Glantz violated the Faculty Code of Conduct with Neeley, and that he now has the option to appeal the findings before a faculty committee.
The university has been paying Glantz’s legal bills, including to fight a second harassment suit filed by a former employee, a paralegal named Juliette Jackson. Jackson alleges that she reported Glantz to campus officials in early 2017 and that they mishandled her case, including through undue delays. Glantz has reportedly denied leering at Jackson, who is Native American, but admitted to calling Native Americans “Indians.”

In 13 cases, the records don’t say what discipline, if any, was imposed, while 19 employees in this category received a less severe form of punishment.Article continues below this Among them were two UCSF doctors and a manager.In 2014, UCSF placed a letter of rebuke temporarily in the file of an obstetrics doctor for “inappropriate touching of employees,” including shoulder rubbing and massages, having an overtly sexual relationship with a nurse that included stroking her body in public, and referring to women as “bitches.” UCSF officials had reprimanded the doctor for similar behavior two years earlier. Rather than fire the doctor for continuing to violate the university’s sexual harassment policy, UCSF spent $10,000 on a behavior coach for him.In 2013, an orthopedics professor also received a temporary letter of rebuke and was demoted to associate professor for using his position to manipulate one of his doctoral students into a sexual relationship. And in 2015, a male manager was moved to another building after groping the buttocks and waist of two female employees.UCSF spokeswoman Laura Kurtzman said those three employees have been the subject of no new complaints. She said the doctor was not fired because the complaints came from colleagues, not patients.Article continues below this Yet if the violations had happened today, rather than a few years ago, the outcome might have been different.“Most of the cases included in this records release were investigated and adjudicated under policies and processes that are no longer in effect,” said Claire Doan, a spokeswoman for the university system.UC and state law define sexual harassment as unwelcome conduct ranging from sexual comments to sexual assault.Since 2014, UC has “taken steps to significantly change and improve the way such cases are handled,” Doan said.Many of those steps — including new policies, more campus resources to address sexual harassment complaints, and better oversight of disciplining executives who harass — occurred after news stories and a lawsuit in 2015 and 2016 revealed that UC Berkeley looked the other way when at least three high-profile employees sexually harassed students and colleagues. They were Geoffrey Marcy, a famous astronomer; Graham Fleming, a vice chancellor; and Sujit Choudhry, dean of the law school.Article continues below this Meanwhile, several news outlets, including KQED and UC Berkeley’s campus newspaper, the Daily Californian, requested public records on sexual harassment cases at all 10 campuses. This week, the university made those records public.In all, UC said it had 113 sexual harassment cases in three years across its 10 campuses. The Chronicle, however, counted 116 cases among the released documents. Even so, the cases represented a small fraction of all 250,000 UC employees.Luz Portillo works on her computer in her office at Kristensen Weisberg Law Firm at 4pm in Los Angeles, CA.Jessica Pons/Special to ChronicleAs part of the university’s upgraded rules, every employee, from food-service workers to executives, is required to take sexual harassment prevention training, said Doan.But Wendy Patrick, a trial attorney in San Diego specializing in sexual harassment cases, is skeptical about the benefits of such training.Article continues below this “Many sexual harassers are motivated by power, which they attain through intimidating and humiliating others,” Patrick said. “One thing harassers have in common is a lack of respect for rules and regulations — which explains why sexual harassment training does not improve their behavior. They know the rules; they don´t care.”In analyzing the documents, The Chronicle looked at how UC campuses disciplined employees who inappropriately touched or assaulted others.“The more serious the offense, the more serious the response should be,” said Dan Eaton, an attorney who advises employers on sexual-harassment prevention and teaches business ethics at San Diego State University. “The general rule in sexual harassment is that the response should be the one that will effectively deter and punish the particular behavior at issue.”San Francisco Chronicle LogoIt’s not clear from the documents whether that is always the approach taken by UC campuses. Among those cases:Article continues below this • UC Davis decided against disciplining a professor with a reputation for inappropriate behavior who in 2014 repeatedly leaned against and touched a female colleague, including while they worked with a patient. Davis officials said the work space was small and the professor “may not be cognizant of what he is doing.”Davis officials also gave a warning letter to an employee for touching a colleague’s buttocks and crotch in 2013. And they suspended a nurse for three days without pay that year for his second sexual harassment violation: slapping a colleague’s buttocks and upper thigh and, in view of patients, holding hand sanitizer at his groin while stroking and squirting it to simulate masturbation.• UC Riverside suspended a male employee for five days without pay in 2013 for tickling, nudging and poking numerous people he supervised. The man also asked subordinates about their sex lives and whispered “I love you. Do you love me?” into a subordinate’s ear. Officials also suspended a male employee for two days without pay for touching a colleague’s breast.• UC Santa Barbara sent an employee to counseling and harassment prevention training after he grabbed and squeezed a colleague’s breast, tried to put his tongue in her mouth, and bit her neck hard enough to leave a mark.• UC Irvine demoted a dean who hugged and caressed another employee — including touching her neck and bra strap and commenting on her appearance.In January, UC was ordered to pay a record $1.15 million settlement to a former UC Santa Cruz student over her claim that a professor raped her when she was his student in June 2015, and that campus officials knew the man had a history of preying on students but did nothing to stop him.The Chronicle isn’t naming the professor because he hasn’t been charged with a crime. UC Santa Cruz officials have said they placed him on leave in August 2015 and that he resigned in June 2016 as disciplinary proceedings began.Luz Portillo poses for a portrait in front of her work at Kristensen Weisberg Law Firm at 4pm in Los Angeles, CA.Jessica Pons/Special to ChronicleAlthough The Chronicle doesn’t usually name victims of sexual assault, the former student, Luz Portillo, 24, has spoken out publicly about her case — specifically that it took the campus far too long to address the matter, a persistent complaint among assault and harassment victims, despite UC’s reforms.On Thursday, Portillo expressed outrage at the extent of the problems detailed in the UC documents.“It’s atrocious,” she said from Los Angeles, where she lives now. UC is “very inconsistent” in its treatment of accusers and the accused.

http://www.mercurynews.com/2017/02/28/university-of-california-details-emerging-on-100-sexual-harassment-cases-systemwide-new-documents-show/,"A correction to an earlier version of this article has been appended to the end of the article.
The University of California disciplined more than 100 employees for sexual misconduct, about a quarter of them faculty members, at campuses across the state in the nearly three years before a scandal blew up at UC Berkeley, according to documents released Tuesday after a public records request from this news organization.
The records covered a period from January 2013 to April 2016, and were requested after a series of sexual harassment cases surfaced at Berkeley that brought down prominent researchers, deans and coaches. In all, campuses across the state released details Tuesday on more than 110 cases.
The documents show for the first time how widespread sexual harassment was across the 10-campus UC system beyond Berkeley and which schools had the biggest problems:
UC San Francisco had 26 cases, the most of any UC campus, ranging from a cook offering a co-worker money for sex to a top fertility doctor inappropriately touching nurses and calling them “bitches.”
UCLA had 25 cases, including a French professor who wrote over 300 poems professing his love to his graduate assistant, and a cancer researcher who sent sexually explicit jokes to colleagues and had been accused of sexual harassment twice before.				
UC Davis had 13 cases and UC Irvine had 11 and UC San Diego had 9. UC Berkeley had released records of 19 cases last year.
The allegations ranged from inappropriate comments to sexual assault, according to a summary from UC President Janet Napolitano’s office.				
About 58 percent of the cases were generated by complaints from staff members, 35 percent were from student complaints, and the rest are unknown or anonymous.
Seven percent of the cases involved sexual assault, including inappropriate touching and nonconsensual sex. About two-thirds of the people accused of misconduct no longer work for the university, Napolitano’s office said, but it isn’t clear how many were fired.
The sexual misconduct at UC San Francisco included doctors and professors, including Dr. Mitchell Rosen, the director of UCSF’s fertility preservation center. He was censured in 2015 after an anonymous call to the school’s whistleblower hotline accused the doctor of having a relationship with one of the nurses and creating a hostile work environment, including piggyback rides in the office and the use of inappropriate language. Rosen and the nurse denied the affair, but investigators determined it happened. Rosen told investigators he was surprised about the complaints, saying they were “making mountains out of mole hills.”
UCSF found that Dr. Richard Schneider sexually harassed one of his students over a two-year period, involving a sexual relationship that included trips to a strip club, attempted sex in his office and at a conference. “She felt she had no choice but to acquiesce since Schneider had significant power and control over her future career,” investigators found.
Schneider said the woman initiated the relationship, it was consensual and it did not impact her treatment in his lab, according to the report. In February 2015, Schneider was demoted from professor to associate professor and censured.
Efforts to reach the doctors Tuesday night were unsuccessful.
In a statement Tuesday, Barbara French, UCSF’s vice chancellor for university relations, said in all of the cases the university “took steps to stop the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and remedy its effects. Where violations occurred, they were addressed by appropriate actions, training, counseling and/or demonstrated improvement on the part of the respondent, or training for the department.”
UC Santa Cruz professor Hector Perla — one of four employees disciplined for sexual misconduct at the campus — resigned last year after a student accused him of raping her in June 2015 on the day before graduation. He claimed the sex was consensual, but late last month, the UC regents agreed to pay the former student $1.15 million after she accused UC Santa Cruz of failing to properly investigate her claims.
The UC campuses released the heavily redacted records Tuesday, 16 months after a public records request from the Bay Area News Group and other media organizations.
Victims advocates and student groups say UC Berkeley’s scandal exposed a double standard: University staffers were routinely fired or forced to resign, but tenured faculty members who committed similar transgressions usually received lighter sanctions and were allowed to keep their jobs.
The controversy led Napolitano to re-examine the rules governing how UC professors are disciplined for sexual misconduct. Many of Berkeley’s most elite members who violated the campus’s sexual misconduct policy were initially disciplined through secretive agreements with academic administrators rather than the formal faculty conduct process.
Since then, UC has overhauled its policies on sexual violence, from mandatory sexual assault training for students to improved investigation protocols, said Claire Doan, a spokeswoman for the Office of the President. One new policy makes sure that proposed sanctions for senior leaders found to have engaged in sexual misconduct — chancellors, vice-chancellors, coaches and deans — are reviewed by a committee on each campus to ensure a fair outcome.
“As soon as these cases came to light at Berkeley, the president said: ‘How are we going to tackle this? What are the problems? How are we going to make these changes to make the process more transparent and fair for everyone involved?’” Doan said.
Referring to the files released Tuesday, she said, “Most of these cases were adjudicated under old processes that are no longer in effect.”
In April 2016, Berkeley released records showing rampant sexual misconduct on campus since 2011. In all, 19 employees — including six professors — were disciplined, including world-renowned astronomy professor Geoff Marcy, the dean of the law school, the men’s diving coach and an assistant men’s basketball coach. Victims included seven students and 10 employees.
University officials say the scrutiny has led to positive reforms, but advocates for the victims of campus sexual misconduct are still concerned.
“Even with the new policies, faculty still have quite a few more protections than students and staff, so I wonder how much of a difference they really would add,” said Cory Hernandez, a third-year law student at UC Berkeley appointed last year to serve on a campus committee on sexual violence. “A lot of these committees aren’t getting to the root of the issue, which is there needs to be a culture change.”

          Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus
Six UC Santa Barbara faculty and staff members violated sexual violence and harassment policy between January 2013 and April 2016, according to documents obtained by the Nexus on Wednesday.
UCSB and nine other UC campuses first released Title IX documents on Tuesday in response to a California Public Records Act request made by the Daily Californian over a year ago.
The documents identify approximately 124 Title IX violations across the UC system between Jan. 1, 2013, and April 6, 2016. Four of six cases at UCSB were reported by students, and the remaining were reported by UC staff.
The only full-time professor named in UCSB documents was Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor of global studies.
The Title IX office received a complaint in May 2013 from a female student alleging that Mann acted inappropriately with sexual conduct, both verbal and physical, during a research discussion meeting at Mann’s home.
Mann retired in 2015 but was a professor at the time of the investigation, which began in May 2013.
According to the documents, the female complainant said Mann asked her to sit on his bed with him and proceeded to lay beside her. While sitting on the bed, Mann allegedly touched her neck and chest around the area of her collarbone.
She said he inserted his hand inside her shirt, touched her stomach and put his face near to hers. When she confronted him, he responded that “he’s not a dirty old man, that, for him, what he had done was just like petting his cat.”
The student later wrote an email to Mann saying, “this really was extremely uncomfortable for me, I still have nightmares about it.” She also alleged that Mann, on several occasions, would rub her arm, shoulder and thigh.
In the Title IX report, Mann denied all allegations of harassment and said his primary aim was establishing a Santa Barbara school of Sikh studies, not “playing with young people in any way.”
Following an investigation, the Title IX office concluded in August 2013 that all such claims “more likely than not did occur” and that Mann had violated the UC’s sexual harassment policy.
The documents do not indicate actions taken by the university, and Mann has since been a guest lecturer at UCSB after his retirement.
The Title IX office received a report in May 2014 claiming that former music department lecturer Paul Sahuc allegedly sexually harassed a former music department graduate student.
The female subject claimed that Sahuc had said on multiple occasions, “Are you on your period?” during lessons. She also stated that he repeatedly walked into the women’s dressing room unannounced while people were changing.
According to the documents, several other witnesses offered information illustrating patterns of sexualized comments from Sahuc.
Following an investigation, the UCSB Title IX office concluded that the alleged conduct “more likely than not did occur,” and that both allegations violated sexual harassment policy.
Supriya Yelimeli / Daily Nexus
As a result, the music department declined to renew Sahuc’s employment contract, effectively terminating his university employment.
The Title IX office also received a report in April 2013 alleging that Facilities Management laborer Cresenciano Marin sexually harassed a senior custodian.
The female subject had previously complained to her supervisors about Marin’s conduct, but she received no resolution. A formal investigation began in April 2013.
As detailed in the documents, the complainant said while riding in an elevator together during their shift, Marin came up behind her as she bent down and put his hand on her back without her consent and made gestures “as to mock a sexual position.” After she told him he was being inappropriate, he responded that he would find her later and “violate/rape” her.
The complainant said Marin told her on several other occasions that she should “suck his dick,” asked her the color of her underwear and asked if the color of her pubic hair was the same color as the hair on her head.
The investigation also found that on an unknown date, coworkers found pornographic videos and newspaper clippings of the Nexus’ “Wednesday Hump” as well as “December 2006 Playboy Magazine Digital Edition” in his cleaning closet.
Marin denied all such claims, but the Title IX office substantiated all 11 sexual harassment claims against him. The university terminated his employment in July 2013 following the findings of the investigation.
The Title IX office received a report in April 2015 that a UCPD supervisor allegedly sexually harassed his female employee during an after-hours celebration at American Ale in downtown Santa Barbara.
According to the report, the male subject went to hug his employee and “grabbed her breast,” to which she “stood stupefied” and didn’t say anything. She went to push him away, but he “grabbed her face and stuck his tongue down her throat.” When she turned back around, he tried to hug her and “bit her neck, leaving a mark.”
The documents report that, when the female returned to the outdoor seating area, she informed the group that she was attacked. A witness reported to the Title IX office that the same male had “pinched his/her buttocks earlier that night.”
The male subject claimed he “blacked out” the night of the incident and could not respond to the allegations because he could not remember.
At the time of the allegation, he was working half-time in his department, and he became a full-time employee in July 2015.
As a result of the investigation, UCSB required the male subject to complete the university’s online sexual harassment prevention training and attend personal counseling.
The Title IX office received a report in November 2015 that a music department lecturer allegedly sexually harassed a former music department student.
The student claimed she was harassed through verbal conduct during piano lessons and that the male subject would comment on other women, saying “so-and-so’s boobs are hanging out,” “so-and-so’s ass cheeks are hanging out” and “women are provocative, and the things they wear seduce men, and it’s no wonder that all these women get raped.”
Another complainant said the music lecturer would tell her sexualized comments he made to other students like, “If this composer was here, he’d want to seduce you.”
The male subject denied the allegations against him, but the Title IX office concluded that the conduct “more likely than not did occur” and that the music lecturer had violated UC sexual harassment policy.
As a result of the investigation, the male subject received a 10 percent salary reduction and a written censure.
The Title IX office also received a report that a faculty member from the global studies department allegedly sexually harassed a fourth-year undergraduate student.
According to the female complainant, the male faculty member made jokes promoting rape culture that had no relevance to the class. The jokes were, “What was the wife’s favorite sex position? Facing Nordstrom’s.” and “Why were the sorority girls disappointed about being gang-raped? Because they had to write so many thank-you cards.”
The female complainant spoke out during lecture, saying that he was being inappropriate. The female subject dropped the global studies class that same day due to the “sexist classroom climate.”
She stated in her interview with the Title IX office that she could not concentrate for the remainder of the class because she was so upset by his comments. When asked what resolutions she sought through the process, she said that she did not believe the male subject should be teaching at the university.
According to the report, the male faculty member wrote through his attorney that he did not use the words “the wife,” “raped” or “sororities,” but admitted the jokes were made in poor taste.
Following an investigation, the Title IX office substantiated one of the three sexual harassment claims against the faculty member. The documents do not indicate whether the university took further disciplinary action.
According to UCSB Spokesperson Andrea Estrada, the university investigated and adjudicated all of the UCSB cases under policies and processes that have since been updated.
“Over the past two and a half years, UC has taken steps to significantly change — and improve — the ways such cases are handled,” she said in a statement.
The Nexus also obtained the Title IX documents of eight other campuses — UC Merced, UC Los Angeles, UC Davis, UC Santa Cruz, UC San Francisco, UC Riverside, UC Irvine and UC San Diego — and is currently sorting through them to determine further details.
Although UC Berkeley has not yet sent in its documents, the Daily Cal provided the number of sexual misconduct cases listed for its campus.

Six UC Santa Barbara faculty and staff members violated sexual violence and harassment policy between January 2013 and April 2016, according to documents obtained by the Nexus on Wednesday.
UCSB and nine other UC campuses first released Title IX documents on Tuesday in response to a California Public Records Act request made by the Daily Californian over a year ago.
The documents identify approximately 124 Title IX violations across the UC system between Jan. 1, 2013, and April 6, 2016. Four of six cases at UCSB were reported by students, and the remaining were reported by UC staff.
The only full-time professor named in UCSB documents was Gurinder Singh Mann, a professor of global studies.
The Title IX office received a complaint in May 2013 from a female student alleging that Mann acted inappropriately with sexual conduct, both verbal and physical, during a research discussion meeting at Mann’s home.
Mann retired in 2015 but was a professor at the time of the investigation, which began in May 2013.
According to the documents, the female complainant said Mann asked her to sit on his bed with him and proceeded to lay beside her. While sitting on the bed, Mann allegedly touched her neck and chest around the area of her collarbone.
She said he inserted his hand inside her shirt, touched her stomach and put his face near to hers. When she confronted him, he responded that “he’s not a dirty old man, that, for him, what he had done was just like petting his cat.”
The student later wrote an email to Mann saying, “this really was extremely uncomfortable for me, I still have nightmares about it.” She also alleged that Mann, on several occasions, would rub her arm, shoulder and thigh.
In the Title IX report, Mann denied all allegations of harassment and said his primary aim was establishing a Santa Barbara school of Sikh studies, not “playing with young people in any way.”
Following an investigation, the Title IX office concluded in August 2013 that all such claims “more likely than not did occur” and that Mann had violated the UC’s sexual harassment policy.
The documents do not indicate actions taken by the university, and Mann has since been a guest lecturer at UCSB after his retirement.
The Title IX office received a report in May 2014 claiming that former music department lecturer Paul Sahuc allegedly sexually harassed a former music department graduate student.
The female subject claimed that Sahuc had said on multiple occasions, “Are you on your period?” during lessons. She also stated that he repeatedly walked into the women’s dressing room unannounced while people were changing.
According to the documents, several other witnesses offered information illustrating patterns of sexualized comments from Sahuc.
Following an investigation, the UCSB Title IX office concluded that the alleged conduct “more likely than not did occur,” and that both allegations violated sexual harassment policy.

As a result, the music department declined to renew Sahuc’s employment contract, effectively terminating his university employment.

This inquiry follows a tumultuous year on campus that began when graffiti calling Balakrishnan a “sexual predator” appeared scrawled on bathroom mirrors. Flyers slipped under faculty doors, and signed “Undergraduate Students invested in the Humanities departments,” asked for a boycott of Balakrishnan and his work.In the face of these anonymous accusations, some faculty expressed their support of Balakrishnan in an email thread. It leaked, and provoked further outrage among current students and alumni.Nine people crafted an online letter demanding that Balakrishnan be barred from professional social events. That document, published in November 2017, weeks after the Harvey Weinstein allegations, included seven anonymous firsthand accounts of interactions with Balakrishnan that shocked the UC network and gathered over 160 signatures.Annaliese Harlander was among the hundreds of alumni who read this letter. As she told BuzzFeed News and school investigators, the anonymous stories motivated her to file a complaint about what happened to her.Harlander told the university that one night after graduation in 2013, Balakrishnan was attending a party at her friend’s house next door. Harlander said she drank a lot, and remembers the rest of the night in flashes. She told the Title IX investigator that Balakrishnan walked her home, that they kissed, and at some point, the two were both naked. She said that the professor performed oral sex on her and that he was trying to penetrate her, and remembers telling him to stop. She woke up the next day naked, disturbed, and reliving disturbing flashbacks to scenes of the night before.Two former students who were present at the party and heard the story from Harlander the next day, or in the weeks following, confirmed details of the account to the university, according to the investigator’s report obtained by BuzzFeed News. Harlander’s mother also confirmed to investigators that her daughter had mentioned such an event.In a statement to the Title IX investigator, Professor Balakrishnan said that he was present at the party on the evening in question, but that he did not have intercourse with Harlander. He also offered an alternate version of events: that Harlander had pulled him into her house as he was walking to his car, and took her top off — at which point he left.He also argued that university policies should not apply because the alleged incident took place off campus and because Harlander had graduated. The investigator disagreed, based on testimony from Harlander and three people who were at the party or spoke with her in the days after.“Respondent, with knowledge of Complainant’s extreme intoxication, took advantage of her [intoxication], went to her home and engaged in physical conduct of a sexual nature with Complainant. This sexual conduct included attempted penetration of his penis in Complainant’s vagina and performing oral sex on Complainant with Respondent’s genitalia situated in Complainant’s face,” investigator GayLynn Conant, a consultant hired by UC Santa Cruz to investigate Balakrishnan’s case, wrote in a Sept. 18 report to Interim Title IX Officer Cherie Scricca. Conant concluded that Balakrishnan’s conduct “falls squarely within the definition of prohibited conduct under the University of California Policy on Sexual Harassment Policy dated February 10, 2006.”Conant also investigated complaints filed by at least three other current or former students. In one case, alum Brian Glasscock told the investigator that Balakrishnan had provided him with cocaine and alcohol when Glasscock attended a party at Balakrishnan’s home in 2009. Glasscock, who was 18 at the time, said that Balakrishnan drove him home that night while drunk and high.The Title IX office referred Glasscock’s case to the office of UCSC’s Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp. She is currently reviewing this report, which includes interviews with nine people besides Glasscock and Balakrishnan, according to a letter the school sent to Glasscock and obtained by BuzzFeed News.In another complaint, alumnus Beth Peller alleged that when she was an undergraduate in 2014, Balakrishnan sat across from her at a university café, stared at her breasts, and asked her to go to a bar with him. Her complaint also claimed that in a separate incident, she had tried to prevent Balakrishnan from flirting with a drunk undergraduate at a bar, at which point Balakrishnan became verbally and physically aggressive.The Title IX office found that the “preponderance of evidence” suggested Balakrishnan was involved in at least some of the events described, but that his actions did not violate the university policy on sexual harassment and sexual violence at the time of the incidents. This case and another one, provided by student Amanda Reyes, a witness to Peller’s incident at the bar, were referred to Tromp to review for possible violations of other university policies, such as the Faculty Code of Conduct.Peller said she is frustrated by the emotional and administrative demands placed on her during the lengthy investigation process. For example, due to a dispute between Balakrishnan and her over where on her body a tattoo was located, she said she was asked to submit a photo of her upper body to investigators, which she found humiliating.

Harlander is seeking damages for pain and suffering, lost income and earning capacity, and medical and psychological care, as well as punitive damages.In January 2017, the University of California agreed to a landmark $1.15 million settlement with another student, who claimed that Hector Perla Jr., an assistant Latin American studies professor at UC Santa Cruz, had raped her a day before graduation. The university settled before a civil case or criminal charges were filed.Student protests about Balakrishnan have roiled campus since the spring of 2017, when graffiti calling him a “sexual predator” appeared on campus bathroom mirrors. Around the same time, faculty found flyers calling for a boycott of Balakrishnan and his work slipped under their office doors.A few months later, nine people published a letter online, writing that Balakrishnan had a “pattern of using his position of power as a professor and influential academic to intimidate, harass, and even assault young women and gender nonconforming people,” often in professional social settings.This letter was published weeks after the first allegations about Harvey Weinstein broke in the media and was shared widely among UC alumni, including Harlander. It described seven anonymous accounts of interactions with Balakrishnan.Harlander, who contacted the school with her account in 2018, told investigators and BuzzFeed News that she was moved to file her complaint with the university after reading those accounts.“If it wasn’t for the letter, we wouldn’t be where we are at today. I wouldn’t have spoken up,” she said.Alongside Harlander’s complaint, an investigator for the school also reviewed complaints by three other former or current students, including an alum who claimed that Balakrishnan had provided alcohol and cocaine at a party he attended in 2009. That complaint was referred to UC Santa Cruz Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor Marlene Tromp in September 2018.Citing privacy concerns, university spokesperson Marc DesJardins declined to say if the school was investigating any other Title IX complaints naming Balakrishnan.“Preventing sexual violence and sexual harassment is of utmost importance for UC Santa Cruz,” DesJardins said. “We are working diligently to create a campus that’s free from sexual misconduct.”

Gopal Balakrishnan, a tenured professor in the humanities division at UC Santa Cruz, has been fired after a months-long investigation into complaints of misconduct, the university confirmed to BuzzFeed News. The decision arrived after mounting pressure from students on campus.Last year, a UC Santa Cruz investigation found that Balakrishnan broke the school’s sexual harassment policy when he had oral sex with an undergraduate student without her consent when she was drunk, in 2013. The former student, Anneliese Harlander, filed a complaint with the school last spring, triggering a formal investigation into Balakrishnan’s conduct.At least three other complaints against Balakrishnan had also been filed with the university’s Title IX office, which handles issues of gender equity under a federal law meant to prevent sex discrimination.“The misconduct, confirmed through our investigation and adjudication process, harmed the complainants, and that trauma rippled through our campus and university system,” said UC Santa Cruz spokesperson Scott Hernandez-Jason, in an email to BuzzFeed News.""This is the only instance the Regents have dismissed a UCSC tenured faculty member in the last 20 years,"" said University of California Office of the President spokesperson Andrew Gordon, in an email to BuzzFeed News.Balakrishnan was a tenured Marxist historian at UC Santa Cruz. He had been on paid leave since fall 2017 and was suspended without pay on Aug. 15 this year, according to a letter sent by UC Santa Cruz Chancellor Cynthia Larive to Harlander, and confirmed by Hernandez-Jason.Balakrishnan’s case prompted growing campus demonstrations after it was made public in a BuzzFeed News report last year. Previously, rumors about his behavior toward students had sparked a Me Too–style campaign that split the campus community and led some to condemn the activism as “vigilante tactics.”The Regents of the University of California voted on Sept. 19 to dismiss Balakrishnan, agreeing with Larive’s recommendation as well as that of UC President Janet Napolitano, Larive wrote.“Respondent Balakrishnan’s behavior towards you was unwelcome, deeply harmed you, and interfered with your work prospects. The harm to you, alone, is sufficient to sustain the discipline against Respondent Balakrishnan,” Larive wrote in the letter, sent to Harlander on Monday. “Respondent Balakrishnan’s misconduct was not justified by the Ethical Principles found in the Faculty Code of Conduct and resulted in real damage to the University’s ability to carry out its mission and central functions.""“I’m grateful, though at the same time, there needs to be more that is done. Firing him is not enough of an action,” Harlander told BuzzFeed News. “I think that the university needs to ensure that their systems are drastically changed to ensure that this does not happen again, because Gopal Balakrishan is not the only one at that university or in the UC system that is a sexual predator. And there are many people who know that.”In past comments to journalists, Balakrishnan has denied wrongdoing. His lawyer Jamie Dupree previously told BuzzFeed News that the university “botched” its response to student activism involving her client. Balakrishnan and Dupree have not responded to a request for comment for this story.“It is rare for a university professor to be fired,” Kristina Larsen, an attorney who advised some of the complainants through the Title IX steps, told BuzzFeed News. “I’m not at all surprised that the university fired him but I can’t help think about how much damage had to be done to the individuals before it happened. This only happened because a group of coordinated activist students forced it to happen.”

http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1980/2/2/sexual-harassment-psan-jose-cal-two-eay/,"SAN JOSE, Cal--Two Eay Area professors, one at San Jose State University and the other at University of California at Berkeley, have been severely disciplined for allegedly sexually harassing women students.Philip Jacklin, associate professor of philosophy at San Jose State, was fired after a unanimous recommendation for dismissal by a faculty committee and by the university's president, Gail Fullerton.Five women students had accused Jacklin of persistently touching, embracing, kissing, fondling and propositioning them in incidents dating since the fall of 1977.At Berkeley, Elbaki Hermassi, assistant professor of sociology, was suspended without pay for one quarter for allegedly similar behavior dating since 1971.  A record of the incident will also be placed in Hermassi's permanent personnel file, university officials said.Spokesmen for both  universities said they believe their actions for sexual harassment were the most severe taken recently by any university in the county."
http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_20183348/uc-berkeley-professors-condemn-light-punishment-administrator,"BERKELEY — A growing chorus of voices is calling for the firing of a UC Berkeley administrator who helped triple her secret sex partner’s pay over five years.
Calling Diane Leite’s punishment “an affront” to the university, several UC Berkeley professors have asked the school’s provost to investigate how the matter was handled. They are aghast that, instead of firing her, the university reassigned Leite from her assistant vice chancellor post and will still pay her $175,000 a year.
“It’s an outrage,” said engineering professor Samer Madanat, one of at least 13 professors who signed the letter to Provost George Breslauer. “That’s all I can say.”
In addition to the letter from faculty members, about 150 people by Thursday afternoon had signed an online petition calling for Leite and her boyfriend, Jonathan Caniezo, to be fired.
Although Leite’s boss, Vice Chancellor Graham Fleming, has defended his handling of Leite’s punishment, the university said Thursday that the matter was not over.
“The administration is … reviewing compensation and classification issues that came to light in the course of the investigation,” UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof said in a written statement.				
The scandal was revealed Monday when this newspaper reported that Leite, 47, had given five raises in two years to Caniezo, 30, a subordinate employee with whom she had a sexual relationship. 
Caniezo made less than $41,000 in 2005, but his pay jumped to $120,000 in 2010, amid the affair, according to university records.				
The university approved the pay hikes over the objections of Caniezo’s supervisor, who later told investigators she did not believe he had earned them. 
As head of UC Berkeley’s office of administrative services for campus research, Leite supervised Caniezo’s boss, then later directly supervised him herself, according to a campus investigation launched in August after first an anonymous complaint and then a formal one exposed the relationship.
After the investigation, Leite was removed from her $188,000-a-year position but reassigned as an adviser to Fleming, the vice chancellor.
In their letter to Breslauer, the university’s chief academic officer, the professors criticized the “surprisingly mild measures” taken after Leite was discovered to have broken sexual-harassment policies.
“Having Diane Leite hold any position of responsibility or power on this campus is harmful to our institution,” the professors wrote. “We are surprised at the evident protection that has repeatedly been bestowed upon her, which, in our view, is counter to the interest of the university and to the morale of its faculty and staff.”
Breslauer did not respond to an interview request.
Investigators found that Leite had completed sexual-harassment training three times in recent years, but she told the university she was unaware her actions were wrong.
The solution is simple, said astronomy professor Leo Blitz: Fire Leite.
“For a highly paid administrator, this is not a small matter,” said Blitz, who signed the letter to Breslauer.
Leite’s attorney, Jane Brunner, did not respond to an interview request. Caniezo, who remains under investigation, did not respond to a message left at his Rodeo home.
In a piece published Wednesday in the student-run Daily Californian newspaper, biology professor Kevin Padian complained that “rules on this campus apply to everyone but the administrators.”
As a learning institution, a university should have higher standards than other employers, said Judy Nadler, a former Santa Clara mayor and now a senior fellow in government ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics.
“If (Leite’s violation) doesn’t rise to the level of significant punishment, what do you have to do to get fired?” Nadler said. “At a corporation, I think it’s pretty clear this wouldn’t be tolerated.”

Eight female employees interviewed by OPHD reported that Richard Sweitzer had rubbed their backs, patted them on the back or squeezed their shoulders in a way that was uncomfortable and unwelomed, violating UC sexual harassment policy. OPHD also found that the policy was violated when the department did not adequately address the conflict of interest created by Sweitzer's consenual relationship with a co-worker. Other employees said Sweitzer repeatedly made comments with sexual connotations, naming the ATVs ""Dick"" and ""Jane"" and referencing female employees ""riding Dick"" and male employees ""riding Jane.""

BuzzFeed News spoke to three of the four complainants in the investigation. One of the women, known as Complainant 3, studied astronomy as a graduate student. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she did not want her involvement in the matter to affect her current job.According to her account to Berkeley’s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination, she was at a post-colloquium dinner with her graduate department at the University of Hawaii when Marcy placed his hand on her leg, slid his hand up her thigh, and grabbed her crotch.She didn’t register an official complaint until eight years later, by which time she’d left astronomy — in part, she said, because of the sexual harassment she and other female astronomers experienced. “When you’re a student and you see every complaint being ignored, and every male professor who has violated that have zero consequences, it really makes you not want to step forward,” she said.In the investigation documents, Marcy stated that Complainant 3’s accusation was “totally absurd” and “plainly false,” and that he “would never touch the knee of someone I didn’t know.”In the documents, the investigator wrote: “Based on the preponderance of evidence, I find it more likely than not that [Marcy] acted as reported by Complainant 3.”Harvard astronomy professor John Asher Johnson was a graduate student in Marcy’s lab from 2000 to 2007. During his first few years in the lab, Johnson told BuzzFeed News, he directly witnessed Marcy giving an undergraduate a back massage, with his hand underneath her shirt, alone and after hours in the lab.Marcy, through his lawyer, denied this incident.“What’s really infuriating about this is that anybody of my generation in the field of exoplanets knows that Geoff does this,” Johnson said. “Everybody is so afraid of doing anything about it that they are afraid of speaking out, but everybody knows it.”Jessica Kirkpatrick, Complainant 4 in the investigation, was not herself harassed by Marcy, but told BuzzFeed News that she saw him get “inappropriately touchy” with an undergraduate one evening during the American Astronomical Society’s 2010 meeting in Washington, D.C. As the evening wore on, according to investigation documents, several people saw Marcy become more persistent.“It’s plausible,” Marcy told the investigator regarding the allegations of inappropriate touching. “It would have been a friendly touch if I did it at all,” the investigation documents quote him as explaining. “But I would never do it again.”Several people told BuzzFeed News that the incident is well-known among astronomers and that it was largely responsible for spurring the ensuing campus complaint.“He’s had a long history of behaving inappropriately, especially with undergraduates,” said Kirkpatrick, who at the time was a graduate student at Berkeley studying astrophysics. “Women discouraged other women from working with him as a research advisor. It was just something that was talked about pretty frankly among the women in the department.”Kirkpatrick, who has since left academia, continues to run the Women in Astronomy blog, through which she says three other women have approached her with accounts of their experiences with Marcy.Sarah Ballard decided to talk about her experience with Marcy after hearing that many other women had been through something similar, she told BuzzFeed News. Ballard, known in the Berkeley investigation as Complainant 2, participated anonymously in the proceedings.She was an undergraduate in Berkeley’s astronomy department when her roommate organized a rally against sexual assault and sexual violence, according to investigation documents. Marcy went to the rally, and Ballard, who was a student in his class, later emailed him to thank him for attending. Marcy responded saying Ballard should call him at his home, but she declined.At a coffee shop during her junior year, Marcy told Ballard about having sex outdoors with a woman he once dated, the documents say. In another instance, during the summer of 2005, Marcy gave Ballard a ride home from a cafe. Parked outside her home, she opened the car door and stuck her legs out to leave. Then he began to rub the back of her neck. “I felt fearful and uncomfortable,” she told BuzzFeed News.Marcy, through his lawyer, declined to comment to BuzzFeed News on Ballard’s accusations, and Marcy's response in the report is redacted.Ballard says she carried the confusion and shame of the event with her for years, until she heard about other women’s experiences and “realized it was a pattern — it wasn’t just me.”

Geoff Marcy has resigned from his tenured position as astronomy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, the school has confirmed.The announcement comes in the wake of a BuzzFeed News story that revealed a university investigation finding that Marcy had violated Berkeley's sexual harassment policies in several cases between 2001 and 2010.More than 2,500 academics have signed an online petition to ""support the people who were targets of Geoff Marcy's inappropriate behavior and those who have spoken publicly about it."" Late on Monday, dozens of Marcy's colleagues published statements calling for him to leave. ""It's a relief to know that Geoff Marcy will no longer have access to UC Berkeley students,"" Jessica Kirkpatrick, one of the complainants in the sexual harassment investigation, told BuzzFeed News. ""I hope the university is using this opportunity to re-evaluate it's process and policies so that vulnerable students have better protections in place to guard against sexual harassment from faculty moving forward.""Many academics are upset that Berkeley didn't take stronger disciplinary actions against Marcy after the investigation concluded that he had violated sexual harassment policies. He was given a ""strict set of behavioral standards"" to follow, and was told that if another complaint was filed, he could be sanctioned or fired.In a statement issued Wednesday afternoon, the university defended its decision not to fire Marcy, citing University of California policy. ""UC Berkeley's reaction to the finding that Professor Geoff Marcy violated the University's sexual harassment policies has been the subject of understandable criticism and anger,"" Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Claude Steele, said in the statement. ""We want to state unequivocally that Professor Marcy's conduct, as determined by the investigation, was contemptible and inexcusable.""Marcy has also resigned as principal investigator of the $100 million Breakthrough Listen project, a large scientific research program aimed at finding life beyond Earth. Marcy has not responded to a request for comment. This is a developing story. Check back for updates and follow BuzzFeed News on Twitter.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/10/uc-berkeley-students-professor-sexual-harassment-complaint,"Kathleen Gutierrez struggles to get out of bed each day. For the past year, the 28-year-old University of California at Berkeley graduate student has battled extreme fatigue, unexpected body aches and debilitating anxiety.At the root of her stress is her fear that at any moment on campus, she could run into Blake Wentworth, a professor in her department who she says repeatedly sexually harassed her – touching her inappropriately and frequently making offensive comments, including telling her “I’m so attracted to you” and bragging about doing drugs off of a stripper’s body.In October, records show, a university investigation concluded that Wentworth violated the college’s harassment policies and made “unwelcome sexual advances” toward her. But more than six months later, the professor has faced no discipline and remains employed at UC Berkeley – with an office two doors away from Gutierrez.“I don’t feel safe,” Gutierrez said in a recent interview. “That exhaustion, that’s physical and emotional at times, really weighs on me.”At least six other students have given recent testimonials expressing concerns about Wentworth, and several have filed complaints, according to a recent letter sent by multiple faculty members to supervisors.On Monday, Gutierrez and Erin Bennett, another graduate student who has accused Wentworth of harassment, intend to file formal complaints with the state against the professor and the University of California, alleging they have been subject to discrimination, sexual harassment and a hostile and intimidating work environment.The complaints with the state department of fair employment and housing – copies of which the students’ attorneys shared exclusively with the Guardian – set the stage for a possible lawsuit and mark a significant development in a sexual harassment scandal that has shaken the prestigious northern California public university.In October, Geoffrey Marcy, a prominent UC Berkeley astronomer, resigned following reports that he avoided serious discipline after the school determined that he had repeatedly sexually harassed students.In March, Sujit Choudhry, dean of UC Berkeley’s renowned law school, stepped down in the wake of faculty outrage that he was able to keep his job after the school substantiated sexual harassment allegations from his executive assistant.Following other high-profile harassment controversies, the university last week released hundreds of pages of investigation records involving 19 employees found guilty of misconduct by the school’s Office for the Prevention of Harassment and Discrimination (OPHD). The documents revealed that although 11 people resigned or were terminated, no faculty members were fired for sexual harassment.Wentworth, a tenure-track assistant professor in the department of south and south-east Asian studies, was one faculty member who has avoided termination despite findings of misconduct.Although it has been more than a year since Gutierrez and Bennett formally reported Wentworth for harassment, the university says disciplinary proceedings in his case are still pending.In official statements to the university and in emails to the Guardian, Wentworth vehemently denied all the allegations, which he called “baseless”. He was being “railroaded”, he said.In lengthy interviews, the women said they decided to file state complaints and speak publicly in the hope of protecting other students and to shine light on harassment that is pervasive at universities and workplaces across the country. They both said UC Berkeley’s inaction had been traumatizing and that they would not feel safe until Wentworth was removed from the school.I can't be on campus. I don't know what graduate school is like without harassment“I can’t be on campus,” said Bennett, a 25-year-old comparative literature student, who said she was forced to take medical leave due to the university’s handling of her case. “I don’t know what graduate school is like without harassment.”According to Bennett’s complaint, Wentworth encouraged the first-year graduate student to take a one-on-one independent study course during her first semester in fall 2014. Wentworth specializes in the Tamil language, which is Bennett’s area of interest.Immediately, the complaint says, Wentworth began talking about his personal life and making inappropriate comments, at one point saying that learning Tamil was “better than sex”. On different occasions, he also allegedly touched her hand, placed his hands on her shoulders and got physically very close to her.Bennett alleges in the complaint that the professor also often talked about his marriage, at one point “alluded to things he would do if Ms Bennett were his wife” and once calling her his “poor little lamb”.“I became increasingly uncomfortable with his behavior,” Bennett said in an interview. “The power dynamic was very strong and palpable.”Even though Wentworth is the only expert in Tamil literature at the university, Bennett said she dropped the class and tried to put the experience behind her.Gutierrez, who is an instructor in Wentworth’s department, said the professor would frequently visit an office for grad students and make inappropriate sexual comments.On 17 February last year, her state complaint says, Wentworth asked her to take a walk with him, and once outside he “began to talk about his recent divorce, visiting a strip club, and doing drugs [off] of a stripper’s body”. He also allegedly grabbed her hand and said: “I could lose my job over this … but I’m just so attracted to you.”After she had made clear she was uncomfortable, Wentworth later came up behind her and wrapped his hands around her head and ear, according to the complaint.“It was so disturbing to me to know that was happening in my workplace, that he made such an assertive come-on to me,” Gutierrez said in an interview. “I remember being very scared to think I might be alone with him.”Both women said they were initially reluctant to report Wentworth, because they felt ashamed and feared retaliation. But once they learned that other students had similar concerns about him, they came forward and began a reporting process that they said was long, confusing and unfriendly to victims.Though they both reported Wentworth in the spring, it was not until October that OPHD issued its findings, determining the professor had violated policies in Gutierrez’s case.But in Bennett’s case OPHD said Wentworth’s actions “were not sufficiently severe or pervasive” to constitute sexual harassment, concluding that his conduct toward her was “unprofessional, and exhibited poor personal boundaries”.Bennett said the decision was devastating and that she became too distraught to return to campus. As a result, she took leave, which eventually caused problems with her scholarships and health insurance.“I don’t have any faith in Berkeley’s independent judicial system,” she said. “What’s most important to me is that this doesn’t happen anymore.”In Gutierrez’s case, two committees subsequently had to review the case, which meant she had to re-tell the harassment allegations to another set of strangers – a process she said was particularly painful.If a faculty committee recommends termination, according to UC Berkeley spokesman Dan Mogulof, the UC board of regents will have to vote to approve the decision. Mogulof declined to comment on pending litigation, but noted that the university recently formed a committee on sexual violence and harassment and is reviewing policies and procedures for reporting and investigating complaints.“There needs to be improvement in our policies and our practices and our culture on this campus,” Mogulof told the Guardian earlier in the week.In a series of lengthy emails, Wentworth wrote: “The reason my ‘cases’ have not been treated with severity is that they are, and have been proven to be, fanciful.”He denied saying he was attracted to Gutierrez or ever mentioning strippers, said he never used the phrase “poor little lamb” and said he always makes boundaries clear – that “there can be no romantic relationship between professors and students ever”.Wentworth told investigators he likely made the “if you were my wife” comment to Bennett as part of a grammar and culture lesson.I state emphatically that the accusations are unjust and unmeritedWentworth denied ever inappropriately touching either woman, saying Bennett lied about his physical contact and calling her a “troubled young woman”. He said that as soon as he learned students were “bothered” by him, he stopped communicating with them outside of his classes.“I state emphatically that the accusations are unjust and unmerited,” he wrote.Speaking to the Guardian, Gutierrez started crying when describing how hard it is for young women in academia, especially minority women, to complete their studies without facing discrimination and harassment.“This place isn’t made for people that look like us. How am I supposed to get through the demands of graduate school when I know that my colleagues are going through this?” said Gutierrez, who is Filipina.“People wonder why women of color don’t make it.”Gutierrez said she has been forced to change offices for fears of encountering Wentworth and tries to avoid her department’s building as much as possible.“My body is just collapsing under all of this,” she said, “but … I am so committed to staying, because it just infuriates me to think that anybody else might go through this in the future.”If you have information about this story contact: sam.levin@theguardian.com "
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/24/sexual-harassment-university-california-berkeley-blake-wentworth,"The University of California has fired a professor who was accused of sexually harassing multiple students, nearly two years after campus investigators first concluded he had made unwanted advances and violated school policies.The dismissal of assistant professor Blake Wentworth – who sued the women who filed harassment complaints against him – marks a rare instance of termination of a faculty member accused of sexual misconduct at the prestigious public university.The allegations that Wentworth, a professor of south and south-east Asian studies at UC Berkeley, sexually harassed and inappropriately touched female students he was overseeing contributed to a major scandal, prompting an international debate about sexism and discrimination in academia.Two graduate students and one undergraduate shared their accounts with the Guardian last year, arguing that Wentworth’s mistreatment of them had derailed their studies and, careers and that the university had repeatedly failed to support them and hold the faculty member accountable.Attorneys for Wentworth – who filed a defamation suit against the three women in September and has sued the university – said in a statement on Wednesday that the university was trying to distract from a financial scandal, and that he continues to deny the “false assertions, which are a pretext to discriminate and retaliate against him”.Evidence in his pending lawsuit will show that UC embarked on a “campaign to ruin his career”, the lawyers added.It’s unclear why the decision to terminate Wentworth took so long. The university substantiated the first claim of harassment against one of the graduate students in October 2015, and the three women filed formal complaints with state investigators more than a year ago.The university concluded that Wentworth made unwelcome sexual advances against grad student Kathleen Gutierrez, who accused Wentworth of grabbing her hand and saying: “I could lose my job over this … but I’m just so attracted to you.” He also allegedly came up behind her and wrapped his hands around her head and made offensive comments about a strip club.Erin Bennett, the other grad student, accused Wentworth of inappropriately touching her and making comments about sex during their one-on-one independent study in her first semester at the school. The process of reporting the harassment took a toll on her mental health and led her to take a leave of absence, she said.Wentworth, a tenure-track professor, allegedly told undergraduate student Nicole Hemenway that she was a “gorgeous young woman”, calling her “honey bear” and saying that others in the department were “jealous that such beautiful young women are always coming and going from my office”.On Wednesday, Hemenway said that the dismissal would not have happened if the students hadn’t devoted significant resources to fighting the case.“This firing was our doing. The university gets to put their name on the decision, but they were perfectly happy not doing anything,” she said by phone. “This was because of student organizing efforts.”Hemenway, 25, noted that the delay in the decision has prevented her from potentially applying to grad school at Berkeley or taking classes on the campus. “There’s no sign that it’ll be any easier for the next set of women who come forward.”Public records released this year on sexual harassment investigations revealed patterns in how powerful UC faculty target vulnerable students under their purview. Tenured faculty members have typically avoided serious consequences after the university found they violated policies, resulting in them stepping down only after negative media coverage.“These actions are part of the University’s continuing effort to eradicate sexual misconduct from our campus,” the university said in a statement on Wednesday. “The harassment of students by faculty represents an unacceptable breach of the teacher-student relationship and carries the potential for enormous harm.”The university said the dismissal, effective immediately, came after the completion of a “standard process for adjudication of faculty conduct issues”, which included multiple investigations, reviews and a hearing. Wentworth was relieved of teaching duties in June of 2016 and had been on leave pending the outcome of the disciplinary proceedings."

Blake Wentworth
Assistant professor in the department of South East Asian studies
Two female complainants alleged that Blake Wentworth had made sexual comments and innuendos and physical contact that was unwelcome and made them feel uncomfortable. They alleged that he made inappropriate statements, including about the sexual practice of fisting and taking drugs at the Burning Man event. One complainant also alleged that Wentworth insinuated he wanted to begin a romantic relationship with her, despite the fact that she firmly stated she did not wish to do so. Wentworth denied any ""quid pro quo"" type of conversation and that he touched the complainant's hand.

OPHD found Howard Dâabrera's repeatedly emailed a student with invitations to Hawaii and other destinations, mentioning orgies and threatening to lower the student's grade if they did not accept the invitation. Though D'abrera denies any sexual intent to his emails and communications, OPHD found D'abrera had more likely than not violated UC sexual harassment policy. He was placed on administrative leave the day the complaint was filed and later resigned in January.

A UC Berkeley professor has been found in violation of the university's sexual harassment policy after a graduate student came forward and accused him of making sexual advancements over a four-year period.

The student, Ph.D. candidate Eva Hagberg Fisher, 34, said Architecture Professor Nezar AlSayyad touched her inappropriately, made himself out to be a protector and repeatedly asked her out.

One troubling incident stood out to Hagberg Fisher.

""He hugged me in the hallway and said, 'I hope you feel as good as you look,' which was five minutes before the most important exam of my professional career,"" she recalled. ""It was distressing and troubling.

""In the summer of 2013 began the physical escalation,"" Hagberg Fisher continued, ""asking me to come out with him for dinner, asking if he could take me for drinks, telling me he loved me.""

Last week, an independent investigator concluded AlSayyad, 61, violated the university's sexual harrassment policy.

On Tuesday, students protested outside the School of Architecture, calling on UC Berkeley officials to take swift action. Campus officials have barred AlSayyad from teaching next semester, according to a report in the San Francisco Chronicle. The newspaper also reported there were two other complaints of sexual misconduct against the professor in the 1990s.


""We feel strongly this is not a safe place right now, with him continuing to be in the classroom,"" student protester Justine Marcus said. ""He should be removed immediately.""

Dozens of students have signed and sent a petition to UC leaders demanding the professor's dismissal. Several students have refused to attend his classes, requesting alternative ways to finish the semester's work, according to SFGate.

But AlSayyad's attorney, Dan Siegel, has urged students not to jump to conclusions until a hearing takes place. He said the professor has done nothing wrong and Hagberg Fisher never indicated AlSayyad's conduct or behavior was in any way uncomfortable or unpleasant.

But Hagberg Fisher said she was humiliated, and she felt strongly that any victim of sexual harassment should not have to endure what she went through.

""I don't want any student in any university to feel she can't come forward,"" she said. ""I don't want any student to feel if this happens to her she has to stay silent. That's why I'm coming forward with my name, with my face, with my body.""

https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2023/07/02/appeals-court-upholds-suspension-of-uc-berkeley-professor-for-sexual-harassment/,"A state appeals court has upheld the suspension of a disgraced UC Berkeley architecture professor who lost his job after claims of sexual harassment from a former graduate student came to light.
Nezar AlSayyad — an internationally recognized scholar who started teaching within the university’s Architecture and City and Regional Planning departments in 1985 — opted to retire in 2018 instead of serving a three-year suspension without pay for violating the university’s code of conduct.
However, AlSayyad, who was born in Cairo, Egypt, promptly sued the UC Regents over the sanctions, seeking damages from what he felt was a “weak case” against him that was based on discrimination of his national origin.
Following a five-month investigation into the allegations, UC Chancellor Carol Christ handed down the discipline in August of 2018. She overturned a one-year suspension that had previously been recommended by a committee that oversaw tenured and privileged professors, which rejected many accusations but ruled that AlSayyad made a “momentary overstep.”
AlSayyad claimed that the Regents “failed to establish a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason” why Christ could overrule the previous committee recommendation, according to court documents. He also argued that in the years prior to his own suspension, the university “imposed penalties less harsh” on other, non-Egyptian faculty members facing similar complaints of sexual harassment.
At the time, his attorney, Dan Siegel said that AlSayyad’s reputation had wrongly been “left in tatters” over the matter.				
The First District Court of Appeals disagreed.
According to a June 7 filing, investigators found a “preponderance of evidence” supporting accusations that AlSayyad in 2016 sexually harassed Eva Hagberg Fisher, his subordinate in the department, and engaged in divisive, manipulative and harassing behavior. The complaints ranged from repeated requests for dinner dates, physically intimate touches and a proposal for an paid trip to Las Vegas.				
Additionally, before the student took her qualifying exam for her Ph.D., AlSayyad allegedly told her that he “hoped she felt as good as she looked” and later offered her a job as a research assistant.
AlSayyad referred questions to his lawyer; Siegel said both he and his client were disappointed by the ruling.
He said employment discrimination cases that challenge disciplinary action are inherently difficult, because that places a burden on the plaintiff to show that they were treated differently than others in similar situations. However, when involving these types of allegations, he argued that there are rarely people who are in exactly identical situations that can be compared.
“That creates a gray area for the court, and I think this court really took advantage of that to accept the university’s idea that the comparators were different,” Siegel said in an interview. “I had hoped that the Court of Appeal would take the issues on more straightforwardly, but it seems that they did not want to put themselves in a position where they were disagreeing with the conclusions reached by the Chancellor at UC Berkeley.”
According to the June ruling, Christ testified that her decision to pursue the longer suspension was based on AlSayyad’s “continuing failure to accept responsibility for the impact of [his] behavior,” which she and other administrators called “egregious.”
Additionally, Vice Provost Hermalin testified that AlSayyad’s behavior included “grooming the student, isolating the student, providing the student with false information that harmed her career, involving the student in departmental politics and sexually harassing the student, including touching her.”
The court agreed with these arguments, and also ruled that the other professors AlSayyad claimed were given less harsh consequences had each expressed remorse — either negotiating settlements or accepting a suspension.
While the appeals court ruling is legally the end of the line for AlSayyad, Siegel added that the retired professor continues to maintain that his actions with the former graduate student were part of an “appropriate professional and personal relationship” — meaning there was no reason for him to express remorse.
AlSayyad also challenged the due process of the decision in 2018, but that petition was denied by a trial court in May 2019.
By retiring, he was able to collect his pension and health benefits from UC Berkeley, where he earned $211,000 a year. However, that choice meant that his emeritus status was curtailed for three years.
AlSayyad’s profile is currently active on the university’s website, and a UC Berkeley spokesperson said his emeritus status was reactivated by Aug. 2021. Additionally, while AlSayyad was barred from campus in 2018 through June 2021, that restriction has since been resolved.

http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama A&M University fired a tenured professor in March after the school discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on campus, according to court documents. The school severed ties with Edward Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama A&M. Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification. According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M campus, the school said. Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns. Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit. The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M police executed a search warrant, according to court documents. Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M informed Jones he would be fired. ""There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file. According to a memo from Alabama A&M police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012. Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer. In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M administration for ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation."" Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act. ""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,"" the lawsuit stated. In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross professional misconduct."" ""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative. ""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus.""

In it, Shirley Hoogstra, Calvin's vice president for student life, said the student alleged in May this year she had carried out the relationship with biology professor Steve Matheson. ""Calvin has strict policies against sexual harassment and this relationship violated Calvin's policies,"" Hoogstra said in the letter. ""These policies recognize there is a power differential between faculty and students. After being confronted by the college with this report, the professor resigned rather than face termination."" The letter goes on to say Calvin administrators launched an ""extensive internal review and investigation,"" which led to the formation of a task force on the matter. The task force was set up to ""educate and protect our community so we can learn together how to prevent and properly address allegations of sexual harassment,"" according to Hoogstra's letter. The task force's formation delayed the news being brought before students because it only recently began meeting, Hoogstra said in the letter. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon so students could discuss the matter with Student Senate and school officials. FOX-17 first reported Friday's letter had been sent out.

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to seek out such material. ""My childhood and teen years put some context around what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday, July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City.  Merrill, 58, whose CMU research included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not excuse such conduct. “I never harmed a child, but I understand children were abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said. Before Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material. “I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those individuals,” Merrill said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that Merrill’s collection depicted  children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90 percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon violence toward children, Dill said. Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year felony. Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous Merrill apologized to them and to CMU. Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds, said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment. Merrill told Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn. “I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child pornography,"" he said. Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records. A member of the university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff alerted university police of the content. Questioned by police, Merrill said he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have any more such material. Police in November executed a search warrant at Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers. Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487 images of child porn and 26 similar videos. Merrill resigned from his tenured position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor weapons offense. Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case. A federal grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/09/investigation_found_professor.html,"Delta College.jpg Delta College ( ) BAY CITY, MI -- After two female students accused a professor of making inappropriate sexual advances toward them, Delta College's own investigation concluded it was likely the instructor indeed harassed them. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff on July 12 filed the lawsuit on behalf of Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski in Bay County Circuit Court. Named as defendants in the suit are Delta College and former Professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Mason and Jablonski are seeking damages in excess of $25,000, claiming they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they allege. Via a Freedom of Information Act request, The Times obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta College. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22 and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16. Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, the suit and the summary state. Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college. Fonville resigned from Delta Collegeo n Nov. 24, before Brown completed the investigation. Mason and Jablonski's suit asserts they are owed damages under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. The act prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status"" in employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations. In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denies any wrongdoing. The school denies ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Attorney Lenhoff, representing the plaintiffs, has said this response doesn't jibe with Brown's findings. ""This is inconsistent with the investigative report of Delta's Title IX coordinator,"" Lenhoff previously told The Times. ""Delta itself found the credibility of Emily and MaCayla to be high. It found Fonville's credibility was low. Delta found that there was sexual harassment here. I'm surprised at the answer and the answer's allegation is not so. ""Professors and teachers must understand affairs with students and sexual advances on students are just completely inappropriate,"" he continued. ""This case really touches on a major national issue."" Fonville is represented by attorney Anne McClorey McLaughlin of Farmington Hills-based Johnson, Rosati, Schultz & Joppich. ""My client denies that any communication he had with the plaintiffs had any impact on their studies at Delta College,"" McLaughlin said. ""It occurred outside of the time he was their instructor."" Fonville currently lives in Tennessee and was served with the suit there, Lenhoff said. The case is slated for a settlement conference before Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Tuesday, June 13, 2017. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama A&M University fired a tenured professor in March after the school discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on campus, according to court documents.The school severed ties with Edward Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama A&M. Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification.According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M campus, the school said.Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns.Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit.The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M police executed a search warrant, according to court documents.Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M informed Jones he would be fired.""There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file.According to a memo from Alabama A&M police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012.Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer.In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M administration for ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation.""Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act.""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,"" the lawsuit stated.In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross professional misconduct.""""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative.""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus."""
https://casetext.com/case/longmire-v-alabama-state-university,"               ORDER              CARROLL, United States Magistrate Judge.            I. INTRODUCTION             On June 11, 1991, the plaintiff, Venus Longmire, filed this action pro se against  Alabama State University (ASU); Joe Reed, the Chairman of the Alabama State University Board of Trustees; and Leon Howard, a former president of Alabama State. Ms. Longmire alleged that the defendants had violated rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and that Dr. Howard had committed a battery upon her, had falsely imprisoned her, had intentionally inflicted emotional distress upon her, and had defamed her. On September 13, 1991, Ms. Longmire, this time through counsel, filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint added all of the university trustees as defendants and redefined the claims. The claims as redefined are:    (1) That Ms. Longmire was sexually harassed in violation of rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (2) That Ms. Longmire was terminated from her employment in retaliation for her filing of a charge with the EEOC in violation of rights guaranteed her by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; (3) That Alabama State University and its trustees negligently and wantonly failed to supervise Dr. Howard; (4) That Dr. Howard committed an assault and battery on Ms. Longmire; (5) That Dr. Howard invaded Ms. Longmire's privacy; (6) That Dr. Howard committed the tort of outrage against Ms. Longmire; (7) That all of the defendants breached a contract which they had with Ms. Longmire.            On October 13, 1991, Dr. Howard filed a counterclaim against Ms. Longmire which alleges that Ms. Longmire abused legal process and defamed him by accusing him of having attempted to rape her. Ms. Longmire, through counsel, filed a "" third amended complaint"" on January 13, 1992. The complaint added a claim that the sexual harassment also violated the Civil Rights Act of 1991. It also added claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for sexual discrimination and for violation of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. A "" fourth amended complaint"" was filed on September 23, 1992. That complaint added a claim against Dr. Joe Reed alleging that Dr. Reed violated Ms. Longmire's constitutional rights by terminating her employment because she filed a complaint with the state Ethics Commission.    A second amended complaint was filed which simply changed the name of one of the trustees.            On July 31, 1992, United States District Judge Myron Thompson issued an order on the defendants' motions to dismiss. A supplemental order was filed on October 22, 1992. According to the terms of those orders, the only claims which Ms. Longmire may pursue against the trustees of Alabama State University are claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for injunctive relief in their official capacities. Alabama State University remains a defendant for purpose of the Title VII claim and Dr. Howard remains a defendant for the Title VII claims, the § 1983 claims, and the state law claims for assault, invasion of privacy, and outrageous conduct.            This case is currently pending on a series of discovery disputes. The issues have been briefed by the parties and the court held oral argument on the various issues on December 11, 1992.            II. DISCUSSION            The discovery phase of this case has been marked by hostility, anger and a general inability on the part of counsel to get along. The taking of depositions is almost always marked by scheduling problems. When the scheduling problems are resolved and the depositions commence, the court can always anticipate receiving calls from counsel to make rulings on problems which occur during the depositions. The difficulties with the depositions and the daily phone calls to the court caused the court to issue an extensive order concerning the conduct of counsel during depositions. The order was issued on October 7, 1992.             The court has had to involve itself in the minutiae of the discovery process. On November 6, 1992, the court was required to issue an order concerning the length of questioning during the plaintiff's deposition because of the inability of counsel to resolve the issue. Since October 30, 1992, at least nine  separate discovery motions have been filed. The court has held hearings on discovery matters on October 8, October 26, November 5, and December 11. It has issued orders on discovery matters on October 6, October 7, October 8, October 15, October 28, and November 6.            A. THE ISSUES IN JUDGE THOMPSON'S ORDER OF NOVEMBER 20            The serious discovery disputes in this case began on October 6, 1992 when the parties began taking depositions. The bulk of the disputes in this case have centered around the desire of counsel for Dr. Howard and Ms. Longmire to inquire, in deposition, about each others previous sexual activity. On October 15, 1992, this court entered an order limiting that inquiry. The parties then filed various pleadings asking that the limits on the inquiry about the sexual activities be changed. On October 28, 1992, the court entered another order relating to the scope of the parties inquiry about sexual activity. Under the terms of that order, counsel for the defendants were allowed to ask Ms. Longmire about her sexual activity with other persons while she was employed at Alabama State about which Dr. Howard had knowledge. Counsel for Ms. Longmire was allowed to ask questions about sexual activities which Dr. Howard may have had with persons with whom he had a supervisor/supervisee relationship or employer/employee relationship during his most recent term at Alabama State. All of the parties appealed the October 28 order.            Following a hearing on the appeal of the October 28 order, Judge Thompson, on November 20, 1992, issued an order directing the undersigned magistrate judge to review certain discovery issues which the parties had not yet presented. A hearing was held on those discovery issues on December 11, 1992. Each of those issues will be discussed in turn.   The district judge's order of November 20, 1992 also requested that the magistrate judge resolve the question of whether Ms. Longmire had laid sufficient predicate to inquire into certain alleged sexual relationships of Dr. Howard. That issue was resolved during the hearing which the magistrate judge held on November 20.            1. LONGMIRE'S INQUIRY INTO HOWARD'S ACTIVITIES AT JACKSON STATE            Dr. Howard left Alabama State to go to Jackson State University in 1976. He returned to Alabama State in 1984. Ms. Longmire contends that she should be allowed to ask Dr. Howard questions about his sexual activity with women other than his wife while he was employed at Jackson State and during his first employment at Alabama State.    These dates were provided to the court by the parties in open court during the December 11th hearing.             The limits which the court has placed on the inquiry about Dr. Howard's sexual activity on the Title VII and § 1983 claims by this court's order of October 28, 1992 appear appropriate under the case law. Evidence of Dr. Howard's sexual activities with women at Alabama State while Dr. Howard was employed there is relevant to the sexual harassment issues before the court. In Hicks v. Gates Rubber Co., 833 F.2d 1406, 1415 (10th Cir.1987), the court found that evidence of other acts of sexual harassment involving other employees was admissible in determining the "" hostile environment"" issue. See also Sowers v. Kemira, Inc., 701 F.Supp. 809, 813 (S.D.Ga.1988); Weiss v. Amoco Oil Co., 142 F.R.D. 311 (S.D.Iowa 1992). It is equally clear, however, that Dr. Howard's activities outside the work place are irrelevant. Tomson v. Stephan, 705 F.Supp. 530, 536 (D.Kan.1989).             The only argument which the Ms. Longmire makes is that evidence of Dr. Howard's activities at Jackson State are relevant to show that the university trustees knew or should have known that Dr. Howard engaged in improper sexual activities at Jackson State before they hired him. Unfortunately for Ms. Longmire, there is no issue before the court which requires any inquiry into what the university trustees knew when  they hired Dr. Howard in 1984. The negligent supervision claim which the plaintiff raised in her amended complaint has been dismissed. The only claims remaining before the court involving either the trustees or the university are the sexual harassment claims. The trustees' knowledge of Dr. Howard's sexual activity while at Jackson State are irrelevant to those claims.             The plaintiff has never specifically categorized her sexual harassment claim as either a "" quid pro quo"" claim or a "" hostile environment"" claim. If the plaintiff's claim is a "" quid pro quo"" claim, a theory of strict liability applies. If the plaintiff's claim is a "" hostile environment"" claim, she can prevail against the university defendants only if she shows that the defendants knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action against Dr. Howard. Steele v. Offshore Shipbuilding, Inc., 867 F.2d 1311, 1316 (11th Cir.1989). In either case, the trustees' knowledge of Dr. Howard's sexual activities at Jackson State or at ASU during his previous tenure is absolutely irrelevant.            This case has been marked by open hostility between counsel for the parties. It is important that this court place limits on inquiries into sensitive areas such as sexual activity in order to control the case. The limitations which the court has placed on the examination of Dr. Howard are consonant with both the letter and the spirit of Rule 26 and necessary to prevent unnecessary embarrassment and invasions of Dr. Howard's private life.            The court wishes to note, however, that its ruling is based on the present state of the record. If the plaintiff has actual evidence, not argument, which would establish a good faith basis for the inquiry about Dr. Howard's sexual activity at places other than Alabama State and some relevance to that inquiry, the plaintiff may make an ex parte motion under seal requesting that the court allow such inquiry.            2. HOWARD AND THE 404(B) EVIDENCE             The interests which Dr. Howard possesses in being free from harassment, embarrassment, and unnecessary invasions into his private life are also possessed by Ms. Longmire. She too has the right to be protected from an invasive inquiry which is irrelevant for discovery purposes. Indeed, courts need to be particularly vigilant in controlling discovery in sexual harassment cases. Priest v. Rotary, 98 F.R.D. 755, 761 (N.D.Cal.1983). In this case, Dr. Howard argues that evidence about Ms. Longmire's prior sexual activity is relevant because such evidence may be admissible under Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence.             Under Rule 404(b):    Evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.            Dr. Howard argues that he should be allowed to inquire into Ms. Longmire's sexual history because "" it is submitted that evidence of any prior instance in which the plaintiff may have been engaged in sexual relationships with individuals in authority over her, resulting in the plaintiff accepting money or favors from such individuals after they have been placed in a compromising position, would be relevant to the plaintiff's motive, plan, or scheme in this case."" This sort of generalized allegation that there might be some 404(b) evidence somewhere in the case is insufficient to overcome the "" potential of the requested discovery to harass, intimidate and discourage the plaintiff in her efforts to prosecute her cause."" Priest, 98 F.R.D. at 761. "" Questions remote in time or place to the working environment are wholly irrelevant and unlikely to lead to admissible evidence. Such questions would only serve as tools of annoyance and harassment and serve no purpose."" Mitchell v. Hutchings, 116 F.R.D. 481, 485 (D.Utah 1987).             As with the ruling concerning the scope of the inquiry into Dr. Howard's past, this ruling is based on the record before the court. If the defendants have actual evidence, as opposed to argument, which would establish  a good faith basis for the inquiry about Ms. Longmire's past sexual activity and some relevance to it, they may make an ex parte motion under seal requesting that the court allow such inquiry.            3. LIMITS OF DISCOVERY ON THE DEFAMATION CLAIM             Ms. Longmire makes the further argument that she should be allowed to inquire into Dr. Howard's past sexual activities because Dr. Howard has filed a defamation action against her. Under well-settled Alabama law, a person who files a defamation action puts his or her character in issue. Parker v. Newman, 200 Ala. 103, 75 So. 479, 485 (1917). In a defamation action, the plaintiff may offer evidence of his good character and his character with reference to the matter charged in the defamation. Webb v. Gray, 181 Ala. 408, 62 So. 194, 198 (1913). See also Bill Steber Chevrolet-Oldsmobile, Inc. v. Morgan, 429 So.2d 1013, 1015 (Ala.1983). The defendant may then offer evidence of the plaintiff's bad character. Webb v. Gray, 62 So. at 198. Because Dr. Howard has placed his character "" in issue"" by filing a defamation action, his good or bad character may be proven by specific instances of his conduct. Fed.R.Evid. 405(b); Government of the Virgin Islands v. Grant, 775 F.2d 508, 511 (3rd Cir.1985).             In this case, Dr. Howard claims that he has been defamed by Ms. Longmire's statement that he attempted to rape her. Consequently, counsel for Ms. Longmire may ask Dr. Howard about any incidents where he is alleged to have assaulted other females or attempted to force them to have sex with him against their wills. If Dr. Howard intends to offer evidence of his general good character, then counsel for Ms. Longmire is free to ask questions about any extra-marital affair that Dr. Howard may have had while he was either at Jackson State or Alabama State.            B. THE OTHER PENDING DISCOVERY ISSUES            1. DISCOVERY FROM THE ASU TRUSTEES            The plaintiff has propounded a series of interrogatories to the individual members of the Alabama State University Board of Trustees. The court has reviewed the interrogatories and much of the information which the plaintiff seeks is beyond the knowledge of the trustees. During the hearing which was held in this case on December 11, counsel for the plaintiff indicated that she was requesting only that the trustees answer interrogatories directed to their personal knowledge of facts which are relevant to this case. The ASU trustees contend that they cannot be compelled to answer the interrogatories but that they will make themselves available for deposition and will respond to subpoenas duces tecum. The basis for the trustees' contentions is the order of the court granting them summary judgment on the issue of qualified immunity. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). The trustees' contention misapprehends the law.             The damage claim against the trustees in their individual capacities has been dismissed. They still remain as defendants in their official capacities for purposes of injunctive relief. Under well-settled law, the defense of qualified immunity is "" totally immaterial"" to claims for injunctive relief. Tubbesing v. Arnold, 742 F.2d 401, 404 (8th Cir.1984). Indeed, in cases where injunctive relief is requested, discovery should go forward even where defendants have prevailed on their qualified immunity defense. See, e.g., Lugo v. Alvarado, 819 F.2d 5 (1st Cir.1987). There are, of course, cases where parties remain as defendants after they have successfully litigated their qualified immunity defense because there is some susceptibility to injunctive relief. In such a case where a defendant remains for purposes of injunctive relief only and has no knowledge of the underlying facts of the case, no discovery from that defendant should be permitted. However, defendants who are in a case solely for injunctive relief purposes but who have knowledge of the facts of a case may be subjected to discovery even if their qualified immunity defense has been successful. Denton v. Twyford, 142 F.R.D. 140 (S.D.Ohio 1992).            In this case, the plaintiff has argued to the court that the trustees have personal knowledge of critical facts in this case. The trustees have presented no contrary evidence. Consequently, the trustees can be compelled to answer the plaintiff's interrogatories but only insofar as the interrogatories seek information about the trustees' personal knowledge or relevant facts. The only interrogatories which appear to the court to relate to the personal knowledge of the trustees are interrogatories 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 24 and 28.   The plaintiff's counsel served identical sets of interrogatories on ASU and its trustees. As a result, many of the interrogatories and requests for production of documents which are contained in the interrogatories to the trustees have nothing to do with the trustees. This absolute lack of specificity contributes unnecessary confusion. Unfortunately for ASU and the trustees, no objections to the interrogatories were filed within the time permitted by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Had objections been made, the court would have directed plaintiff's counsel to file new interrogatories.            2. THE MARITAL PRIVILEGE ISSUE            During the deposition of Dr. Howard's wife, Caroline Howard, counsel for Dr. Howard repeatedly invoked the marital privilege and instructed Mrs. Howard not to answer the question. The plaintiff filed a motion to compel answers to those questions on November 16 and on November 30. The court has reviewed the questions to which the marital privilege was asserted. The court, during the hearing which was held on December 11, indicated its view that in certain instances the assertion of the privilege was proper but that in other instances the assertion of the privilege was frivolous. Counsel for the parties then agreed to meet to narrow the focus of the motion to compel.            3. LONGMIRE'S PRESENCE DURING DOCUMENT PRODUCTION             Plaintiff's counsel has insisted that Ms. Longmire be present during the production of documents. ASU and its trustees have objected to her presence during the production of personnel files. The decision as to whether a plaintiff should have personal access to personnel files during the discovery process requires that the competing interests be balanced. See, e.g., Rossini v. Ogilvy and Mather, Inc. 798 F.2d 590, 601 (2d Cir.1986). In this case, plaintiff's counsel has indicated to the court that the plaintiff's presence will make document production more efficient because of the plaintiff's personal knowledge of the case. The defendants have offered no evidence to the court that the plaintiff is likely to disseminate confidential information which she obtains during the course of discovery. Consequently, the oral motion of the defendants to exclude the plaintiff from production of the personnel files should be denied. See Cobb v. Rockefeller University, 1991 WL 222125, 1991 U.S.Dist. LEXIS 15278 (S.D.N.Y. October 24, 1991) (Plaintiff in a sex discrimination lawsuit should be allowed access to files of former colleagues even though those files contain confidential information about hiring and tenure.) Ms. Longmire is cautioned, however, that she will be required to abide by any order of this court concerning non-disclosure of information.            C. MISCELLANEOUS DISCOVERY ISSUES            1. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL FILED ON NOVEMBER 16            On November 16, 1992, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel seeking an order directing ASU and its trustees to respond to certain interrogatories and document requests. The question of whether the trustees must answer interrogatories has been discussed above. The issue of document production has been discussed at both the November 20 hearing and the December 11 hearing. On December 14, ASU was to produce the documents requested. Accordingly, the motion to compel is due to be granted insofar as it applies to the interrogatories directed to the ASU trustees. It is to be otherwise denied as moot, subject to renewal if the documents requested are not produced.            2. ASU'S MOTION FOR PROTECTIVE ORDER FILED DECEMBER 7             On December 7, 1992, ASU filed a motion for protective order concerning the scheduling  of certain depositions. The parties have agreed to a deposition schedule and the motion is, therefore, moot.            3. PLAINTIFF'S MOTION TO COMPEL AND FOR SANCTIONS FILED ON DECEMBER 14            On December 14, 1992, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel relating to the deposition of Colonel Clarence Holloway. ASU arranged for Colonel Holloway to be deposed on the afternoon of December 14. Consequently, the motion to compel is moot. The motion for sanctions still remains.            III. CONCLUSION            For the foregoing reasons, it is hereby ORDERED:            (1) That inquiry into sexual activities of Ms. Longmire and Dr. Howard with other persons be limited according to the terms of this court's order of October 28, 1992 with the following modification:    Ms. Longmire, through counsel, may question Dr. Howard about any incidents where he is alleged to have assaulted other females or attempted to force them to have sex with him since Dr. Howard has placed his character in issue by filing a claim for defamation. If Dr. Howard intends to offer evidence of his general good character, then counsel for Ms. Longmire is free to ask questions of Dr. Howard about any extra-marital affair he may have had since his initial employment at Alabama State;            (2) That the parties may file an ex parte motion under seal to expand the scope of the inquiry concerning sexual activities with other persons. The motion should contain, at a minimum, a recitation of the evidence which exists concerning the sexual activity about which the parties seek to inquire and a brief showing the relevance of the evidence. For example, if Dr. Howard wishes to inquire about an incident of sexual activity involving Ms. Longmire which occurred outside of the work place, he may file an ex parte motion under seal seeking leave of court to make such an inquiry. The motion should recite the evidence which he has concerning the sexual activity and the source of that evidence and a brief showing how evidence of that sexual activity is relevant under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. If Ms. Longmire wishes to inquire about Dr. Howard's activity while he was at Jackson State, for example, she may file an ex parte motion under seal which recites the evidence which she has regarding that sexual activity and the source of the evidence and a brief showing how evidence of that sexual activity is relevant under Rule 26 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Upon a showing that there is a good faith basis for the inquiry and a showing that the inquiry is relevant, the court will issue and order permitting the inquiry. Such ex parte motions must be made in sufficient time to allow the court to consider the motion, issue a ruling and allow redeposition of either Dr. Howard or Ms. Longmire before the discovery cut-off date unless all parties agree that the redeposition may occur after that date;            (3) That the plaintiff's motion to compel filed on November 16, 1992 directed to the ASU trustees be granted in part and denied in part as follows. The ASU trustees shall serve full and complete answers to the following interrogatories on or before December 24, 1992: Interrogatories 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 24, 28 and 29. The motion to compel is denied as moot insofar as it relates to the production of documents. The motions, however, may be renewed;            (4) That the plaintiff's motion to compel filed November 16, 1992 and the motion to compel answers or motion to suppress filed November 30, 1992 be denied as moot. The motions, however, may be renewed;            (5) That the motion for protective order filed by ASU on December 7, 1992 be denied as moot; and            (6) That the motion to compel and motion for sanctions filed on December 14, 1992 be denied in part as follows: The motion insofar as it seeks to compel the deposition of Dr. Clarence Holloway is denied as moot.

A federal jury returned a verdict totaling more than $1 million Friday evening against Alabama State University.The jury found that the school had allowed an administrator to create a hostile work environment by racially and sexually harassing three female employees and that the women were retaliated against after they filed complaints.""Justice is served,"" said Cynthia Williams as she walked out of the courthouse about 6 p.m. Friday, alongside the two other plaintiffs, Jacqueline Weatherly and Lydia Burkhalter, who echoed the sentiment.The jury of four men and four women returned a verdict that includes compensation for emotional pain and mental anguish; back pay for Williams and Burkhalter, who were fired; and lost leave time for Weatherly.Kenneth Thomas, lead attorney for ASU in the case, said the defense team was disappointed but must accept the jury's decision.""(We are) just taking the jury verdict, reviewing and analyzing the university's options and (will be) discussing with appropriate university officials the next step to protect the university's interests,"" Thomas said without elaborating on what steps ASU might take.In a statement released Friday night, university spokesman Kenneth Mullinax indicated that ASU will consider appealing the verdict.The jury found that Lavonette Bartley, an ASU employee for about 27 years, created a racially hostile environment for all three women. She was accused of regularly using the N-word, calling one of the plaintiffs a ""white bitch"" and a number of other specific allegations. The jury also ruled in favor of Burkhalter's claim of sexual harassment.The plaintiffs, and Bartley, are black women with the exception of Burkhalter, who is described in court documents as biracial.Bartley was accused of making inappropriate comments about the then-24-year-old Burkhalter's body and clothes, suggesting Burkhalter strip to show how many tattoos she had and inappropriately brushing her body against Burkhalter in a narrow filing room.Bartley is the associate executive director in the office of Executive ASU Vice President and Chief Operating Officer John Knight. She works in Knight's office in Suite 119 of Council Hall on the ASU campus, where all three plaintiffs also have worked.The lawsuit also accused Knight of making romantic advances toward Burkhalter, although the verdict itself did not make it clear whether the jury's decision on sexual harassment included one or the other of those claims or both.The statement ASU released Friday night reads, in part:""Alabama State University maintains an equal opportunity environment committed to our founding principles of excellence and equality in higher education and has strong policies and procedures in place to prohibit discrimination and harassment of any individual. We will continue to ensure that all of our employees are guaranteed equal protection, not only to the letter of the law, but also to our higher expectations.""The trial lasted eight days and included testimony from some well-known elected officials, including Knight, a longtime state legislator.Also taking the stand were three members of the ASU board of trustees: Elton Dean, who is also chairman of the Montgomery County Commission; Marvin Wiggins, a Dallas County Circuit Court judge; and Herbert Young.The trustees all denied under oath that the plaintiffs had spoken to them about wanting transfers and about their issues with Bartley.The plaintiffs testified under oath that they had spoken with the trustees.Knight's testimony included denials of claims against him and that he had never heard Bartley use the N-word or other derogatory terms while on the ASU campus.The jury of four men and four women awarded Weatherly $350,000; Burkhalter $230,000; and Williams $213,500 for emotional pain and mental anguish.Jurors also awarded Williams $141,573.76 and Burkhalter $94,592.51 in back pay and Weatherly $9,453.06 in lost leave time.The jury deliberated for about 12 hours on the verdict, which included a number of specific charges. Toward the end of deliberations, jurors requested a calculator.

http://wfxl.com/news/local/albany-state-university-associate-professor-arrested-sexual-assault?id=350563,"Tue, 15 Sep 2009 21:43:07 GMT —   An Albany State University associate professor was arrested today and charged with sexual assault.      Dr. Philip Jemilohun, who has been an ASU faculty member since August 2007, is now on administrative leave without pay pending the criminal disposition.  The charges stem from two student complaints made with the ASU Police Department. The ASU Police Department launched an investigation and submitted its investigative report to the Dougherty County District Attorney's Office, which agreed that criminal charges should be sought.    ""When the students came forward with their complaints, we took them seriously,"" said ASU Police Chief Roberson Brown. ""The University will continue its own administrative investigation while the criminal charges are being pursued. In all situations, the safety of our students is always our top priority. If there are other students with similar complaints, they should contact ASU Police Department or the District Attorney's Office to file a complaint. We are committed to making sure that our students are protected,"" said Brown.  Jemilohun remains in the Dougherty County Jail tonight.  He is being held on $100,000 bond."

http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/investigations/2015/10/15/public-disservice-asu-discrimination-harassment-settlements/73852816/,"Nine settlements cost ASU $854,000 over five years, the second largest amount in the stateThe university paid two settlements after doctoral students said professors sexually harassed themThe two settlements involved the ASU’s criminology departmentMeaghan Paulhamus came to Arizona expecting to pursue her academic dream working for a top criminology scholar.Paulhamus, now in non-profit administration, was pursuing her doctoral degree in criminology at Northeastern University in Boston when her mentor, Robert Kane, told her he was leaving for Arizona State University.Eager to keep working with him, Paulhamus transferred to ASU where Kane would supervise and mentor her.But soon after she arrived in August 2008, she says Kane began making comments about her chest. Three months later, Kane allegedly walked out of a hotel bathroom at an out-of-town conference with his pants down.Paulhamus sued the Arizona Board of Regents, which oversees state universities. The board settled the case, with the state paying her a six-figure settlement while denying liability or wrongdoing.A high costPaulhamus’ case wasn’t an anomaly for Arizona or the university.The state paid $854,000 to settle nine lawsuits with ASU employees, mostly for racial and sexual discrimination from 2009 to 2014. The total payout was the second highest among state entities, and the number of cases was more than any other state agency.Paulhamus’ case is one of 57 claims by state workers — most alleging sexual, racial and age discrimination and harassment — investigated by The Arizona Republic. More than half the employees who filed claims said they were penalized by retaliation, while the accused went virtually unpunished — in many cases, they continued to garner pay raises and promotions.Phoenix civil-rights attorney Stephen Montoya said a $100,000 payout is a large settlement in an employment law case, and ASU had four that settled for that amount or more in the five-year span studied. If legal costs are included, that number rises to six.By comparison, eight settlements at the University of Arizona totaled $114,000, while three at Northern Arizona University cost $54,500. The UA’s largest settlement was $25,000, while NAU’s was $50,000. With 10,544 full-time equivalent employees, ASU actually has less than UA, which has 11,234. NAU has 3,199 full time equivalent employees. None of the figures include graduate student workers.Montoya said ASU’s record indicates a culture that allows bad behavior to go unpunished, with ASU administrators hoping it all “will go away.”ASU spokesman Mark Johnson would not speak to the particulars of any lawsuit, but suggested in a statement that it would be wrong to infer that the university has a problem with discrimination or harassment.“It is our hope that your story will reflect that in our legal system — nationally, not just in Arizona — claims are routinely settled for reasons other than whether the case has any merit,” Johnson said. “They often are resolved on the basis of cost; that fighting a claim would be more expensive than reaching a settlement.”Student harassedNeither Kane nor Paulhamus would discuss the case. The following account is from court records and ASU disciplinary records.Paulhamus claimed the harassment began with Kane’s comments about how well her clothing showed off her chest. He told Paulhamus he liked hearing rumors that they were sleeping together and he felt an amount of “ownership” of her.Throughout the late summer and fall of 2008, Kane told her he was “imagining” her in a swimsuit. In the fall, when Paulhamus e-mailed him saying she was concerned about inappropriate comments being made by fellow doctoral students, Kane e-mailed back: “I’m trying really hard (and failing) not to think about you in different sexual positions.”He sent her text messages and late-night e-mails, asking her what graduate students she would date. He said if he were a grad student, he would be very attracted to her, according to court records.In November 2008, when both traveled to a conference in St. Louis, Paulhamus purposely stayed at a different hotel. Kane repeatedly called her, sent her texts, asked to get drinks and insisted they prepare for a presentation in his hotel room.When Paulhamus got there, Kane went to change in the bathroom. He left the door open and then emerged with his pants down. He finished dressing in front of her, several times asking her opinion of the clothing he had selected to wear.Discrimination claims at ASU appear in varied formsAt the presentation, he rubbed his hand on her leg underneath the table. Later that night, Kane insisted that he buy her a drink and that she come to his hotel room. He sent her texts until 12:30 or 1 a.m., suggesting they meet at another hotel so that no one else could see them. When she declined, he said it was too bad because he wanted to kiss her goodnight.Paulhamus later met Kane at a coffee shop to tell him his behavior was inappropriate and that it had to stop. He excused it, saying he was drunk. And after that meeting, she said Kane retaliated against her, becoming much more critical and condescending toward her work.Paulhamus went to the university’s human-resources office and was directed to meet with Scott Decker, then-director of ASU’s School of Criminology and Criminal Justice.Decker, also named in the lawsuit, suggested Paulhamus change her course of study to a “more traditional” area for women. He also made comments suggesting he thought she and Kane had a consensual sexual relationship.Decker assigned her to a female professor who later released her as a teaching assistant. Unable to find a faculty mentor, and with Decker refusing to assign one to her, Paulhamus took medical leave from ASU and never returned.In 2011, she sued the Board of Regents, Kane and Decker, accusing them of sexual harassment and retaliation. In August 2011, she settled for $100,000. ASU spent another $31,000 to fight the case.Shortly after settling, ASU gave Kane a letter of admonishment.The letter said that “while some of the student’s allegations were unfounded,” Kane’s conduct violated university policies on nondiscrimination, anti-harassment, non-retaliation, sexual harassment and the university’s code of ethics. The letter said he showed a lack of professional judgment and called his conduct unacceptable. For the next year, he was was not allowed to make trips funded by the school, teach additional courses, or be assigned a student mentor or assistant. Kane left shortly thereafter.Kane now leads the Criminology and Justice Studies Program at Drexel University in Philadelphia. ASU hired him back as a senior consultant from January 2012 to August 2014, paying him $9,000 a year.Not the only caseDecker was named in a second lawsuit during the same period.Tasha Kunzi, a doctoral student, became romantically involved with professor Travis Pratt in 2009, according to court records. After Kunzi broke off the relationship in 2010, her lawsuit alleged, Pratt retaliated against her and threatened to ruin her career unless they got back together.Database of state discrimination settlementsCourt documents alleged other professors, including then-department chairman Decker, refused to do meaningful work with Kunzi. Decker assigned her to clerical work. Prior to that, she had been assigned research projects. Kunzi left in 2011. Pratt called her new employer “to reveal the details of Kunzi’s departure from ASU,” her lawsuit states.The lawsuit also alleged Pratt and Decker discriminated against Kunzi’s new husband by unfairly grading his doctoral examination in 2012.Kunzi settled for $44,000 in 2014. ASU spent roughly $104,000 in legal fees and associated costs. Pratt could not be reached for comment and did not respond to a letter hand-delivered to his home.Decker’s personnel record shows he never faced discipline at ASU. In 2015, he became the director of ASU’s new Center for Public Criminology.Decker said he could not comment on the cases because they involve legal matters, but noted he was dropped from the Kunzi lawsuit before it was settled.Pratt in 2012 was given a letter of admonishment, which reduced his salary by 10 percent, discontinued a $10,000 stipend and removed his title of “faculty exemplar.”His admonishment letter said Pratt assured the school’s dean there would be no repeat of his conduct. But at the time, Pratt already was involved in a relationship with another student, according to ASU disciplinary records.He was fired after that relationship was discovered in 2013. His conduct was partly responsible for the ASU faculty approving a more restrictive policy on faculty-student dating.Montoya, Kunzi’s lawyer, said ASU previously had a “laughable and ridiculous policy of permitting so-called amorous relationships. ... It’s almost always the student that is damaged.”He said filing a complaint is often academically destructive and emotionally embarrassing, and can spur retribution.“The cost of complaining is so profound,” Montoya said. “Oftentimes, it turns the entire department against you.”"
http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/barrett-the-honors-college-at-asu-is-a-close-knit-community-some-say-too-close-6633269,"
One morning last spring, Becca Smouse, a first-year student at Arizona State University's Barrett, The Honors College, jumped in her car and headed to Tempe for her intensive freshman seminar course, the Human Event.
The Human Event in many ways is the linchpin of Barrett's programming. It covers an ambitious topic -- the history of human ideas -- and is designed to challenge how students think through intensive reading, writing, and discussion.
Through the Human Event class and subsequent study-abroad trips, Barrett students begin to form the strong relationships with professors they will need as they move on to become teaching assistants and interns, to seek supervisors for their honors theses, and to apply for graduate school and jobs. The class is important, and so are the relationships it helps students to form.
But that March day, Smouse and her classmates found an unexpected note on their classroom door. It informed them that their professor, Dr. Joel Hunter, wouldn't make it in that day, or for the rest of the week. 
Smouse found the message odd, especially because Hunter usually was very communicative and it was unlike him to let students come all the way to campus just to find out that class was canceled. ""Why didn't he just e-mail us?"" she wondered.
Turns out, Dr. Hunter was never coming back.
A substitute arrived the next week, and students were told that Hunter wouldn't return that semester. Smouse says she and other students were worried about him at first.
Then, rumors began to swirl. Jokes about Hunter getting fired for sleeping with a student soon turned into campus-wide gossip.
But Barrett's administration remained silent. Smouse says she was disappointed in the lack of transparency, especially given the tight-knit nature of the school.
And she began to hear another rumor: This wasn't the first time something like this had happened at Barrett.
When an anonymously written blog post confirmed the gossip about Hunter, Smouse, a young journalist in training, responded the only way she knew how. She wrote about it, in an April 14 opinion piece for ASU's campus newspaper, The State Press.
""Unfortunately, the professor's controversial dismissal seems to have been left largely untouched by Barrett administration,"" she wrote. ""Rumors buzzing and parental concerns rising, the spotlight is shining brightly on the college's lack of acknowledgement. Many also see firing the professor as a cop-out, simply sweeping the problem under the rug of Barrett embarrassments. By cutting out the professor, it seems the college hoped to avoid confronting the situation all together.""
Turns out, sweeping Barrett's troubles under the rug hasn't been so easy.

One of Rebecca Smouse's Barrett classmates, Jane -- who asked to not be identified by her real name -- also was disappointed in the school's response.
But Jane wasn't just a student in Joel Hunter's class. She also was his lover.
In an April 10 blog post for a website called Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, Jane laid out details about her relationship with Hunter, the process of reporting him to the school, and his subsequent dismissal.
In the first 72 hours after her post was published, an attached petition calling on Barrett's dean to fire predatory professors collected more than 400 signatures.
""For the past 15 years, ASU's Barrett Honors College has been home to professors who sexually harass and sexually abuse students,"" the petition says. ""While romantic relationships between professors and students may seem consensual, the imbalance of power makes these relationships inherently coercive and abusive.""
Today, the petition has more than 1,000 signatures.
Jane's story is not unique.
In the past few years, Barrett has terminated the contracts of at least three professors who engaged in sexual relationships with students. Joel Hunter and Dr. Eric Susser were told their contracts were not being renewed after they admitted to violating ASU's student-professor relationship policies, and Dr. David Conz committed suicide after his contract was dropped when a student reported he'd given alcohol to the Barrett freshman he was dating. Police records, documents given to New Times by involved students, and reports by other media outlets confirm the terminations.
But some say the number of Barrett faculty members skirting the rules -- and whose contracts may have been dropped -- actually is far higher.
Barrett administrators aren't talking, but Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, replied on their behalf. ""Such relationships are inappropriate and do not comport with how we expect members of the faculty and lecturers to behave,"" Johnson says, ""and when such relationships are brought to our attention, appropriate steps are taken.""
In a three-month investigation of the issues at Barrett, New Times interviewed former and current Barrett students and staff and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal university documents, written student testimonials provided to the government in a formal complaint, and police reports.
ASU president Michael Crow did not respond to an interview request. Many of New Times' public records requests -- asking for everything from personnel files to police reports on these and other cases -- went largely ignored or unfilled. Much is still unknown.
But one thing is clear: Inappropriate student-professor relationships at Barrett have been a poorly kept secret for years.
ASU has, in fact, had its share of troubles when it comes to sex.
In May 2014, just a few weeks after Jane's blog post was published, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights made an unprecedented move: It announced the names of all schools being investigated for possible violations of Title IX, the federal legislation dictating how sexual violence and harassment complaints should be handled at schools that receive federal funding.
ASU was on the list of 55 schools. A Department of Education spokesman says the Office for Civil Rights is still investigating the university, but he did not provide further details.
For the most part, the problems at ASU have been linked to two worlds where these issues are better known: fraternities and athletics. ASU previously settled federal lawsuits dealing with the university's responses to two alleged sexual assaults, one involving a football player and the other a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
But a Title IX complaint filed in June 2014 by Jasmine Lester, a former Barrett student, asks the Office for Civil Rights to focus on a different sexual abuse problem on campus: that of professors sleeping with their undergraduate students.
At Barrett, and across all of ASU, professor-student relationships are banned in certain contexts, like when a student is currently in a professor's class or when a professor is supervising a student's thesis. But this policy still allows room for involvement between professors and students.
And particularly at Barrett, which educates more than 5,000 of ASU's nearly 60,000 undergraduates, there have been repeated issues with professors skirting -- sometimes, even defying -- the rules.
Prestigious universities across the nation have drawn much harder lines in regard to such relationships. In 2010, Yale University banned faculty members from forming relationships with any undergraduate students, noting in its updated policy that undergrads ""are particularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship."" In 2013, the University of Connecticut implemented a similar ban.
Last fall, ASU's faculty senate debated whether to replace its own policy with an outright ban on professor-undergraduate relationships.
At a senate meeting in November, Cynthia Tompkins, chair of the committee drafting the proposed policy changes, referenced the scope of ASU's problem. She said at least 20 faculty members across ASU have been dismissed for having inappropriate sexual relationships with students in recent years.
ASU hasn't provided the exact number of dismissals stemming from Barrett or elsewhere. ""We do not keep a running tally of faculty who are disciplined for [relationship policy] violations,"" a spokesman says. A representative from the university office charged with investigating these policy violations wouldn't comment on how many investigations she has conducted.
But when ASU was named on the list of schools under federal review, Michael Crow did speak to The State Press' editorial board, and he addressed the problem at Barrett.
Student journalist Nicholas Palomino Mendoza reported on May 7, 2014, that Crow said he was aware of ""reports of inappropriate sexual conduct between Barrett faculty and students.""
""If it's consensual in a sense of the way that the law looks at things,"" Mendoza quotes Crow as saying, ""then it is inappropriate from the perspective of how we expect our faculty members or our instructors to behave.""
""There have been professors in relationships with students, and when we find out about it, they are all fired,"" Crow told the paper.
The revisions to ASU's professor-undergraduate relationship policy would aim to switch the school's focus from reactive to proactive, and from firing violators to improving the culture around these relationships on the front end.
At the first reading of the proposed revisions in early October, Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, made clear what the policy changes would mean.
""To put it rather bluntly,"" she said, ""ASU students are not part of your dating pool.""

Barrett, the Honors College, is a school within a school.
Admissions documents say Barrett consists of ""living-learning communities"" of academically driven students from across ASU's four campuses. Barrett is where the cream of the ASU crop goes to be educated.
Barrett marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. The University Honors College was granted official status in 1988, when it became the first residential honors college in the nation. It was renamed for former Intel CEO Craig Barrett and his wife, Barbara, a former ambassador to Finland and Arizona gubernatorial candidate, after they endowed the school with a $10 million gift in 2000. The college has undergone great growth in recent years, with its current student body size rivaling its alumni population.
In its admissions literature, Barrett distinguishes itself from the wider university. Though the majority of ASU students were in the top 25 percent of their graduating high school classes, for example, most Barrett students were in the top 10 percent. One year, students donned T-shirts that read ""_arrett, the Honors College. We don't get B's.""
All of Barrett's honors faculty fellows hold Ph.D.s, and the school boasts a 15-to-1 student-faculty ratio, small in comparison to ASU's ratio of 22-to-1. Students, sometimes called ""The Commas"" in a reference to the school's stuffy title, almost universally refer to Barrett as tight-knit.
The college's largest campus is at the corner of Apache Boulevard and Rural Road in Tempe, neatly tucked behind a set of iron gates on ASU's central campus. The Barrett campus is fully enclosed, and were it not for some classes they take elsewhere, Barrett students practically could spend their college lives there. Students are, in fact, expected to live on campus for at least their first two years.
Barrett's central campus is reminiscent of the exclusive private schools Barrett emulates. It's got everything but the ivy and, indeed, references to the Ivy League (Harvard of the Southwest, anyone?) are not uncommon. Some students jokingly refer to the campus as ""The Nerd Cage.""
Outside, students gather in groups and study in solitude on the sandstone benches surrounding Barrett's green lawns. There's an outdoor fireplace for cold-weather gatherings and a volleyball pit.
Inside, Barrett's buildings serve multiple purposes, reflecting the insular nature of the Barrett community. One can find professors' offices, student dorms, and classrooms interspersed throughout any given structure.
In the Honors Hall -- in many ways, the hub of Barrett life -- there's a gym with flat-screen TVs and elliptical machines, a spiral staircase leading downstairs to a coffee shop, and a recreational area with ping-pong tables.
There's also the beautiful Refectory, or, as students call it in a reference to Harry Potter's Hogwarts, the Great Hall. On a Friday afternoon in December, one student casually played the grand piano as others sat at long tables with high-backed chairs and feasted in the hall's wood-paneled dining room.
In an adjacent hallway, photographs of Barrett students who went on to win prestigious fellowships line the walls: 185 Fulbright scholars, 52 Marshall scholars, 54 Goldwater scholars. The list goes on.
Barrett students major in any field they choose, taking classes in the disciplinary college of their choice. One student says there can be tension between Barrett and the rest of ASU, in part because of the special privileges afforded to Barrett students. Barrett students get to register for classes before others, for example, and sometimes are offered special courses the general ASU population can't take.
This includes the Human Event, a mandatory two-semester seminar taken during freshmen year.
Barrett freshmen may take a different professor for each semester of the intensive course, but they are encouraged to stick with one. They also are encouraged to participate in for-credit, study-abroad trips with their professors during the summer after the course finishes.
The Human Event is ""a wonderful course to get students into the idea of working closely with a professor,"" says a former staff member who asked to not be identified. But she says she also believes the class has contributed to the problem of too-close professor-student relations.
""Because it was so friendly,"" she says, ""if you had any faculty members who were not terribly ethical in how they related to youngsters, it was a situation in which they could take advantage.""
With these professors, sources tell New Times, office hours turn into intimate meetings. Examination of the ancient Greeks may have an odd focus on the sexual relationships between mentors and mentees. Trips abroad are fueled more by alcohol than by learning.
To many, Barrett's very structure, intended to create a close learning community for students and professors alike, has instead become something sinister: a way for predatory teachers to grow close to -- sometimes, even sexually -- the young and ambitious students in their tutelage.

Jane first was drawn to Barrett because of its strong sense of community. She enrolled in the school in 2012.
Her story unfolds in her blog post, interviews and e-mails with New Times, and a pile of documents she provided to the government in a Title IX complaint against ASU. The documents include Jane's personal e-mails and text messages as well as copies of e-mails she received from ASU detailing the investigation into and eventual dismissal of Dr. Joel Hunter.
Hunter, a Barrett faculty member since 2008, admitted to the university and to New Times that he violated ASU's professor-undergraduate relationships policy before his contract was dropped.
On his personal website, Hunter lists the many awards he won during his time at Barrett, including accolades for teaching excellence, academic service, and faculty mentoring.
Since he left the school, Hunter also has posted a lengthy student tutorial on how to succeed in Barrett's difficult freshmen seminar course. ""It is best to err on the side of formality,"" he wrote in a late September post focused on how to best communicate with one's Human Event professor. These professors are ""incredibly friendly and funny, yes,"" he writes, ""but they are not in your peer group.""
It seems hindsight is 20/20.
By the end of Jane's fall semester in Hunter's Human Event class, she and the professor had grown close.
In December 2012, Hunter e-mailed Jane, asking her to interrupt a meeting so it wouldn't drag on. ""Plus, I would get to see one of my favorite Human Event students twice in one day,"" he wrote.
Jane signed up to take Hunter's class again in the spring.
By January 2013, the two began getting together regularly for meetings and meals. Soon, they were texting, and by early February, their texts hinted at a sexual relationship.
Some texts reference a trip the two took to a local park, where Jane says Hunter provided her with alcohol and massaged her, suggesting that doing so would be easier if she didn't have clothes on. They spent the afternoon kissing.
A few weeks later, Hunter texted Jane about 2 a.m. from a Harry Potter conference he was attending in Albuquerque:
Joel: get your ass to albuquerque now dammit. I just closed down the hotel bar with a harry potter student of mine who will not, i'm sure of it, sleep with me. All alone am i . . .
Jane alleges that Hunter shared with her sexual fantasies about other Human Event students and said he'd fallen in love with a student before.
The two went on to have a covert sexual relationship -- aside from the clear violation of policy, Hunter was married with children -- having sex in cars, in Hunter's office, and in parking garages around campus. Jane says Hunter gave her extensions on schoolwork because of their relationship.
In their talks, interspersed with innuendo, was conversation about Jane's future.
Texts from the day after their trip to the park:
Jane: How is my letter of recommendation coming? :)
Joel: It'll be done this afternoon.
And an hour later:
Joel: Letter submitted electronically. They won't be able to give you the scholarship quickly enough . . .
Jane: You mean I don't get to read it? Noooooooooooooo
Joel: I'll share it with you later. It's totally hot.
Then, in April of Jane's freshman year, Barrett Professor David Conz committed suicide shortly after his teaching contract was dropped. Conz's dismissal was linked to a relationship with one of his Human Event students. Jane says Hunter made out Conz to be the victim of an unfair administration and began expressing fears about losing his own job.
A text conversation in the days that followed:
Jane: I know you didn't want a hug, but are you ok? I don't think I've ever seen you look so sad.
Joel: Im ok. Shook up, sad and feeling vulnerable. Life. 
In May 2013, Jane and Hunter had sexual intercourse in a motel.
The spring semester came to a close, and Jane fully expected that she and Hunter would resume their relationship when she returned for her sophomore year. The two even texted occasionally during the summer.
But when Jane returned to campus in August, she says, Hunter told her he'd learned that their affair was risky after a discussion at a Barrett faculty retreat. He abruptly broke off the relationship.
""One thing my professor said to me when he ended this affair still sticks out to me,"" Jane wrote in the closing of her Title IX complaint testimony. ""He had no idea that what he was doing was wrong or even against the rules, because it was so common for Barrett Honors College professors to be involved with students that all of the honors faculty saw it as normal.""
Hunter declined to be interviewed, and New Times isn't aware of what he is up to today. On his personal website, he says he is a married father of three.

On a Monday afternoon in early November, Arizona State University's faculty senate gathered to discuss, among other things, a motion to revise the Academic Affairs Manual (ACD) policy governing ""amorous relationships"" between professors and students. That policy, ACD 402, has been on the books since 1982.
In Tempe's Education Lecture Hall, a single observer watched from a seat toward the back. Jasmine Lester, a 2011 Barrett grad, is a small woman with curly brown hair. She wears glasses and looks younger than her 25 years.
Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, first laid out some ground rules. She asked senate members to refrain from dominating, and she made clear just who was invited to discuss this motion.
""Observers are welcome to observe as much as you want,"" she said. ""But be like children. You may be seen but not heard.""
For many years, ASU's amorous relationships guidelines fell under the university's sexual harassment policy. But in 2011, they were parsed to create a policy focused exclusively on consensual romantic or sexual student-professor relationships.
As written today, ACD 402 bans ASU employees from making key decisions -- grading, hiring, disciplining, or offering recommendations -- over anyone with whom they are in a sexual relationship. The policy bans faculty members from engaging in relationships with any students currently enrolled in their classes, and it says violations can result in disciplinary action up to termination.
But in 2014, the senate began considering revisions to ACD 402 that would give the policy much greater reach, banning all relationships between ASU faculty and undergraduate students.
If approved, the revisions would require faculty members to report any such relationships to a supervisor immediately, with policy exemptions made on a case-by-case basis.
""Our current policies regarding faculty-student relationships are inadequate as written,"" university spokesman Mark Johnson tells New Times. ""The faculty senate should be applauded for taking steps to strengthen those policies to ensure that faculty members and lecturers have only professional relationships with students.""
That November day, Cynthia Tompkins, who chaired the policy-revision task force, addressed the faculty senate. During the month-long comment period that preceded this meeting, she explained, many seemed to think the proposed revisions had come out of left field.
Tompkins acknowledged that professor-student relationships historically have had a wide range of acceptability -- you hear stories of professor-student couples that happily marry, she noted -- but she said many unacceptable versions have taken place at ASU in recent years.
In addition to the 20 firings mentioned above, Tompkins said, ASU has had at least one unwanted student-professor pregnancy this year.
The intent of the policy revisions, she said, is to put students back at the center of focus.
The floor was opened for discussion. Faculty members approached the microphone to raise questions and concerns.
Many were worried about the scope of the revised language. ASU is a big school. Would professors need to start IDing everyone they meet in Tempe?
The new language doesn't make clear just which relationships would be exempt. What about pre-existing ones? And what would happen if a professor reports a relationship and doesn't get an exemption?
""You really think about whether you want that relationship,"" Ossipov answered. ""One person would have to leave the university.""
Tensions rose.
""I want to be blunt. I think this policy is very invasive,"" a female faculty member said. ""Every amorous relationship is not a 40-year-old faculty member and an 18-year-old-student.""
Concerns were raised about privacy and the motion's intrusiveness and scope.
Finally, a frustrated female senator in the back of the auditorium walked up to the microphone and moved to vote down the controversial motion.
Twenty senators voted in favor of the policy revision. One abstained from voting.
And with 62 votes against the changes, the motion was -- for the time being, at least -- dead.
Ossipov said the motion would be returned to Tompkins' committee for further revisions. ""However, this will come back,"" she said. There was uncomfortable laughter.
On January 26, the senate will hold its next vote on the revisions.
As the faculty senator who effectively silenced the conversation made her way back to her seat, Jasmine Lester glared at her, her middle finger raised in the air. ""This is my whole life,"" Lester said. ""And she just shot it down.""

Jasmine Lester is an Arizona native with ASU roots. She grew up in Ahwatukee, the child of a mother who handles internship programming at the university and a father who is a professor and former dean of humanities in the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Lester's parents aren't affiliated directly with Barrett.
Lester enrolled in the honors college in 2007. Like Jane, she formed a close relationship with a professor, who hasn't returned New Times' request for comment.
New Times is limiting the details of Lester's story because of ongoing legal action.
In conversations with New Times and in her Title IX complaint, Lester says her relationship with the professor took on a dynamic that extended beyond professional boundaries.
In 2010, Lester went to ASU's Office of Equity and Inclusion to discuss the matter with Kamala Green, the office's executive director and ASU's Title IX compliance coordinator.
Green's responsibilities include investigating Title IX violations when a faculty or staff member is the accused.
But Lester says Green didn't see her situation as a violation. ""I was trying to tell her that this is how the power dynamic creates an inherently abusive dynamic or situation,"" Lester says, ""but she didn't understand that. She kept being like, 'You don't know what rape is.'""
Lester says she felt unheard -- silenced, even -- by the school.
A university spokesman says Lester's claims were investigated and that there was no finding of any policy violation on the part of the professor. Green cannot comment on individual cases, but says, ""ASU takes these cases very seriously, and we investigate every one of them as quickly as we possibly can.""
Lester never got the outcome she wanted from ASU, but she funneled her frustration into helping others.
In 2013 -- two years after she graduated -- Lester founded Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, an advocacy group focused on connecting ASU students with the national Title IX movement. Through that work, she began collecting stories of abuse, and by June 2014, she had enough information to file a formal Title IX complaint against ASU. Lester's complaint, which is still under investigation, will be incorporated into the ongoing federal investigation of ASU.
""I know how administrators maintain the status quo,"" Lester says. ""They wait for people to graduate. I didn't leave after I graduated. I stayed bugging them about it for the next three years.""
Lester's complaint focuses on several areas: sexual violence in Greek culture, a lack of resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students on campus, and the culture at Barrett.
The Barrett portion names names. It tells stories of alleged abuse by 11 Barrett professors, many still employees of the school.
Lester's complaint also details the school's response to Jane.
Jane was devastated when Hunter broke off their relationship. She continued to see him on campus, and she says she became depressed to the point of attempting suicide. As time passed -- and after she learned of Lester's work on campus -- Jane says her view of the relationship changed.
""He took advantage of his power over me to coerce me,"" Jane says in an e-mail. ""This wasn't a consensual relationship. It was sexual abuse and it was rape.""
In the testimony she provided for Lester's complaint, Jane says she felt trapped by the need to maintain Hunter as a reference, as well as fear that coming forward would mar her reputation, make her feel unsafe, and harm her relationships with other faculty. So she didn't say anything.
But in March 2014, she broke down and told two Barrett professors about the affair. Without warning her, they reported the situation to Barrett's dean of students. Jane was asked to come in -- against her will -- for a meeting.
In a process she calls ""organized intimidation,"" Jane says she told her story to Barrett's deans, to campus counseling and advocacy offices, and eventually to Kamala Green.
""I was put through the ringer, dragged across campus to people I didn't want to talk to, not provided any university support like a victim's advocate or anything, and victim-blamed either directly or indirectly at every single step,"" she says in an e-mail.
Days after Green and Jane's meeting, Hunter was sent a letter releasing him from all duties, effective immediately.
Barrett's deans called for a meeting of the faculty. A former staff member who wishes to remain unidentified says faculty were told that any additional complaint of abuse by a professor would lead to the dissolution of the signature Human Event course.
Because that seminar distinguishes Barrett from the rest of ASU, its dissolution could mean Barrett faculty no longer would be necessary.
In June, three months after she first filed her complaint, Jane received a final written decision from the university provost, based on the investigation conducted by Green's office. The investigation found that Joel Hunter violated ASU's policy on amorous relationships, as well as the university's code of ethics, by engaging in a sexual relationship with Jane while she was in his class.
Hunter declined to be interviewed, but he did send New Times a brief comment by e-mail.
Hunter confirmed that his contract was not renewed because he violated ACD 402.
But he still speaks highly of Barrett. ""My experience was that it is a great culture with caring, supportive deans and staff, a stellar faculty who are committed to teaching excellence, and the brightest students I've ever had the pleasure to teach,"" he wrote.
Jane currently is a junior at the honors college. ""For the most part, I avoid Barrett,"" she says. ""I just go to classes, and I live off campus now, so it's not as bad. But the thing at Barrett is you always run into people you are trying to avoid. It's this wonderful honors community, where the deans and professors are always out socializing with the students,"" she says with obvious sarcasm.
""There are individually decent people in the administration,"" Jane notes. ""The problem is they can't change anything. There's nothing they can do as individuals to change the overwhelming institutional problems of rape culture and prioritizing the school's reputation over supporting victims.""
The very community that drew Jane to Barrett now is a disappointment to her. She points to the deans' treatment of her; the school's reporting process, which she says was marred by poor communication and missed deadlines; the faculty and staff who have ignored this problem for years; and the students who looked for reasons to blame her.
""They should really be ashamed of themselves,"" she says.

Dr. Eric Susser, an award-winning Barrett professor -- he was both the first non tenure-track recipient of the prestigious Founder's Day Faculty Achievement Award in Teaching and voted ""Hottest Professor"" in The State Press' annual poll on more than one occasion -- also had his contract dropped because of ACD 402 violations.
(New Times Managing Editor Amy Silverman and Susser's ex-wife, Deborah Sussman, have co-taught a local writing workshop for more than a decade.)
On www.ratemyprofessors.com, a national website on which students post anonymous professor reviews, comments show how the intimacy and intensity of the Human Event course can sometimes shift the tone of student-professor relationships down an inappropriate path.
Susser received the following comments from students in his class:
• 9/18/2005: ""Susser understands how to relate to college students. He's very entertaining and engaging. He's incredibly smart and the class is very thought-provoking . . . I loved this class. Plus I sort of had a crush on him.""
• 7/20/2010: ""Dr. Susser is wonderful! Not only did he take a special interest in me, he sought out students who needed extra help & made time for all of us to meet with him 1:1. If you need coaching for your writing or classroom participation, he's the guy to go to. But he's also full of himself. Don't let on that you think he's hot. Play it cool you'll be OK.""
Susser, who taught at Barrett for 15 years, developed and led the college's wildly popular trips to Paris. Like all Barrett professors, Susser pushed his Human Event students to join.
Rumors about inappropriate happenings on those trips swirled for years. A former Barrett staff member who wishes to remain anonymous says she heard students saying they wanted to go on the Paris trip specifically in hopes of sleeping with Susser.
The Paris trips eventually came to a stop, right around the time Susser left the school.
ASU hasn't fulfilled New Times' requests for copies of personnel files, including those of Susser, but Fox 10 News did obtain the records for a September 17 report.
According to documents shown in Fox 10's newscast, Susser's contract was not renewed in 2012 after he admitted to having sexual relationships with three Barrett students.
Susser, who divorced in 2005 and remarried in 2012, hasn't returned multiple requests for comment.
ASU did provide New Times with a July 2012 letter in which Barrett Dean Mark Jacobs notified Susser that he would not receive an annual academic year appointment.
Instead, Susser was offered a ""limited appointment"" for the fall semester only. He was told he would work on curriculum development, as a telecommuter, until his final date of employment on December 21 of that year. He no longer would have office space at Barrett -- he was given two weeks to clear out his personal belongings -- and he was told he no longer would teach or supervise student projects.
The letter doesn't detail why Susser's relationship with the school changed.
Though the university wouldn't share more detailed records with New Times, ASU Police Department records do describe the former professor's behavior.
According to one ASU police report, on the morning of March 31, 2014 -- 15 months after Susser's contract ended -- a staff member at the university's largest library, Hayden, found a brown bag that had been left behind on the second floor.
Inside, she located an ASU identification card with Eric Susser's name on it. She tried to e-mail Susser about the bag, but the e-mail -- likely because Susser no longer was employed by ASU -- didn't transmit.
The staff member continued to look and found more than she expected in the backpack. She contacted ASU's police.
Police listed the impounded bag's contents in their report. In addition to two ASU identification cards, a bill, and a MasterCard all bearing Susser's name, police found ""2 lancets, 3 meth pipes (one with residue), two pill containers (one possibly containing crystal meth), a bag of empty pill capsules, and a prescription bottle made out to Susser which contained various tablets.""
The tablets: ""oxycodone, amphetamine, Viagra,"" and more.
Police initially were unable to contact Susser -- his driver's license was suspended, they wrote in the report -- so the case was marked as pending. Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, says Susser recently was served with a no-trespass order barring him from campus.
But this wasn't Susser's first incident at ASU's libraries, or the ASU Police Department's first hint that the professor might be troubled.
Susser once was the subject of a handwritten field interrogation card, also drafted by ASU's police force. That 2002 document details some of the professor's other alleged extracurricular pursuits.
""Susser was contacted after a 101"" -- in police code, a 101 is a woman in a car -- ""said he exposed himself on the third floor of law library,"" police wrote.
The officer noted that a subject matching Susser's description was involved in a similar incident, in the same location, just two days before.
According to the report, Susser admitted to the officer that he was ""checking out women,"" but he denied having exposed himself.
The officer who wrote the report tells New Times he has no specific recollection of the incident.
But at the time, he clearly knew who Susser was. He listed Susser's ASU affiliation as ""faculty,"" and under employer, he wrote: ""ASU (Honors College).""
Just what happened after ASU police learned that the professor allegedly had flashed students is unclear.
The ASU Police Department says it no longer can find a copy of this document in its files. Kamala Green wasn't aware of the incident, though she wasn't in office at the time, and Mark Johnson, the university spokesman, hasn't provided specific comment on this report. For now, the trail ends at the ASU Police Department, which hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment.
Johnson says he doesn't know whether police notified Barrett or ASU administrators of the incident. ""Under current police department practice, the department would notify senior administrators and the relevant department,"" he says. ""I can't speak to what the practice may have been under the previous police administration.""
But one thing is clear: Susser kept his job for another decade after this report.
It's unknown whether Susser has found employment as a university professor, but he apparently has kept busy since leaving ASU. In June 2014, the Cooking Channel aired an episode of its show Belly Up! -- a kind of Bar Rescue rip-off -- titled ""Hidden Issues."" The episode focused on Susser's latest endeavor: a bar in West Phoenix called The Hideaway West Bar and Grill.
A student commenter on www.ratemyprofessors.com wrote of Susser in 2008: ""Susser is amazing because he lets the discussions go where they will and interjects when he has something important to say. Very intelligent professor, although a little slimy as a person.""

The problem at Barrett admittedly is complex.
Even 18-year-old freshmen are adults capable of giving consent under the law.
But experts tend to agree that stricter policies, such as the one ASU is considering, make more sense. Doctors can't sleep with patients and lawyers can't sleep with clients, so why should professors be able to sleep with their students?
Dr. Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, an expert on young adults, author of Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, says his research supports ""a taboo"" on all faculty-undergraduate relationships.
""It's almost inevitably exploitative,"" he says, ""even if neither side thinks of it that way.""
Arnett coined the term ""emerging adulthood"" to describe the time from 18 to 25 before people take on the full set of adult responsibilities, like career, marriage, and family. His research on emerging adults in many ways reflects common sense: People between these ages look and can act like grownups, but they just aren't equipped to make the greatest decisions.
""People's decision-making abilities are not as developed at 19 or 20 as they will be at 40 or 50,"" Arnett says. ""Do you really want to be 19 and in a class with a professor you like, and your roommate's dating him? That is weird by any standard, and it's disruptive to the central mission of the university, which is to teach young people, to prepare them for adult life.""
Seth Schwartz, a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and the incoming president of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, similarly is concerned.
""It's sort of hard to say no,"" Schwartz says. ""That's the major problem with these relationships between students and faculty: Are you willing to say no to someone who is in a position of authority over you?""

Dr. David Bruce Conz died with his pants around his ankles.
Conz, 39, was open with the university about a relationship he'd formed with a former student. But his tale took a tragic turn.
His autopsy report lays out what happened:
""Cause of death: gunshot wound to head and brain.""
""Manner: suicide.""
Under ""Diagnoses and Significant Findings,"" the medical examiner lists ""history of depression over work situation.""
Friends and family didn't see it coming.
Conz was a two-time ASU alum, and he began teaching at the school in 2005. A dedicated home brewer, Conz was nicknamed ""Professor Beer"" and led a popular ASU course in which students developed their own concoctions.
Conz formed a relationship with a Barrett freshman who recently had completed his Human Event course. Soon after, he shot himself in the mouth.
Rebekah Hollenberg was Conz's long-term girlfriend. The two met while swing dancing downtown, and they had been together for two and a half years at the time of his death.
""He studied do-it-yourself things, and he would make his own biodiesel and raise his own chickens,"" Hollenberg says. ""He was brilliant in so many ways.""
Conz and Hollenberg were polyamorous -- they were open with each other about dating other people -- and in late December 2012, Conz told Hollenberg that he was seeing a former student.
""The type of relationship we had is sort of unconventional and hard for people to understand,"" Hollenberg says. ""I was supportive of [the student] and Dave's relationship. I made them dinner. I gave them gifts. I wanted to make them happy.""
The former student asks not to be identified and declined to be interviewed for this story, but much of her tale is revealed in a detailed police report on Conz's death.
Around February 2013, Conz told Hollenberg he was called into a meeting at Barrett to discuss the relationship, ""a kind of review to see that everything was above board,"" she says.
Conz told Hollenberg that they were given the all-clear. The student no longer was in his class, so the relationship wasn't in violation of ASU policy.
Regardless, Conz began worrying about his job security after the meeting. He was scheduled for a formal contract renewal review later in the spring, and because Barrett doesn't offer its professors tenure, the meetings always made him nervous.
And then, the police report says, Conz accidentally received an e-mail that was about him but not for him, one that referenced an upcoming meeting of the deans to discuss his relationship with the student.
At his April 3 review, Conz was told that his contract wouldn't be renewed.
""It was just a shock for him,"" Hollenberg says. ""They told him that it was okay.""
The student later would tell police that Conz was terminated after it was reported to a Barrett dean that he had given her alcohol. Under state law and current ASU policy, it's more problematic for a professor to hand an underage student a beer than it is for him to sleep with her.
After his firing, Conz spiraled. ""He was kind of acting like his life was over,"" Hollenberg says. ""That was his identity, and it was sort of just taken so suddenly.""
She says she and Conz discussed their options -- moving to Vancouver, working full-time on DIY projects -- ""but he just wasn't able to get that vision yet,"" she says. ""And he was worried that if they put something in his record that seemed derogatory, he would never get another professorship anyway.""
Conz began drinking heavily.
Five days after he was fired, on April 8, 2013, Hollenberg became worried when Conz didn't pick her up for a date they had planned. She called him, and he sounded drunk. So she went to his house.
Meanwhile, the student told police that she had arrived at Conz's house about 5 that evening. She found him in bed, drunk, next to two bottles of Black Velvet Whisky -- one empty, the other half full -- and a loaded .38-caliber revolver at his side.
The student hid the revolver in a closet and called Conz's ex-wife, a psychiatrist. While they were on the phone, Conz ran from the house.
Hollenberg arrived about 5:30 and met Conz and the student in the driveway, where the student told her what was happening.
At 5:59, the student called police, who told her to keep Conz out of the house, away from the guns. When Conz tried to go inside, she tackled him.
Hollenberg told police that a full-fledged fight ensued, with the student and her former professor punching and kicking each other. She says Conz called the student ""cunt,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole.""
The student told police that Conz told her ""it was her fault, that she got him fired.""
Finally, Conz broke free, yelling at the student: ""You caused this.""
He ran into the house and locked the women out. They got inside using a spare key, and almost immediately they heard gunshots coming from the locked hallway bathroom. The first shot blasted through the door, passing just above the student's head. Seven seconds later, a second shot entered Conz's mouth.
Police found Conz seated on the toilet, his pants pulled down. The bathroom floor and wall were splattered with blood, and a silver revolver was on the floor. A bullet had exited through the top of Conz's skull.
Conz was conscious on the way to the hospital -- he admitted to paramedics that he'd shot himself -- but he was listed in critical condition upon arrival.
Hollenberg visited Conz frequently. Though he was unconscious, she sang to him, read to him, and talked to him.
Conz's mother removed him from life support on April 12, and he died later that day.
Months after his death, Conz's mother gave police a note she found on a torn piece of paper in his home. It's not clear who it was intended for, but police found the note significant enough to include in their report.
""Your love blossoms within me,"" Conz wrote. ""Like a parasite to liberate or embrace you I must die.""
Throughout his autopsy and the lengthy police report, Conz's job loss -- consistently tied to his relationship with the student -- is named as a key contributing factor in his suicide. In the course of their investigation, police even interviewed Frederick Corey, the dean who had let Conz go. Corey did not return requests for comment on Conz's case.
The student later provided testimony for Jasmine Lester's Title IX complaint. In it, she says she saw her relationship with Conz as above board. She'd even introduced him to her parents.
""The relationship was highly pleasurable and showed no outward signs of abuse besides the innate power imbalance that resides within a 20-year age gap,"" she wrote.
""He was loved by many, and still is.""
The student took off three semesters after Conz's death. She no longer speaks to Hollenberg, who moved to Illinois.
Never in her testimony does the student say she regrets dating Conz. Instead, she takes aim at ASU's rules on such relationships.
""We continued the relationship,"" she writes, ""because we realized ASU had no policy regarding faculty-student relationships as long as the student is no longer in the professor's class.""

"
http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/barrett-the-honors-college-at-asu-is-a-close-knit-community-some-say-too-close-6633269,"
One morning last spring, Becca Smouse, a first-year student at Arizona State University's Barrett, The Honors College, jumped in her car and headed to Tempe for her intensive freshman seminar course, the Human Event.
The Human Event in many ways is the linchpin of Barrett's programming. It covers an ambitious topic -- the history of human ideas -- and is designed to challenge how students think through intensive reading, writing, and discussion.
Through the Human Event class and subsequent study-abroad trips, Barrett students begin to form the strong relationships with professors they will need as they move on to become teaching assistants and interns, to seek supervisors for their honors theses, and to apply for graduate school and jobs. The class is important, and so are the relationships it helps students to form.
But that March day, Smouse and her classmates found an unexpected note on their classroom door. It informed them that their professor, Dr. Joel Hunter, wouldn't make it in that day, or for the rest of the week. 
Smouse found the message odd, especially because Hunter usually was very communicative and it was unlike him to let students come all the way to campus just to find out that class was canceled. ""Why didn't he just e-mail us?"" she wondered.
Turns out, Dr. Hunter was never coming back.
A substitute arrived the next week, and students were told that Hunter wouldn't return that semester. Smouse says she and other students were worried about him at first.
Then, rumors began to swirl. Jokes about Hunter getting fired for sleeping with a student soon turned into campus-wide gossip.
But Barrett's administration remained silent. Smouse says she was disappointed in the lack of transparency, especially given the tight-knit nature of the school.
And she began to hear another rumor: This wasn't the first time something like this had happened at Barrett.
When an anonymously written blog post confirmed the gossip about Hunter, Smouse, a young journalist in training, responded the only way she knew how. She wrote about it, in an April 14 opinion piece for ASU's campus newspaper, The State Press.
""Unfortunately, the professor's controversial dismissal seems to have been left largely untouched by Barrett administration,"" she wrote. ""Rumors buzzing and parental concerns rising, the spotlight is shining brightly on the college's lack of acknowledgement. Many also see firing the professor as a cop-out, simply sweeping the problem under the rug of Barrett embarrassments. By cutting out the professor, it seems the college hoped to avoid confronting the situation all together.""
Turns out, sweeping Barrett's troubles under the rug hasn't been so easy.

One of Rebecca Smouse's Barrett classmates, Jane -- who asked to not be identified by her real name -- also was disappointed in the school's response.
But Jane wasn't just a student in Joel Hunter's class. She also was his lover.
In an April 10 blog post for a website called Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, Jane laid out details about her relationship with Hunter, the process of reporting him to the school, and his subsequent dismissal.
In the first 72 hours after her post was published, an attached petition calling on Barrett's dean to fire predatory professors collected more than 400 signatures.
""For the past 15 years, ASU's Barrett Honors College has been home to professors who sexually harass and sexually abuse students,"" the petition says. ""While romantic relationships between professors and students may seem consensual, the imbalance of power makes these relationships inherently coercive and abusive.""
Today, the petition has more than 1,000 signatures.
Jane's story is not unique.
In the past few years, Barrett has terminated the contracts of at least three professors who engaged in sexual relationships with students. Joel Hunter and Dr. Eric Susser were told their contracts were not being renewed after they admitted to violating ASU's student-professor relationship policies, and Dr. David Conz committed suicide after his contract was dropped when a student reported he'd given alcohol to the Barrett freshman he was dating. Police records, documents given to New Times by involved students, and reports by other media outlets confirm the terminations.
But some say the number of Barrett faculty members skirting the rules -- and whose contracts may have been dropped -- actually is far higher.
Barrett administrators aren't talking, but Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, replied on their behalf. ""Such relationships are inappropriate and do not comport with how we expect members of the faculty and lecturers to behave,"" Johnson says, ""and when such relationships are brought to our attention, appropriate steps are taken.""
In a three-month investigation of the issues at Barrett, New Times interviewed former and current Barrett students and staff and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal university documents, written student testimonials provided to the government in a formal complaint, and police reports.
ASU president Michael Crow did not respond to an interview request. Many of New Times' public records requests -- asking for everything from personnel files to police reports on these and other cases -- went largely ignored or unfilled. Much is still unknown.
But one thing is clear: Inappropriate student-professor relationships at Barrett have been a poorly kept secret for years.
ASU has, in fact, had its share of troubles when it comes to sex.
In May 2014, just a few weeks after Jane's blog post was published, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights made an unprecedented move: It announced the names of all schools being investigated for possible violations of Title IX, the federal legislation dictating how sexual violence and harassment complaints should be handled at schools that receive federal funding.
ASU was on the list of 55 schools. A Department of Education spokesman says the Office for Civil Rights is still investigating the university, but he did not provide further details.
For the most part, the problems at ASU have been linked to two worlds where these issues are better known: fraternities and athletics. ASU previously settled federal lawsuits dealing with the university's responses to two alleged sexual assaults, one involving a football player and the other a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
But a Title IX complaint filed in June 2014 by Jasmine Lester, a former Barrett student, asks the Office for Civil Rights to focus on a different sexual abuse problem on campus: that of professors sleeping with their undergraduate students.
At Barrett, and across all of ASU, professor-student relationships are banned in certain contexts, like when a student is currently in a professor's class or when a professor is supervising a student's thesis. But this policy still allows room for involvement between professors and students.
And particularly at Barrett, which educates more than 5,000 of ASU's nearly 60,000 undergraduates, there have been repeated issues with professors skirting -- sometimes, even defying -- the rules.
Prestigious universities across the nation have drawn much harder lines in regard to such relationships. In 2010, Yale University banned faculty members from forming relationships with any undergraduate students, noting in its updated policy that undergrads ""are particularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship."" In 2013, the University of Connecticut implemented a similar ban.
Last fall, ASU's faculty senate debated whether to replace its own policy with an outright ban on professor-undergraduate relationships.
At a senate meeting in November, Cynthia Tompkins, chair of the committee drafting the proposed policy changes, referenced the scope of ASU's problem. She said at least 20 faculty members across ASU have been dismissed for having inappropriate sexual relationships with students in recent years.
ASU hasn't provided the exact number of dismissals stemming from Barrett or elsewhere. ""We do not keep a running tally of faculty who are disciplined for [relationship policy] violations,"" a spokesman says. A representative from the university office charged with investigating these policy violations wouldn't comment on how many investigations she has conducted.
But when ASU was named on the list of schools under federal review, Michael Crow did speak to The State Press' editorial board, and he addressed the problem at Barrett.
Student journalist Nicholas Palomino Mendoza reported on May 7, 2014, that Crow said he was aware of ""reports of inappropriate sexual conduct between Barrett faculty and students.""
""If it's consensual in a sense of the way that the law looks at things,"" Mendoza quotes Crow as saying, ""then it is inappropriate from the perspective of how we expect our faculty members or our instructors to behave.""
""There have been professors in relationships with students, and when we find out about it, they are all fired,"" Crow told the paper.
The revisions to ASU's professor-undergraduate relationship policy would aim to switch the school's focus from reactive to proactive, and from firing violators to improving the culture around these relationships on the front end.
At the first reading of the proposed revisions in early October, Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, made clear what the policy changes would mean.
""To put it rather bluntly,"" she said, ""ASU students are not part of your dating pool.""

Barrett, the Honors College, is a school within a school.
Admissions documents say Barrett consists of ""living-learning communities"" of academically driven students from across ASU's four campuses. Barrett is where the cream of the ASU crop goes to be educated.
Barrett marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. The University Honors College was granted official status in 1988, when it became the first residential honors college in the nation. It was renamed for former Intel CEO Craig Barrett and his wife, Barbara, a former ambassador to Finland and Arizona gubernatorial candidate, after they endowed the school with a $10 million gift in 2000. The college has undergone great growth in recent years, with its current student body size rivaling its alumni population.
In its admissions literature, Barrett distinguishes itself from the wider university. Though the majority of ASU students were in the top 25 percent of their graduating high school classes, for example, most Barrett students were in the top 10 percent. One year, students donned T-shirts that read ""_arrett, the Honors College. We don't get B's.""
All of Barrett's honors faculty fellows hold Ph.D.s, and the school boasts a 15-to-1 student-faculty ratio, small in comparison to ASU's ratio of 22-to-1. Students, sometimes called ""The Commas"" in a reference to the school's stuffy title, almost universally refer to Barrett as tight-knit.
The college's largest campus is at the corner of Apache Boulevard and Rural Road in Tempe, neatly tucked behind a set of iron gates on ASU's central campus. The Barrett campus is fully enclosed, and were it not for some classes they take elsewhere, Barrett students practically could spend their college lives there. Students are, in fact, expected to live on campus for at least their first two years.
Barrett's central campus is reminiscent of the exclusive private schools Barrett emulates. It's got everything but the ivy and, indeed, references to the Ivy League (Harvard of the Southwest, anyone?) are not uncommon. Some students jokingly refer to the campus as ""The Nerd Cage.""
Outside, students gather in groups and study in solitude on the sandstone benches surrounding Barrett's green lawns. There's an outdoor fireplace for cold-weather gatherings and a volleyball pit.
Inside, Barrett's buildings serve multiple purposes, reflecting the insular nature of the Barrett community. One can find professors' offices, student dorms, and classrooms interspersed throughout any given structure.
In the Honors Hall -- in many ways, the hub of Barrett life -- there's a gym with flat-screen TVs and elliptical machines, a spiral staircase leading downstairs to a coffee shop, and a recreational area with ping-pong tables.
There's also the beautiful Refectory, or, as students call it in a reference to Harry Potter's Hogwarts, the Great Hall. On a Friday afternoon in December, one student casually played the grand piano as others sat at long tables with high-backed chairs and feasted in the hall's wood-paneled dining room.
In an adjacent hallway, photographs of Barrett students who went on to win prestigious fellowships line the walls: 185 Fulbright scholars, 52 Marshall scholars, 54 Goldwater scholars. The list goes on.
Barrett students major in any field they choose, taking classes in the disciplinary college of their choice. One student says there can be tension between Barrett and the rest of ASU, in part because of the special privileges afforded to Barrett students. Barrett students get to register for classes before others, for example, and sometimes are offered special courses the general ASU population can't take.
This includes the Human Event, a mandatory two-semester seminar taken during freshmen year.
Barrett freshmen may take a different professor for each semester of the intensive course, but they are encouraged to stick with one. They also are encouraged to participate in for-credit, study-abroad trips with their professors during the summer after the course finishes.
The Human Event is ""a wonderful course to get students into the idea of working closely with a professor,"" says a former staff member who asked to not be identified. But she says she also believes the class has contributed to the problem of too-close professor-student relations.
""Because it was so friendly,"" she says, ""if you had any faculty members who were not terribly ethical in how they related to youngsters, it was a situation in which they could take advantage.""
With these professors, sources tell New Times, office hours turn into intimate meetings. Examination of the ancient Greeks may have an odd focus on the sexual relationships between mentors and mentees. Trips abroad are fueled more by alcohol than by learning.
To many, Barrett's very structure, intended to create a close learning community for students and professors alike, has instead become something sinister: a way for predatory teachers to grow close to -- sometimes, even sexually -- the young and ambitious students in their tutelage.

Jane first was drawn to Barrett because of its strong sense of community. She enrolled in the school in 2012.
Her story unfolds in her blog post, interviews and e-mails with New Times, and a pile of documents she provided to the government in a Title IX complaint against ASU. The documents include Jane's personal e-mails and text messages as well as copies of e-mails she received from ASU detailing the investigation into and eventual dismissal of Dr. Joel Hunter.
Hunter, a Barrett faculty member since 2008, admitted to the university and to New Times that he violated ASU's professor-undergraduate relationships policy before his contract was dropped.
On his personal website, Hunter lists the many awards he won during his time at Barrett, including accolades for teaching excellence, academic service, and faculty mentoring.
Since he left the school, Hunter also has posted a lengthy student tutorial on how to succeed in Barrett's difficult freshmen seminar course. ""It is best to err on the side of formality,"" he wrote in a late September post focused on how to best communicate with one's Human Event professor. These professors are ""incredibly friendly and funny, yes,"" he writes, ""but they are not in your peer group.""
It seems hindsight is 20/20.
By the end of Jane's fall semester in Hunter's Human Event class, she and the professor had grown close.
In December 2012, Hunter e-mailed Jane, asking her to interrupt a meeting so it wouldn't drag on. ""Plus, I would get to see one of my favorite Human Event students twice in one day,"" he wrote.
Jane signed up to take Hunter's class again in the spring.
By January 2013, the two began getting together regularly for meetings and meals. Soon, they were texting, and by early February, their texts hinted at a sexual relationship.
Some texts reference a trip the two took to a local park, where Jane says Hunter provided her with alcohol and massaged her, suggesting that doing so would be easier if she didn't have clothes on. They spent the afternoon kissing.
A few weeks later, Hunter texted Jane about 2 a.m. from a Harry Potter conference he was attending in Albuquerque:
Joel: get your ass to albuquerque now dammit. I just closed down the hotel bar with a harry potter student of mine who will not, i'm sure of it, sleep with me. All alone am i . . .
Jane alleges that Hunter shared with her sexual fantasies about other Human Event students and said he'd fallen in love with a student before.
The two went on to have a covert sexual relationship -- aside from the clear violation of policy, Hunter was married with children -- having sex in cars, in Hunter's office, and in parking garages around campus. Jane says Hunter gave her extensions on schoolwork because of their relationship.
In their talks, interspersed with innuendo, was conversation about Jane's future.
Texts from the day after their trip to the park:
Jane: How is my letter of recommendation coming? :)
Joel: It'll be done this afternoon.
And an hour later:
Joel: Letter submitted electronically. They won't be able to give you the scholarship quickly enough . . .
Jane: You mean I don't get to read it? Noooooooooooooo
Joel: I'll share it with you later. It's totally hot.
Then, in April of Jane's freshman year, Barrett Professor David Conz committed suicide shortly after his teaching contract was dropped. Conz's dismissal was linked to a relationship with one of his Human Event students. Jane says Hunter made out Conz to be the victim of an unfair administration and began expressing fears about losing his own job.
A text conversation in the days that followed:
Jane: I know you didn't want a hug, but are you ok? I don't think I've ever seen you look so sad.
Joel: Im ok. Shook up, sad and feeling vulnerable. Life. 
In May 2013, Jane and Hunter had sexual intercourse in a motel.
The spring semester came to a close, and Jane fully expected that she and Hunter would resume their relationship when she returned for her sophomore year. The two even texted occasionally during the summer.
But when Jane returned to campus in August, she says, Hunter told her he'd learned that their affair was risky after a discussion at a Barrett faculty retreat. He abruptly broke off the relationship.
""One thing my professor said to me when he ended this affair still sticks out to me,"" Jane wrote in the closing of her Title IX complaint testimony. ""He had no idea that what he was doing was wrong or even against the rules, because it was so common for Barrett Honors College professors to be involved with students that all of the honors faculty saw it as normal.""
Hunter declined to be interviewed, and New Times isn't aware of what he is up to today. On his personal website, he says he is a married father of three.

On a Monday afternoon in early November, Arizona State University's faculty senate gathered to discuss, among other things, a motion to revise the Academic Affairs Manual (ACD) policy governing ""amorous relationships"" between professors and students. That policy, ACD 402, has been on the books since 1982.
In Tempe's Education Lecture Hall, a single observer watched from a seat toward the back. Jasmine Lester, a 2011 Barrett grad, is a small woman with curly brown hair. She wears glasses and looks younger than her 25 years.
Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, first laid out some ground rules. She asked senate members to refrain from dominating, and she made clear just who was invited to discuss this motion.
""Observers are welcome to observe as much as you want,"" she said. ""But be like children. You may be seen but not heard.""
For many years, ASU's amorous relationships guidelines fell under the university's sexual harassment policy. But in 2011, they were parsed to create a policy focused exclusively on consensual romantic or sexual student-professor relationships.
As written today, ACD 402 bans ASU employees from making key decisions -- grading, hiring, disciplining, or offering recommendations -- over anyone with whom they are in a sexual relationship. The policy bans faculty members from engaging in relationships with any students currently enrolled in their classes, and it says violations can result in disciplinary action up to termination.
But in 2014, the senate began considering revisions to ACD 402 that would give the policy much greater reach, banning all relationships between ASU faculty and undergraduate students.
If approved, the revisions would require faculty members to report any such relationships to a supervisor immediately, with policy exemptions made on a case-by-case basis.
""Our current policies regarding faculty-student relationships are inadequate as written,"" university spokesman Mark Johnson tells New Times. ""The faculty senate should be applauded for taking steps to strengthen those policies to ensure that faculty members and lecturers have only professional relationships with students.""
That November day, Cynthia Tompkins, who chaired the policy-revision task force, addressed the faculty senate. During the month-long comment period that preceded this meeting, she explained, many seemed to think the proposed revisions had come out of left field.
Tompkins acknowledged that professor-student relationships historically have had a wide range of acceptability -- you hear stories of professor-student couples that happily marry, she noted -- but she said many unacceptable versions have taken place at ASU in recent years.
In addition to the 20 firings mentioned above, Tompkins said, ASU has had at least one unwanted student-professor pregnancy this year.
The intent of the policy revisions, she said, is to put students back at the center of focus.
The floor was opened for discussion. Faculty members approached the microphone to raise questions and concerns.
Many were worried about the scope of the revised language. ASU is a big school. Would professors need to start IDing everyone they meet in Tempe?
The new language doesn't make clear just which relationships would be exempt. What about pre-existing ones? And what would happen if a professor reports a relationship and doesn't get an exemption?
""You really think about whether you want that relationship,"" Ossipov answered. ""One person would have to leave the university.""
Tensions rose.
""I want to be blunt. I think this policy is very invasive,"" a female faculty member said. ""Every amorous relationship is not a 40-year-old faculty member and an 18-year-old-student.""
Concerns were raised about privacy and the motion's intrusiveness and scope.
Finally, a frustrated female senator in the back of the auditorium walked up to the microphone and moved to vote down the controversial motion.
Twenty senators voted in favor of the policy revision. One abstained from voting.
And with 62 votes against the changes, the motion was -- for the time being, at least -- dead.
Ossipov said the motion would be returned to Tompkins' committee for further revisions. ""However, this will come back,"" she said. There was uncomfortable laughter.
On January 26, the senate will hold its next vote on the revisions.
As the faculty senator who effectively silenced the conversation made her way back to her seat, Jasmine Lester glared at her, her middle finger raised in the air. ""This is my whole life,"" Lester said. ""And she just shot it down.""

Jasmine Lester is an Arizona native with ASU roots. She grew up in Ahwatukee, the child of a mother who handles internship programming at the university and a father who is a professor and former dean of humanities in the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Lester's parents aren't affiliated directly with Barrett.
Lester enrolled in the honors college in 2007. Like Jane, she formed a close relationship with a professor, who hasn't returned New Times' request for comment.
New Times is limiting the details of Lester's story because of ongoing legal action.
In conversations with New Times and in her Title IX complaint, Lester says her relationship with the professor took on a dynamic that extended beyond professional boundaries.
In 2010, Lester went to ASU's Office of Equity and Inclusion to discuss the matter with Kamala Green, the office's executive director and ASU's Title IX compliance coordinator.
Green's responsibilities include investigating Title IX violations when a faculty or staff member is the accused.
But Lester says Green didn't see her situation as a violation. ""I was trying to tell her that this is how the power dynamic creates an inherently abusive dynamic or situation,"" Lester says, ""but she didn't understand that. She kept being like, 'You don't know what rape is.'""
Lester says she felt unheard -- silenced, even -- by the school.
A university spokesman says Lester's claims were investigated and that there was no finding of any policy violation on the part of the professor. Green cannot comment on individual cases, but says, ""ASU takes these cases very seriously, and we investigate every one of them as quickly as we possibly can.""
Lester never got the outcome she wanted from ASU, but she funneled her frustration into helping others.
In 2013 -- two years after she graduated -- Lester founded Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, an advocacy group focused on connecting ASU students with the national Title IX movement. Through that work, she began collecting stories of abuse, and by June 2014, she had enough information to file a formal Title IX complaint against ASU. Lester's complaint, which is still under investigation, will be incorporated into the ongoing federal investigation of ASU.
""I know how administrators maintain the status quo,"" Lester says. ""They wait for people to graduate. I didn't leave after I graduated. I stayed bugging them about it for the next three years.""
Lester's complaint focuses on several areas: sexual violence in Greek culture, a lack of resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students on campus, and the culture at Barrett.
The Barrett portion names names. It tells stories of alleged abuse by 11 Barrett professors, many still employees of the school.
Lester's complaint also details the school's response to Jane.
Jane was devastated when Hunter broke off their relationship. She continued to see him on campus, and she says she became depressed to the point of attempting suicide. As time passed -- and after she learned of Lester's work on campus -- Jane says her view of the relationship changed.
""He took advantage of his power over me to coerce me,"" Jane says in an e-mail. ""This wasn't a consensual relationship. It was sexual abuse and it was rape.""
In the testimony she provided for Lester's complaint, Jane says she felt trapped by the need to maintain Hunter as a reference, as well as fear that coming forward would mar her reputation, make her feel unsafe, and harm her relationships with other faculty. So she didn't say anything.
But in March 2014, she broke down and told two Barrett professors about the affair. Without warning her, they reported the situation to Barrett's dean of students. Jane was asked to come in -- against her will -- for a meeting.
In a process she calls ""organized intimidation,"" Jane says she told her story to Barrett's deans, to campus counseling and advocacy offices, and eventually to Kamala Green.
""I was put through the ringer, dragged across campus to people I didn't want to talk to, not provided any university support like a victim's advocate or anything, and victim-blamed either directly or indirectly at every single step,"" she says in an e-mail.
Days after Green and Jane's meeting, Hunter was sent a letter releasing him from all duties, effective immediately.
Barrett's deans called for a meeting of the faculty. A former staff member who wishes to remain unidentified says faculty were told that any additional complaint of abuse by a professor would lead to the dissolution of the signature Human Event course.
Because that seminar distinguishes Barrett from the rest of ASU, its dissolution could mean Barrett faculty no longer would be necessary.
In June, three months after she first filed her complaint, Jane received a final written decision from the university provost, based on the investigation conducted by Green's office. The investigation found that Joel Hunter violated ASU's policy on amorous relationships, as well as the university's code of ethics, by engaging in a sexual relationship with Jane while she was in his class.
Hunter declined to be interviewed, but he did send New Times a brief comment by e-mail.
Hunter confirmed that his contract was not renewed because he violated ACD 402.
But he still speaks highly of Barrett. ""My experience was that it is a great culture with caring, supportive deans and staff, a stellar faculty who are committed to teaching excellence, and the brightest students I've ever had the pleasure to teach,"" he wrote.
Jane currently is a junior at the honors college. ""For the most part, I avoid Barrett,"" she says. ""I just go to classes, and I live off campus now, so it's not as bad. But the thing at Barrett is you always run into people you are trying to avoid. It's this wonderful honors community, where the deans and professors are always out socializing with the students,"" she says with obvious sarcasm.
""There are individually decent people in the administration,"" Jane notes. ""The problem is they can't change anything. There's nothing they can do as individuals to change the overwhelming institutional problems of rape culture and prioritizing the school's reputation over supporting victims.""
The very community that drew Jane to Barrett now is a disappointment to her. She points to the deans' treatment of her; the school's reporting process, which she says was marred by poor communication and missed deadlines; the faculty and staff who have ignored this problem for years; and the students who looked for reasons to blame her.
""They should really be ashamed of themselves,"" she says.

Dr. Eric Susser, an award-winning Barrett professor -- he was both the first non tenure-track recipient of the prestigious Founder's Day Faculty Achievement Award in Teaching and voted ""Hottest Professor"" in The State Press' annual poll on more than one occasion -- also had his contract dropped because of ACD 402 violations.
(New Times Managing Editor Amy Silverman and Susser's ex-wife, Deborah Sussman, have co-taught a local writing workshop for more than a decade.)
On www.ratemyprofessors.com, a national website on which students post anonymous professor reviews, comments show how the intimacy and intensity of the Human Event course can sometimes shift the tone of student-professor relationships down an inappropriate path.
Susser received the following comments from students in his class:
• 9/18/2005: ""Susser understands how to relate to college students. He's very entertaining and engaging. He's incredibly smart and the class is very thought-provoking . . . I loved this class. Plus I sort of had a crush on him.""
• 7/20/2010: ""Dr. Susser is wonderful! Not only did he take a special interest in me, he sought out students who needed extra help & made time for all of us to meet with him 1:1. If you need coaching for your writing or classroom participation, he's the guy to go to. But he's also full of himself. Don't let on that you think he's hot. Play it cool you'll be OK.""
Susser, who taught at Barrett for 15 years, developed and led the college's wildly popular trips to Paris. Like all Barrett professors, Susser pushed his Human Event students to join.
Rumors about inappropriate happenings on those trips swirled for years. A former Barrett staff member who wishes to remain anonymous says she heard students saying they wanted to go on the Paris trip specifically in hopes of sleeping with Susser.
The Paris trips eventually came to a stop, right around the time Susser left the school.
ASU hasn't fulfilled New Times' requests for copies of personnel files, including those of Susser, but Fox 10 News did obtain the records for a September 17 report.
According to documents shown in Fox 10's newscast, Susser's contract was not renewed in 2012 after he admitted to having sexual relationships with three Barrett students.
Susser, who divorced in 2005 and remarried in 2012, hasn't returned multiple requests for comment.
ASU did provide New Times with a July 2012 letter in which Barrett Dean Mark Jacobs notified Susser that he would not receive an annual academic year appointment.
Instead, Susser was offered a ""limited appointment"" for the fall semester only. He was told he would work on curriculum development, as a telecommuter, until his final date of employment on December 21 of that year. He no longer would have office space at Barrett -- he was given two weeks to clear out his personal belongings -- and he was told he no longer would teach or supervise student projects.
The letter doesn't detail why Susser's relationship with the school changed.
Though the university wouldn't share more detailed records with New Times, ASU Police Department records do describe the former professor's behavior.
According to one ASU police report, on the morning of March 31, 2014 -- 15 months after Susser's contract ended -- a staff member at the university's largest library, Hayden, found a brown bag that had been left behind on the second floor.
Inside, she located an ASU identification card with Eric Susser's name on it. She tried to e-mail Susser about the bag, but the e-mail -- likely because Susser no longer was employed by ASU -- didn't transmit.
The staff member continued to look and found more than she expected in the backpack. She contacted ASU's police.
Police listed the impounded bag's contents in their report. In addition to two ASU identification cards, a bill, and a MasterCard all bearing Susser's name, police found ""2 lancets, 3 meth pipes (one with residue), two pill containers (one possibly containing crystal meth), a bag of empty pill capsules, and a prescription bottle made out to Susser which contained various tablets.""
The tablets: ""oxycodone, amphetamine, Viagra,"" and more.
Police initially were unable to contact Susser -- his driver's license was suspended, they wrote in the report -- so the case was marked as pending. Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, says Susser recently was served with a no-trespass order barring him from campus.
But this wasn't Susser's first incident at ASU's libraries, or the ASU Police Department's first hint that the professor might be troubled.
Susser once was the subject of a handwritten field interrogation card, also drafted by ASU's police force. That 2002 document details some of the professor's other alleged extracurricular pursuits.
""Susser was contacted after a 101"" -- in police code, a 101 is a woman in a car -- ""said he exposed himself on the third floor of law library,"" police wrote.
The officer noted that a subject matching Susser's description was involved in a similar incident, in the same location, just two days before.
According to the report, Susser admitted to the officer that he was ""checking out women,"" but he denied having exposed himself.
The officer who wrote the report tells New Times he has no specific recollection of the incident.
But at the time, he clearly knew who Susser was. He listed Susser's ASU affiliation as ""faculty,"" and under employer, he wrote: ""ASU (Honors College).""
Just what happened after ASU police learned that the professor allegedly had flashed students is unclear.
The ASU Police Department says it no longer can find a copy of this document in its files. Kamala Green wasn't aware of the incident, though she wasn't in office at the time, and Mark Johnson, the university spokesman, hasn't provided specific comment on this report. For now, the trail ends at the ASU Police Department, which hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment.
Johnson says he doesn't know whether police notified Barrett or ASU administrators of the incident. ""Under current police department practice, the department would notify senior administrators and the relevant department,"" he says. ""I can't speak to what the practice may have been under the previous police administration.""
But one thing is clear: Susser kept his job for another decade after this report.
It's unknown whether Susser has found employment as a university professor, but he apparently has kept busy since leaving ASU. In June 2014, the Cooking Channel aired an episode of its show Belly Up! -- a kind of Bar Rescue rip-off -- titled ""Hidden Issues."" The episode focused on Susser's latest endeavor: a bar in West Phoenix called The Hideaway West Bar and Grill.
A student commenter on www.ratemyprofessors.com wrote of Susser in 2008: ""Susser is amazing because he lets the discussions go where they will and interjects when he has something important to say. Very intelligent professor, although a little slimy as a person.""

The problem at Barrett admittedly is complex.
Even 18-year-old freshmen are adults capable of giving consent under the law.
But experts tend to agree that stricter policies, such as the one ASU is considering, make more sense. Doctors can't sleep with patients and lawyers can't sleep with clients, so why should professors be able to sleep with their students?
Dr. Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, an expert on young adults, author of Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, says his research supports ""a taboo"" on all faculty-undergraduate relationships.
""It's almost inevitably exploitative,"" he says, ""even if neither side thinks of it that way.""
Arnett coined the term ""emerging adulthood"" to describe the time from 18 to 25 before people take on the full set of adult responsibilities, like career, marriage, and family. His research on emerging adults in many ways reflects common sense: People between these ages look and can act like grownups, but they just aren't equipped to make the greatest decisions.
""People's decision-making abilities are not as developed at 19 or 20 as they will be at 40 or 50,"" Arnett says. ""Do you really want to be 19 and in a class with a professor you like, and your roommate's dating him? That is weird by any standard, and it's disruptive to the central mission of the university, which is to teach young people, to prepare them for adult life.""
Seth Schwartz, a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and the incoming president of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, similarly is concerned.
""It's sort of hard to say no,"" Schwartz says. ""That's the major problem with these relationships between students and faculty: Are you willing to say no to someone who is in a position of authority over you?""

Dr. David Bruce Conz died with his pants around his ankles.
Conz, 39, was open with the university about a relationship he'd formed with a former student. But his tale took a tragic turn.
His autopsy report lays out what happened:
""Cause of death: gunshot wound to head and brain.""
""Manner: suicide.""
Under ""Diagnoses and Significant Findings,"" the medical examiner lists ""history of depression over work situation.""
Friends and family didn't see it coming.
Conz was a two-time ASU alum, and he began teaching at the school in 2005. A dedicated home brewer, Conz was nicknamed ""Professor Beer"" and led a popular ASU course in which students developed their own concoctions.
Conz formed a relationship with a Barrett freshman who recently had completed his Human Event course. Soon after, he shot himself in the mouth.
Rebekah Hollenberg was Conz's long-term girlfriend. The two met while swing dancing downtown, and they had been together for two and a half years at the time of his death.
""He studied do-it-yourself things, and he would make his own biodiesel and raise his own chickens,"" Hollenberg says. ""He was brilliant in so many ways.""
Conz and Hollenberg were polyamorous -- they were open with each other about dating other people -- and in late December 2012, Conz told Hollenberg that he was seeing a former student.
""The type of relationship we had is sort of unconventional and hard for people to understand,"" Hollenberg says. ""I was supportive of [the student] and Dave's relationship. I made them dinner. I gave them gifts. I wanted to make them happy.""
The former student asks not to be identified and declined to be interviewed for this story, but much of her tale is revealed in a detailed police report on Conz's death.
Around February 2013, Conz told Hollenberg he was called into a meeting at Barrett to discuss the relationship, ""a kind of review to see that everything was above board,"" she says.
Conz told Hollenberg that they were given the all-clear. The student no longer was in his class, so the relationship wasn't in violation of ASU policy.
Regardless, Conz began worrying about his job security after the meeting. He was scheduled for a formal contract renewal review later in the spring, and because Barrett doesn't offer its professors tenure, the meetings always made him nervous.
And then, the police report says, Conz accidentally received an e-mail that was about him but not for him, one that referenced an upcoming meeting of the deans to discuss his relationship with the student.
At his April 3 review, Conz was told that his contract wouldn't be renewed.
""It was just a shock for him,"" Hollenberg says. ""They told him that it was okay.""
The student later would tell police that Conz was terminated after it was reported to a Barrett dean that he had given her alcohol. Under state law and current ASU policy, it's more problematic for a professor to hand an underage student a beer than it is for him to sleep with her.
After his firing, Conz spiraled. ""He was kind of acting like his life was over,"" Hollenberg says. ""That was his identity, and it was sort of just taken so suddenly.""
She says she and Conz discussed their options -- moving to Vancouver, working full-time on DIY projects -- ""but he just wasn't able to get that vision yet,"" she says. ""And he was worried that if they put something in his record that seemed derogatory, he would never get another professorship anyway.""
Conz began drinking heavily.
Five days after he was fired, on April 8, 2013, Hollenberg became worried when Conz didn't pick her up for a date they had planned. She called him, and he sounded drunk. So she went to his house.
Meanwhile, the student told police that she had arrived at Conz's house about 5 that evening. She found him in bed, drunk, next to two bottles of Black Velvet Whisky -- one empty, the other half full -- and a loaded .38-caliber revolver at his side.
The student hid the revolver in a closet and called Conz's ex-wife, a psychiatrist. While they were on the phone, Conz ran from the house.
Hollenberg arrived about 5:30 and met Conz and the student in the driveway, where the student told her what was happening.
At 5:59, the student called police, who told her to keep Conz out of the house, away from the guns. When Conz tried to go inside, she tackled him.
Hollenberg told police that a full-fledged fight ensued, with the student and her former professor punching and kicking each other. She says Conz called the student ""cunt,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole.""
The student told police that Conz told her ""it was her fault, that she got him fired.""
Finally, Conz broke free, yelling at the student: ""You caused this.""
He ran into the house and locked the women out. They got inside using a spare key, and almost immediately they heard gunshots coming from the locked hallway bathroom. The first shot blasted through the door, passing just above the student's head. Seven seconds later, a second shot entered Conz's mouth.
Police found Conz seated on the toilet, his pants pulled down. The bathroom floor and wall were splattered with blood, and a silver revolver was on the floor. A bullet had exited through the top of Conz's skull.
Conz was conscious on the way to the hospital -- he admitted to paramedics that he'd shot himself -- but he was listed in critical condition upon arrival.
Hollenberg visited Conz frequently. Though he was unconscious, she sang to him, read to him, and talked to him.
Conz's mother removed him from life support on April 12, and he died later that day.
Months after his death, Conz's mother gave police a note she found on a torn piece of paper in his home. It's not clear who it was intended for, but police found the note significant enough to include in their report.
""Your love blossoms within me,"" Conz wrote. ""Like a parasite to liberate or embrace you I must die.""
Throughout his autopsy and the lengthy police report, Conz's job loss -- consistently tied to his relationship with the student -- is named as a key contributing factor in his suicide. In the course of their investigation, police even interviewed Frederick Corey, the dean who had let Conz go. Corey did not return requests for comment on Conz's case.
The student later provided testimony for Jasmine Lester's Title IX complaint. In it, she says she saw her relationship with Conz as above board. She'd even introduced him to her parents.
""The relationship was highly pleasurable and showed no outward signs of abuse besides the innate power imbalance that resides within a 20-year age gap,"" she wrote.
""He was loved by many, and still is.""
The student took off three semesters after Conz's death. She no longer speaks to Hollenberg, who moved to Illinois.
Never in her testimony does the student say she regrets dating Conz. Instead, she takes aim at ASU's rules on such relationships.
""We continued the relationship,"" she writes, ""because we realized ASU had no policy regarding faculty-student relationships as long as the student is no longer in the professor's class.""

http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/professor-travis-pratt-fired-from-asu-settles-with-student-who-sued-after-affair-6656294,"
Professor Travis Pratt's affair with a graduate student didn't work out so well.
The criminal-justice expert has agreed to settle the student's lawsuit at the end of this month. He and his wife are no longer married.
And he was fired from Arizona State University -- on Valentine's Day.

-Ex-ASU Student Sues for Harassment and Retaliation After Soured Affair With Professor
-ASU Professor's Soured Affair with Grad Student Still Grinding Through Court
Pratt was actually fired for an affair with a second student -- not Kunzi.
Pratt arrived at ASU in 2008 from Washington State University, a humorous and popular teacher whose research on crime and prisons have been published extensively. One his students, Tasha Kunzi, whose masters thesis committee Pratt had chaired, followed him out and enrolled in ASU's criminal-justice doctoral program. The two began a romantic affair that lasted until Pratt's wife found out.
Kunzi broke off the relationship, claiming that Pratt's wife had begun harassing her. According to a lawsuit she filed in October of 2012, Pratt then retaliated against her. She claimed that he stalked her home on his motorcycle, bugged her on the phone, spread rumors about her to people in the criminal-justice department and hassled her new boyfriend, who was also student in the department.
In responses to Kunzi's claims, Pratt did not refute the general allegations, instead focusing on defeating the lawsuit on technicalities. See our previous stories for full details.
Kunzi had also sued department director Scott Decker, ASU and the state Board of Regents. Those defendants were dismissed from the lawsuit last month.
Pratt and Kunzi, however, are to complete their settlement agreement by April 25, court records show. The settlement terms were not made public.
Kunzi could not be reached, and her lawyer, Stephen Montoya, did not return our messages last week and today.
We noticed today that Pratt's ASU bio and listing as a faculty member had disappeared. We inquired with ASU this afternoon, and spokeswoman Sharon Keeler sent this statement:""Professor Travis Pratt's employment with the University ended February 14, 2014. He was dismissed for violation of university policy as well as violation of ASU's Code of Ethics for faculty and the Standards of Professional Conduct for Faculty Members and Academic Professionals.""Kunzi, meanwhile, married her boyfriend and now has two kids.
UPDATE: After publication, ASU confirmed that Pratt was fired not due to Kunzi, but because he had violated amorous-relationship policies with another student.

http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/barrett-the-honors-college-at-asu-is-a-close-knit-community-some-say-too-close-6633269,"
One morning last spring, Becca Smouse, a first-year student at Arizona State University's Barrett, The Honors College, jumped in her car and headed to Tempe for her intensive freshman seminar course, the Human Event.
The Human Event in many ways is the linchpin of Barrett's programming. It covers an ambitious topic -- the history of human ideas -- and is designed to challenge how students think through intensive reading, writing, and discussion.
Through the Human Event class and subsequent study-abroad trips, Barrett students begin to form the strong relationships with professors they will need as they move on to become teaching assistants and interns, to seek supervisors for their honors theses, and to apply for graduate school and jobs. The class is important, and so are the relationships it helps students to form.
But that March day, Smouse and her classmates found an unexpected note on their classroom door. It informed them that their professor, Dr. Joel Hunter, wouldn't make it in that day, or for the rest of the week. 
Smouse found the message odd, especially because Hunter usually was very communicative and it was unlike him to let students come all the way to campus just to find out that class was canceled. ""Why didn't he just e-mail us?"" she wondered.
Turns out, Dr. Hunter was never coming back.
A substitute arrived the next week, and students were told that Hunter wouldn't return that semester. Smouse says she and other students were worried about him at first.
Then, rumors began to swirl. Jokes about Hunter getting fired for sleeping with a student soon turned into campus-wide gossip.
But Barrett's administration remained silent. Smouse says she was disappointed in the lack of transparency, especially given the tight-knit nature of the school.
And she began to hear another rumor: This wasn't the first time something like this had happened at Barrett.
When an anonymously written blog post confirmed the gossip about Hunter, Smouse, a young journalist in training, responded the only way she knew how. She wrote about it, in an April 14 opinion piece for ASU's campus newspaper, The State Press.
""Unfortunately, the professor's controversial dismissal seems to have been left largely untouched by Barrett administration,"" she wrote. ""Rumors buzzing and parental concerns rising, the spotlight is shining brightly on the college's lack of acknowledgement. Many also see firing the professor as a cop-out, simply sweeping the problem under the rug of Barrett embarrassments. By cutting out the professor, it seems the college hoped to avoid confronting the situation all together.""
Turns out, sweeping Barrett's troubles under the rug hasn't been so easy.

One of Rebecca Smouse's Barrett classmates, Jane -- who asked to not be identified by her real name -- also was disappointed in the school's response.
But Jane wasn't just a student in Joel Hunter's class. She also was his lover.
In an April 10 blog post for a website called Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, Jane laid out details about her relationship with Hunter, the process of reporting him to the school, and his subsequent dismissal.
In the first 72 hours after her post was published, an attached petition calling on Barrett's dean to fire predatory professors collected more than 400 signatures.
""For the past 15 years, ASU's Barrett Honors College has been home to professors who sexually harass and sexually abuse students,"" the petition says. ""While romantic relationships between professors and students may seem consensual, the imbalance of power makes these relationships inherently coercive and abusive.""
Today, the petition has more than 1,000 signatures.
Jane's story is not unique.
In the past few years, Barrett has terminated the contracts of at least three professors who engaged in sexual relationships with students. Joel Hunter and Dr. Eric Susser were told their contracts were not being renewed after they admitted to violating ASU's student-professor relationship policies, and Dr. David Conz committed suicide after his contract was dropped when a student reported he'd given alcohol to the Barrett freshman he was dating. Police records, documents given to New Times by involved students, and reports by other media outlets confirm the terminations.
But some say the number of Barrett faculty members skirting the rules -- and whose contracts may have been dropped -- actually is far higher.
Barrett administrators aren't talking, but Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, replied on their behalf. ""Such relationships are inappropriate and do not comport with how we expect members of the faculty and lecturers to behave,"" Johnson says, ""and when such relationships are brought to our attention, appropriate steps are taken.""
In a three-month investigation of the issues at Barrett, New Times interviewed former and current Barrett students and staff and reviewed hundreds of pages of internal university documents, written student testimonials provided to the government in a formal complaint, and police reports.
ASU president Michael Crow did not respond to an interview request. Many of New Times' public records requests -- asking for everything from personnel files to police reports on these and other cases -- went largely ignored or unfilled. Much is still unknown.
But one thing is clear: Inappropriate student-professor relationships at Barrett have been a poorly kept secret for years.
ASU has, in fact, had its share of troubles when it comes to sex.
In May 2014, just a few weeks after Jane's blog post was published, the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights made an unprecedented move: It announced the names of all schools being investigated for possible violations of Title IX, the federal legislation dictating how sexual violence and harassment complaints should be handled at schools that receive federal funding.
ASU was on the list of 55 schools. A Department of Education spokesman says the Office for Civil Rights is still investigating the university, but he did not provide further details.
For the most part, the problems at ASU have been linked to two worlds where these issues are better known: fraternities and athletics. ASU previously settled federal lawsuits dealing with the university's responses to two alleged sexual assaults, one involving a football player and the other a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.
But a Title IX complaint filed in June 2014 by Jasmine Lester, a former Barrett student, asks the Office for Civil Rights to focus on a different sexual abuse problem on campus: that of professors sleeping with their undergraduate students.
At Barrett, and across all of ASU, professor-student relationships are banned in certain contexts, like when a student is currently in a professor's class or when a professor is supervising a student's thesis. But this policy still allows room for involvement between professors and students.
And particularly at Barrett, which educates more than 5,000 of ASU's nearly 60,000 undergraduates, there have been repeated issues with professors skirting -- sometimes, even defying -- the rules.
Prestigious universities across the nation have drawn much harder lines in regard to such relationships. In 2010, Yale University banned faculty members from forming relationships with any undergraduate students, noting in its updated policy that undergrads ""are particularly vulnerable to the unequal institutional power inherent in the teacher-student relationship."" In 2013, the University of Connecticut implemented a similar ban.
Last fall, ASU's faculty senate debated whether to replace its own policy with an outright ban on professor-undergraduate relationships.
At a senate meeting in November, Cynthia Tompkins, chair of the committee drafting the proposed policy changes, referenced the scope of ASU's problem. She said at least 20 faculty members across ASU have been dismissed for having inappropriate sexual relationships with students in recent years.
ASU hasn't provided the exact number of dismissals stemming from Barrett or elsewhere. ""We do not keep a running tally of faculty who are disciplined for [relationship policy] violations,"" a spokesman says. A representative from the university office charged with investigating these policy violations wouldn't comment on how many investigations she has conducted.
But when ASU was named on the list of schools under federal review, Michael Crow did speak to The State Press' editorial board, and he addressed the problem at Barrett.
Student journalist Nicholas Palomino Mendoza reported on May 7, 2014, that Crow said he was aware of ""reports of inappropriate sexual conduct between Barrett faculty and students.""
""If it's consensual in a sense of the way that the law looks at things,"" Mendoza quotes Crow as saying, ""then it is inappropriate from the perspective of how we expect our faculty members or our instructors to behave.""
""There have been professors in relationships with students, and when we find out about it, they are all fired,"" Crow told the paper.
The revisions to ASU's professor-undergraduate relationship policy would aim to switch the school's focus from reactive to proactive, and from firing violators to improving the culture around these relationships on the front end.
At the first reading of the proposed revisions in early October, Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, made clear what the policy changes would mean.
""To put it rather bluntly,"" she said, ""ASU students are not part of your dating pool.""

Barrett, the Honors College, is a school within a school.
Admissions documents say Barrett consists of ""living-learning communities"" of academically driven students from across ASU's four campuses. Barrett is where the cream of the ASU crop goes to be educated.
Barrett marked its 25th anniversary in 2013. The University Honors College was granted official status in 1988, when it became the first residential honors college in the nation. It was renamed for former Intel CEO Craig Barrett and his wife, Barbara, a former ambassador to Finland and Arizona gubernatorial candidate, after they endowed the school with a $10 million gift in 2000. The college has undergone great growth in recent years, with its current student body size rivaling its alumni population.
In its admissions literature, Barrett distinguishes itself from the wider university. Though the majority of ASU students were in the top 25 percent of their graduating high school classes, for example, most Barrett students were in the top 10 percent. One year, students donned T-shirts that read ""_arrett, the Honors College. We don't get B's.""
All of Barrett's honors faculty fellows hold Ph.D.s, and the school boasts a 15-to-1 student-faculty ratio, small in comparison to ASU's ratio of 22-to-1. Students, sometimes called ""The Commas"" in a reference to the school's stuffy title, almost universally refer to Barrett as tight-knit.
The college's largest campus is at the corner of Apache Boulevard and Rural Road in Tempe, neatly tucked behind a set of iron gates on ASU's central campus. The Barrett campus is fully enclosed, and were it not for some classes they take elsewhere, Barrett students practically could spend their college lives there. Students are, in fact, expected to live on campus for at least their first two years.
Barrett's central campus is reminiscent of the exclusive private schools Barrett emulates. It's got everything but the ivy and, indeed, references to the Ivy League (Harvard of the Southwest, anyone?) are not uncommon. Some students jokingly refer to the campus as ""The Nerd Cage.""
Outside, students gather in groups and study in solitude on the sandstone benches surrounding Barrett's green lawns. There's an outdoor fireplace for cold-weather gatherings and a volleyball pit.
Inside, Barrett's buildings serve multiple purposes, reflecting the insular nature of the Barrett community. One can find professors' offices, student dorms, and classrooms interspersed throughout any given structure.
In the Honors Hall -- in many ways, the hub of Barrett life -- there's a gym with flat-screen TVs and elliptical machines, a spiral staircase leading downstairs to a coffee shop, and a recreational area with ping-pong tables.
There's also the beautiful Refectory, or, as students call it in a reference to Harry Potter's Hogwarts, the Great Hall. On a Friday afternoon in December, one student casually played the grand piano as others sat at long tables with high-backed chairs and feasted in the hall's wood-paneled dining room.
In an adjacent hallway, photographs of Barrett students who went on to win prestigious fellowships line the walls: 185 Fulbright scholars, 52 Marshall scholars, 54 Goldwater scholars. The list goes on.
Barrett students major in any field they choose, taking classes in the disciplinary college of their choice. One student says there can be tension between Barrett and the rest of ASU, in part because of the special privileges afforded to Barrett students. Barrett students get to register for classes before others, for example, and sometimes are offered special courses the general ASU population can't take.
This includes the Human Event, a mandatory two-semester seminar taken during freshmen year.
Barrett freshmen may take a different professor for each semester of the intensive course, but they are encouraged to stick with one. They also are encouraged to participate in for-credit, study-abroad trips with their professors during the summer after the course finishes.
The Human Event is ""a wonderful course to get students into the idea of working closely with a professor,"" says a former staff member who asked to not be identified. But she says she also believes the class has contributed to the problem of too-close professor-student relations.
""Because it was so friendly,"" she says, ""if you had any faculty members who were not terribly ethical in how they related to youngsters, it was a situation in which they could take advantage.""
With these professors, sources tell New Times, office hours turn into intimate meetings. Examination of the ancient Greeks may have an odd focus on the sexual relationships between mentors and mentees. Trips abroad are fueled more by alcohol than by learning.
To many, Barrett's very structure, intended to create a close learning community for students and professors alike, has instead become something sinister: a way for predatory teachers to grow close to -- sometimes, even sexually -- the young and ambitious students in their tutelage.

Jane first was drawn to Barrett because of its strong sense of community. She enrolled in the school in 2012.
Her story unfolds in her blog post, interviews and e-mails with New Times, and a pile of documents she provided to the government in a Title IX complaint against ASU. The documents include Jane's personal e-mails and text messages as well as copies of e-mails she received from ASU detailing the investigation into and eventual dismissal of Dr. Joel Hunter.
Hunter, a Barrett faculty member since 2008, admitted to the university and to New Times that he violated ASU's professor-undergraduate relationships policy before his contract was dropped.
On his personal website, Hunter lists the many awards he won during his time at Barrett, including accolades for teaching excellence, academic service, and faculty mentoring.
Since he left the school, Hunter also has posted a lengthy student tutorial on how to succeed in Barrett's difficult freshmen seminar course. ""It is best to err on the side of formality,"" he wrote in a late September post focused on how to best communicate with one's Human Event professor. These professors are ""incredibly friendly and funny, yes,"" he writes, ""but they are not in your peer group.""
It seems hindsight is 20/20.
By the end of Jane's fall semester in Hunter's Human Event class, she and the professor had grown close.
In December 2012, Hunter e-mailed Jane, asking her to interrupt a meeting so it wouldn't drag on. ""Plus, I would get to see one of my favorite Human Event students twice in one day,"" he wrote.
Jane signed up to take Hunter's class again in the spring.
By January 2013, the two began getting together regularly for meetings and meals. Soon, they were texting, and by early February, their texts hinted at a sexual relationship.
Some texts reference a trip the two took to a local park, where Jane says Hunter provided her with alcohol and massaged her, suggesting that doing so would be easier if she didn't have clothes on. They spent the afternoon kissing.
A few weeks later, Hunter texted Jane about 2 a.m. from a Harry Potter conference he was attending in Albuquerque:
Joel: get your ass to albuquerque now dammit. I just closed down the hotel bar with a harry potter student of mine who will not, i'm sure of it, sleep with me. All alone am i . . .
Jane alleges that Hunter shared with her sexual fantasies about other Human Event students and said he'd fallen in love with a student before.
The two went on to have a covert sexual relationship -- aside from the clear violation of policy, Hunter was married with children -- having sex in cars, in Hunter's office, and in parking garages around campus. Jane says Hunter gave her extensions on schoolwork because of their relationship.
In their talks, interspersed with innuendo, was conversation about Jane's future.
Texts from the day after their trip to the park:
Jane: How is my letter of recommendation coming? :)
Joel: It'll be done this afternoon.
And an hour later:
Joel: Letter submitted electronically. They won't be able to give you the scholarship quickly enough . . .
Jane: You mean I don't get to read it? Noooooooooooooo
Joel: I'll share it with you later. It's totally hot.
Then, in April of Jane's freshman year, Barrett Professor David Conz committed suicide shortly after his teaching contract was dropped. Conz's dismissal was linked to a relationship with one of his Human Event students. Jane says Hunter made out Conz to be the victim of an unfair administration and began expressing fears about losing his own job.
A text conversation in the days that followed:
Jane: I know you didn't want a hug, but are you ok? I don't think I've ever seen you look so sad.
Joel: Im ok. Shook up, sad and feeling vulnerable. Life. 
In May 2013, Jane and Hunter had sexual intercourse in a motel.
The spring semester came to a close, and Jane fully expected that she and Hunter would resume their relationship when she returned for her sophomore year. The two even texted occasionally during the summer.
But when Jane returned to campus in August, she says, Hunter told her he'd learned that their affair was risky after a discussion at a Barrett faculty retreat. He abruptly broke off the relationship.
""One thing my professor said to me when he ended this affair still sticks out to me,"" Jane wrote in the closing of her Title IX complaint testimony. ""He had no idea that what he was doing was wrong or even against the rules, because it was so common for Barrett Honors College professors to be involved with students that all of the honors faculty saw it as normal.""
Hunter declined to be interviewed, and New Times isn't aware of what he is up to today. On his personal website, he says he is a married father of three.

On a Monday afternoon in early November, Arizona State University's faculty senate gathered to discuss, among other things, a motion to revise the Academic Affairs Manual (ACD) policy governing ""amorous relationships"" between professors and students. That policy, ACD 402, has been on the books since 1982.
In Tempe's Education Lecture Hall, a single observer watched from a seat toward the back. Jasmine Lester, a 2011 Barrett grad, is a small woman with curly brown hair. She wears glasses and looks younger than her 25 years.
Helene Ossipov, president of the faculty senate, first laid out some ground rules. She asked senate members to refrain from dominating, and she made clear just who was invited to discuss this motion.
""Observers are welcome to observe as much as you want,"" she said. ""But be like children. You may be seen but not heard.""
For many years, ASU's amorous relationships guidelines fell under the university's sexual harassment policy. But in 2011, they were parsed to create a policy focused exclusively on consensual romantic or sexual student-professor relationships.
As written today, ACD 402 bans ASU employees from making key decisions -- grading, hiring, disciplining, or offering recommendations -- over anyone with whom they are in a sexual relationship. The policy bans faculty members from engaging in relationships with any students currently enrolled in their classes, and it says violations can result in disciplinary action up to termination.
But in 2014, the senate began considering revisions to ACD 402 that would give the policy much greater reach, banning all relationships between ASU faculty and undergraduate students.
If approved, the revisions would require faculty members to report any such relationships to a supervisor immediately, with policy exemptions made on a case-by-case basis.
""Our current policies regarding faculty-student relationships are inadequate as written,"" university spokesman Mark Johnson tells New Times. ""The faculty senate should be applauded for taking steps to strengthen those policies to ensure that faculty members and lecturers have only professional relationships with students.""
That November day, Cynthia Tompkins, who chaired the policy-revision task force, addressed the faculty senate. During the month-long comment period that preceded this meeting, she explained, many seemed to think the proposed revisions had come out of left field.
Tompkins acknowledged that professor-student relationships historically have had a wide range of acceptability -- you hear stories of professor-student couples that happily marry, she noted -- but she said many unacceptable versions have taken place at ASU in recent years.
In addition to the 20 firings mentioned above, Tompkins said, ASU has had at least one unwanted student-professor pregnancy this year.
The intent of the policy revisions, she said, is to put students back at the center of focus.
The floor was opened for discussion. Faculty members approached the microphone to raise questions and concerns.
Many were worried about the scope of the revised language. ASU is a big school. Would professors need to start IDing everyone they meet in Tempe?
The new language doesn't make clear just which relationships would be exempt. What about pre-existing ones? And what would happen if a professor reports a relationship and doesn't get an exemption?
""You really think about whether you want that relationship,"" Ossipov answered. ""One person would have to leave the university.""
Tensions rose.
""I want to be blunt. I think this policy is very invasive,"" a female faculty member said. ""Every amorous relationship is not a 40-year-old faculty member and an 18-year-old-student.""
Concerns were raised about privacy and the motion's intrusiveness and scope.
Finally, a frustrated female senator in the back of the auditorium walked up to the microphone and moved to vote down the controversial motion.
Twenty senators voted in favor of the policy revision. One abstained from voting.
And with 62 votes against the changes, the motion was -- for the time being, at least -- dead.
Ossipov said the motion would be returned to Tompkins' committee for further revisions. ""However, this will come back,"" she said. There was uncomfortable laughter.
On January 26, the senate will hold its next vote on the revisions.
As the faculty senator who effectively silenced the conversation made her way back to her seat, Jasmine Lester glared at her, her middle finger raised in the air. ""This is my whole life,"" Lester said. ""And she just shot it down.""

Jasmine Lester is an Arizona native with ASU roots. She grew up in Ahwatukee, the child of a mother who handles internship programming at the university and a father who is a professor and former dean of humanities in the College of Liberal Arts and Science. Lester's parents aren't affiliated directly with Barrett.
Lester enrolled in the honors college in 2007. Like Jane, she formed a close relationship with a professor, who hasn't returned New Times' request for comment.
New Times is limiting the details of Lester's story because of ongoing legal action.
In conversations with New Times and in her Title IX complaint, Lester says her relationship with the professor took on a dynamic that extended beyond professional boundaries.
In 2010, Lester went to ASU's Office of Equity and Inclusion to discuss the matter with Kamala Green, the office's executive director and ASU's Title IX compliance coordinator.
Green's responsibilities include investigating Title IX violations when a faculty or staff member is the accused.
But Lester says Green didn't see her situation as a violation. ""I was trying to tell her that this is how the power dynamic creates an inherently abusive dynamic or situation,"" Lester says, ""but she didn't understand that. She kept being like, 'You don't know what rape is.'""
Lester says she felt unheard -- silenced, even -- by the school.
A university spokesman says Lester's claims were investigated and that there was no finding of any policy violation on the part of the professor. Green cannot comment on individual cases, but says, ""ASU takes these cases very seriously, and we investigate every one of them as quickly as we possibly can.""
Lester never got the outcome she wanted from ASU, but she funneled her frustration into helping others.
In 2013 -- two years after she graduated -- Lester founded Sun Devils Against Sexual Assault, an advocacy group focused on connecting ASU students with the national Title IX movement. Through that work, she began collecting stories of abuse, and by June 2014, she had enough information to file a formal Title IX complaint against ASU. Lester's complaint, which is still under investigation, will be incorporated into the ongoing federal investigation of ASU.
""I know how administrators maintain the status quo,"" Lester says. ""They wait for people to graduate. I didn't leave after I graduated. I stayed bugging them about it for the next three years.""
Lester's complaint focuses on several areas: sexual violence in Greek culture, a lack of resources for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer students on campus, and the culture at Barrett.
The Barrett portion names names. It tells stories of alleged abuse by 11 Barrett professors, many still employees of the school.
Lester's complaint also details the school's response to Jane.
Jane was devastated when Hunter broke off their relationship. She continued to see him on campus, and she says she became depressed to the point of attempting suicide. As time passed -- and after she learned of Lester's work on campus -- Jane says her view of the relationship changed.
""He took advantage of his power over me to coerce me,"" Jane says in an e-mail. ""This wasn't a consensual relationship. It was sexual abuse and it was rape.""
In the testimony she provided for Lester's complaint, Jane says she felt trapped by the need to maintain Hunter as a reference, as well as fear that coming forward would mar her reputation, make her feel unsafe, and harm her relationships with other faculty. So she didn't say anything.
But in March 2014, she broke down and told two Barrett professors about the affair. Without warning her, they reported the situation to Barrett's dean of students. Jane was asked to come in -- against her will -- for a meeting.
In a process she calls ""organized intimidation,"" Jane says she told her story to Barrett's deans, to campus counseling and advocacy offices, and eventually to Kamala Green.
""I was put through the ringer, dragged across campus to people I didn't want to talk to, not provided any university support like a victim's advocate or anything, and victim-blamed either directly or indirectly at every single step,"" she says in an e-mail.
Days after Green and Jane's meeting, Hunter was sent a letter releasing him from all duties, effective immediately.
Barrett's deans called for a meeting of the faculty. A former staff member who wishes to remain unidentified says faculty were told that any additional complaint of abuse by a professor would lead to the dissolution of the signature Human Event course.
Because that seminar distinguishes Barrett from the rest of ASU, its dissolution could mean Barrett faculty no longer would be necessary.
In June, three months after she first filed her complaint, Jane received a final written decision from the university provost, based on the investigation conducted by Green's office. The investigation found that Joel Hunter violated ASU's policy on amorous relationships, as well as the university's code of ethics, by engaging in a sexual relationship with Jane while she was in his class.
Hunter declined to be interviewed, but he did send New Times a brief comment by e-mail.
Hunter confirmed that his contract was not renewed because he violated ACD 402.
But he still speaks highly of Barrett. ""My experience was that it is a great culture with caring, supportive deans and staff, a stellar faculty who are committed to teaching excellence, and the brightest students I've ever had the pleasure to teach,"" he wrote.
Jane currently is a junior at the honors college. ""For the most part, I avoid Barrett,"" she says. ""I just go to classes, and I live off campus now, so it's not as bad. But the thing at Barrett is you always run into people you are trying to avoid. It's this wonderful honors community, where the deans and professors are always out socializing with the students,"" she says with obvious sarcasm.
""There are individually decent people in the administration,"" Jane notes. ""The problem is they can't change anything. There's nothing they can do as individuals to change the overwhelming institutional problems of rape culture and prioritizing the school's reputation over supporting victims.""
The very community that drew Jane to Barrett now is a disappointment to her. She points to the deans' treatment of her; the school's reporting process, which she says was marred by poor communication and missed deadlines; the faculty and staff who have ignored this problem for years; and the students who looked for reasons to blame her.
""They should really be ashamed of themselves,"" she says.

Dr. Eric Susser, an award-winning Barrett professor -- he was both the first non tenure-track recipient of the prestigious Founder's Day Faculty Achievement Award in Teaching and voted ""Hottest Professor"" in The State Press' annual poll on more than one occasion -- also had his contract dropped because of ACD 402 violations.
(New Times Managing Editor Amy Silverman and Susser's ex-wife, Deborah Sussman, have co-taught a local writing workshop for more than a decade.)
On www.ratemyprofessors.com, a national website on which students post anonymous professor reviews, comments show how the intimacy and intensity of the Human Event course can sometimes shift the tone of student-professor relationships down an inappropriate path.
Susser received the following comments from students in his class:
• 9/18/2005: ""Susser understands how to relate to college students. He's very entertaining and engaging. He's incredibly smart and the class is very thought-provoking . . . I loved this class. Plus I sort of had a crush on him.""
• 7/20/2010: ""Dr. Susser is wonderful! Not only did he take a special interest in me, he sought out students who needed extra help & made time for all of us to meet with him 1:1. If you need coaching for your writing or classroom participation, he's the guy to go to. But he's also full of himself. Don't let on that you think he's hot. Play it cool you'll be OK.""
Susser, who taught at Barrett for 15 years, developed and led the college's wildly popular trips to Paris. Like all Barrett professors, Susser pushed his Human Event students to join.
Rumors about inappropriate happenings on those trips swirled for years. A former Barrett staff member who wishes to remain anonymous says she heard students saying they wanted to go on the Paris trip specifically in hopes of sleeping with Susser.
The Paris trips eventually came to a stop, right around the time Susser left the school.
ASU hasn't fulfilled New Times' requests for copies of personnel files, including those of Susser, but Fox 10 News did obtain the records for a September 17 report.
According to documents shown in Fox 10's newscast, Susser's contract was not renewed in 2012 after he admitted to having sexual relationships with three Barrett students.
Susser, who divorced in 2005 and remarried in 2012, hasn't returned multiple requests for comment.
ASU did provide New Times with a July 2012 letter in which Barrett Dean Mark Jacobs notified Susser that he would not receive an annual academic year appointment.
Instead, Susser was offered a ""limited appointment"" for the fall semester only. He was told he would work on curriculum development, as a telecommuter, until his final date of employment on December 21 of that year. He no longer would have office space at Barrett -- he was given two weeks to clear out his personal belongings -- and he was told he no longer would teach or supervise student projects.
The letter doesn't detail why Susser's relationship with the school changed.
Though the university wouldn't share more detailed records with New Times, ASU Police Department records do describe the former professor's behavior.
According to one ASU police report, on the morning of March 31, 2014 -- 15 months after Susser's contract ended -- a staff member at the university's largest library, Hayden, found a brown bag that had been left behind on the second floor.
Inside, she located an ASU identification card with Eric Susser's name on it. She tried to e-mail Susser about the bag, but the e-mail -- likely because Susser no longer was employed by ASU -- didn't transmit.
The staff member continued to look and found more than she expected in the backpack. She contacted ASU's police.
Police listed the impounded bag's contents in their report. In addition to two ASU identification cards, a bill, and a MasterCard all bearing Susser's name, police found ""2 lancets, 3 meth pipes (one with residue), two pill containers (one possibly containing crystal meth), a bag of empty pill capsules, and a prescription bottle made out to Susser which contained various tablets.""
The tablets: ""oxycodone, amphetamine, Viagra,"" and more.
Police initially were unable to contact Susser -- his driver's license was suspended, they wrote in the report -- so the case was marked as pending. Mark Johnson, an ASU spokesman, says Susser recently was served with a no-trespass order barring him from campus.
But this wasn't Susser's first incident at ASU's libraries, or the ASU Police Department's first hint that the professor might be troubled.
Susser once was the subject of a handwritten field interrogation card, also drafted by ASU's police force. That 2002 document details some of the professor's other alleged extracurricular pursuits.
""Susser was contacted after a 101"" -- in police code, a 101 is a woman in a car -- ""said he exposed himself on the third floor of law library,"" police wrote.
The officer noted that a subject matching Susser's description was involved in a similar incident, in the same location, just two days before.
According to the report, Susser admitted to the officer that he was ""checking out women,"" but he denied having exposed himself.
The officer who wrote the report tells New Times he has no specific recollection of the incident.
But at the time, he clearly knew who Susser was. He listed Susser's ASU affiliation as ""faculty,"" and under employer, he wrote: ""ASU (Honors College).""
Just what happened after ASU police learned that the professor allegedly had flashed students is unclear.
The ASU Police Department says it no longer can find a copy of this document in its files. Kamala Green wasn't aware of the incident, though she wasn't in office at the time, and Mark Johnson, the university spokesman, hasn't provided specific comment on this report. For now, the trail ends at the ASU Police Department, which hasn't responded to multiple requests for comment.
Johnson says he doesn't know whether police notified Barrett or ASU administrators of the incident. ""Under current police department practice, the department would notify senior administrators and the relevant department,"" he says. ""I can't speak to what the practice may have been under the previous police administration.""
But one thing is clear: Susser kept his job for another decade after this report.
It's unknown whether Susser has found employment as a university professor, but he apparently has kept busy since leaving ASU. In June 2014, the Cooking Channel aired an episode of its show Belly Up! -- a kind of Bar Rescue rip-off -- titled ""Hidden Issues."" The episode focused on Susser's latest endeavor: a bar in West Phoenix called The Hideaway West Bar and Grill.
A student commenter on www.ratemyprofessors.com wrote of Susser in 2008: ""Susser is amazing because he lets the discussions go where they will and interjects when he has something important to say. Very intelligent professor, although a little slimy as a person.""

The problem at Barrett admittedly is complex.
Even 18-year-old freshmen are adults capable of giving consent under the law.
But experts tend to agree that stricter policies, such as the one ASU is considering, make more sense. Doctors can't sleep with patients and lawyers can't sleep with clients, so why should professors be able to sleep with their students?
Dr. Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, an expert on young adults, author of Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties, and professor at Clark University in Massachusetts, says his research supports ""a taboo"" on all faculty-undergraduate relationships.
""It's almost inevitably exploitative,"" he says, ""even if neither side thinks of it that way.""
Arnett coined the term ""emerging adulthood"" to describe the time from 18 to 25 before people take on the full set of adult responsibilities, like career, marriage, and family. His research on emerging adults in many ways reflects common sense: People between these ages look and can act like grownups, but they just aren't equipped to make the greatest decisions.
""People's decision-making abilities are not as developed at 19 or 20 as they will be at 40 or 50,"" Arnett says. ""Do you really want to be 19 and in a class with a professor you like, and your roommate's dating him? That is weird by any standard, and it's disruptive to the central mission of the university, which is to teach young people, to prepare them for adult life.""
Seth Schwartz, a professor at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine and the incoming president of the Society for the Study of Emerging Adulthood, similarly is concerned.
""It's sort of hard to say no,"" Schwartz says. ""That's the major problem with these relationships between students and faculty: Are you willing to say no to someone who is in a position of authority over you?""

Dr. David Bruce Conz died with his pants around his ankles.
Conz, 39, was open with the university about a relationship he'd formed with a former student. But his tale took a tragic turn.
His autopsy report lays out what happened:
""Cause of death: gunshot wound to head and brain.""
""Manner: suicide.""
Under ""Diagnoses and Significant Findings,"" the medical examiner lists ""history of depression over work situation.""
Friends and family didn't see it coming.
Conz was a two-time ASU alum, and he began teaching at the school in 2005. A dedicated home brewer, Conz was nicknamed ""Professor Beer"" and led a popular ASU course in which students developed their own concoctions.
Conz formed a relationship with a Barrett freshman who recently had completed his Human Event course. Soon after, he shot himself in the mouth.
Rebekah Hollenberg was Conz's long-term girlfriend. The two met while swing dancing downtown, and they had been together for two and a half years at the time of his death.
""He studied do-it-yourself things, and he would make his own biodiesel and raise his own chickens,"" Hollenberg says. ""He was brilliant in so many ways.""
Conz and Hollenberg were polyamorous -- they were open with each other about dating other people -- and in late December 2012, Conz told Hollenberg that he was seeing a former student.
""The type of relationship we had is sort of unconventional and hard for people to understand,"" Hollenberg says. ""I was supportive of [the student] and Dave's relationship. I made them dinner. I gave them gifts. I wanted to make them happy.""
The former student asks not to be identified and declined to be interviewed for this story, but much of her tale is revealed in a detailed police report on Conz's death.
Around February 2013, Conz told Hollenberg he was called into a meeting at Barrett to discuss the relationship, ""a kind of review to see that everything was above board,"" she says.
Conz told Hollenberg that they were given the all-clear. The student no longer was in his class, so the relationship wasn't in violation of ASU policy.
Regardless, Conz began worrying about his job security after the meeting. He was scheduled for a formal contract renewal review later in the spring, and because Barrett doesn't offer its professors tenure, the meetings always made him nervous.
And then, the police report says, Conz accidentally received an e-mail that was about him but not for him, one that referenced an upcoming meeting of the deans to discuss his relationship with the student.
At his April 3 review, Conz was told that his contract wouldn't be renewed.
""It was just a shock for him,"" Hollenberg says. ""They told him that it was okay.""
The student later would tell police that Conz was terminated after it was reported to a Barrett dean that he had given her alcohol. Under state law and current ASU policy, it's more problematic for a professor to hand an underage student a beer than it is for him to sleep with her.
After his firing, Conz spiraled. ""He was kind of acting like his life was over,"" Hollenberg says. ""That was his identity, and it was sort of just taken so suddenly.""
She says she and Conz discussed their options -- moving to Vancouver, working full-time on DIY projects -- ""but he just wasn't able to get that vision yet,"" she says. ""And he was worried that if they put something in his record that seemed derogatory, he would never get another professorship anyway.""
Conz began drinking heavily.
Five days after he was fired, on April 8, 2013, Hollenberg became worried when Conz didn't pick her up for a date they had planned. She called him, and he sounded drunk. So she went to his house.
Meanwhile, the student told police that she had arrived at Conz's house about 5 that evening. She found him in bed, drunk, next to two bottles of Black Velvet Whisky -- one empty, the other half full -- and a loaded .38-caliber revolver at his side.
The student hid the revolver in a closet and called Conz's ex-wife, a psychiatrist. While they were on the phone, Conz ran from the house.
Hollenberg arrived about 5:30 and met Conz and the student in the driveway, where the student told her what was happening.
At 5:59, the student called police, who told her to keep Conz out of the house, away from the guns. When Conz tried to go inside, she tackled him.
Hollenberg told police that a full-fledged fight ensued, with the student and her former professor punching and kicking each other. She says Conz called the student ""cunt,"" ""bitch,"" and ""asshole.""
The student told police that Conz told her ""it was her fault, that she got him fired.""
Finally, Conz broke free, yelling at the student: ""You caused this.""
He ran into the house and locked the women out. They got inside using a spare key, and almost immediately they heard gunshots coming from the locked hallway bathroom. The first shot blasted through the door, passing just above the student's head. Seven seconds later, a second shot entered Conz's mouth.
Police found Conz seated on the toilet, his pants pulled down. The bathroom floor and wall were splattered with blood, and a silver revolver was on the floor. A bullet had exited through the top of Conz's skull.
Conz was conscious on the way to the hospital -- he admitted to paramedics that he'd shot himself -- but he was listed in critical condition upon arrival.
Hollenberg visited Conz frequently. Though he was unconscious, she sang to him, read to him, and talked to him.
Conz's mother removed him from life support on April 12, and he died later that day.
Months after his death, Conz's mother gave police a note she found on a torn piece of paper in his home. It's not clear who it was intended for, but police found the note significant enough to include in their report.
""Your love blossoms within me,"" Conz wrote. ""Like a parasite to liberate or embrace you I must die.""
Throughout his autopsy and the lengthy police report, Conz's job loss -- consistently tied to his relationship with the student -- is named as a key contributing factor in his suicide. In the course of their investigation, police even interviewed Frederick Corey, the dean who had let Conz go. Corey did not return requests for comment on Conz's case.
The student later provided testimony for Jasmine Lester's Title IX complaint. In it, she says she saw her relationship with Conz as above board. She'd even introduced him to her parents.
""The relationship was highly pleasurable and showed no outward signs of abuse besides the innate power imbalance that resides within a 20-year age gap,"" she wrote.
""He was loved by many, and still is.""
The student took off three semesters after Conz's death. She no longer speaks to Hollenberg, who moved to Illinois.
Never in her testimony does the student say she regrets dating Conz. Instead, she takes aim at ASU's rules on such relationships.
""We continued the relationship,"" she writes, ""because we realized ASU had no policy regarding faculty-student relationships as long as the student is no longer in the professor's class.""

The letter said his contract was not being renewed because of an admission he made to the executive director for the Office of Equity and Inclusion on March 18, 2014. In 2015, the Phoenix New Times, an independent media company, reported that ASU had terminated the contracts of at least three professors, including Hunter, who engaged in sexual relationships with students. ASU's student publication, The State Press, interviewed the student who said she had the relationship with Hunter in 2014.

The story included allegations of inappropriate comments and behavior from multiple women. Krauss has strongly denied the allegations. Krauss founded the Origins Project and has been director since it began in 2009.The project holds workshops and events focusing on the origins of the universe and life.

Then, the faculty member can challenge the recommendation in what is called a conciliation or mediation, and a conciliation committee comprised of faculty members is set up.RELATED:ASU professor Krauss put on leave amid allegations of sexual misconductKrauss is in the conciliation process right now, a university spokesman said. Kenney, Krauss and the president of the University Senate all appointed one member to serve on the committee.The conciliation committee's goal is to find a ""mutually agreed upon solution,"" according to Board of Regents' policy.If the conciliation process fails, Crow can issue a written notice of dismissal. Krauss could then appeal this notice to the Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure and receive a hearing.The committee makes a recommendation to Crow, who then makes a decision on dismissal. Krauss has another opportunity to ask for reconsideration before a final decision from Crow.The entire process can take many months. READ MORE:"
https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/13/2-professors-resign-amid-rape-charges,"Amid allegations of rape from a former student, two professors at Arkansas State University resigned this month, just as the institution was reportedly planning to fire them.
The 25-year-old female Arkansas State University student accused Gregory Russell, an associate professor, and his wife, Ellen Lemley, an assistant professor, of raping her at their home on the night of April 19. Both professors were in the department of criminology, sociology and geography.
The student, whose identity Inside Higher Ed will protect consistent with its policy of not identifying victims of alleged sex crimes, reported the rape to the university before the couple resigned on June 1 but not to Jonesboro law-enforcement officials until June 6, when she applied for ""orders of protection"" against the couple. In statements submitted to Craighead County Circuit Court, the student said she “took steps to let ASU know that I had been raped by the couple and after investigation, they were to be terminated, but instead resigned on June 1, 2007.”
The student accused the couple of drugging her at a restaurant and then raping her at their home. She said she feared that they would “retaliate against me” for losing their jobs and because Russell had “continued to harass me through phone calls, messages and in person .”
Arkansas State's communications director, Tom Moore, confirmed that Russell and Lemley had resigned from the university on June 1. Citing confidentiality of personnel files, he declined to say whether the university had been considering firing the couple at the time they quit or to provide any further information about the investigation.
Glen Jones, Arkansas State’s interim vice chancellor for academic affairs and research, released a statement on June 7 in which he said the university has “a zero-tolerance policy against sexual harassment and will not tolerate any employee or student violating this policy.”
Jones added that when there is an allegation of sexual harassment, the university “promptly investigate[s] and, when an allegation is determined to be valid, an appropriate remedy is identified and implemented.”
Neither Russell nor Lemley, nor their lawyer, could be reached for comment; calls to the professors' offices and to their home were not returned. But Russell told the Jonesboro Sun that “everything that happened was consensual.” Russell also told a local television station, KAIT-8, that the couple's lawyer was preparing a libel/slander lawsuit against the student and possibly others.
The Student’s Perspective
The student’s lawyer, Paul N. Ford, was unavailable for comment. In her statement to local authorities, the student said that the professors had invited her and her friends to join them at their table at Brickhouse Grill in downtown Jonesboro, less than two miles from the Arkansas State campus. The student said she had taken classes with both professors.
“It is believed,” the student said in her statement, “that Dr. Russell drugged my drinks with Dr. Lemley’s knowledge.”
The student said that she “blacked out” and didn’t “remember anything from sitting at the table to waking up naked and covered in blood” from her waist to her thighs in the professors' home.
Russell, the student said in her statement, told her that she had been “so messed up” the previous night that he needed to carry her out of the restaurant. Then, the student alleges, Lemley joined the student in the bed where she had woken up and lay down there. Russell later drove the student back to her apartment, the statement said.
She alleged that days later, Russell and Lemley began leaving her voice mail messages expressing their feelings for the student and urging her to ""be with"" Russell.
Craighead County Judge Barbara Halsey denied the request for orders of protection against Russell and Lemley, ruling that the case did not fall under Arkansas’ Domestic Abuse Act.
Copies of the voice mail recordings were given to police, Detective Ernest Ward said, adding that he has received 325 pages of e-mail messages, instant message logs and handwritten statements from Arkansas State students and others who know the couple.
Ward said he has yet to find evidence supporting the student’s claim in those documents. “Nothing that I’ve read so far [is pertinent],” he said. “But that doesn’t mean I won’t turn the page and find something that can be used as evidence.” Because the alleged rape happened nearly two months ago, Ward said his investigation relies on what he learns from the student and the professors, as well as the contents of the documents and voice mail recordings he has received.
He is to interview Russell and Lemley on Thursday, he said, “once their lawyer gets back to town.”
The Professors
Russell and Lemley have followed each other across the country since the early 1990s, co-writing articles and book chapters, and teaching classes together.
In 1994, Lemley received a bachelor’s degree from California State University at Chico, where Russell was an assistant professor and later an associate professor from 1990 until 1996, according to their respective curricula vitae posted on the Arkansas State Web site.
They then moved to Washington State University, where Lemley earned a master’s degree in criminal justice in 1998 and a doctorate in political science in 2004. Russell, meanwhile, was an associate professor of political science and criminal justice there from 1996 until 2002.
From Washington State, Russell and Lemley moved to Arkansas State, where Russell was an associate professor of criminology and director of the university’s programs in criminology and forensic science. Lemley began there as an instructor in 2002 but became an assistant professor upon completion of her doctorate.

http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/726/1222/188548/,"Dr. William E. Korf appeals the district court's decision granting summary judgment to the defendants in an action brought by Dr. Korf following his termination as a tenured Associate Professor of Music History and Musicology at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana. On appeal Dr. Korf argues that the entry of summary judgment was an improper denial of his due process and equal protection claims, and his challenge to the defendants' qualified immunity. Dr. Korf also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him the opportunity to conduct further discovery and in holding that the Eleventh Amendment provides defendants with immunity from prospective and injunctive relief. We AFFIRM. In February, 1981, Dr. Korf was informed by Lloyd Nelson, Dean of Ball State's College of Fine and Applied Arts, that certain of his current and former male students had accused him of sexual harassment. The students alleged that the harassment consisted of Dr. Korf's making unwelcomed sexual advances towards them and offering good grades contingent upon sexual involvement. Dean Nelson informed Dr. Korf that he intended to commence termination proceedings against him, and provided him the opportunity to resign. Dr. Korf denied the accusations and refused to resign. In accordance with established procedures, a committee was formed to investigate the charges. On April 2, 1981, the committee concluded that sufficient grounds existed to institute formal termination proceedings against Dr. Korf. The president of Ball State, Dr. Robert P. Bell, reviewed the committee's recommendation and informed Dr. Korf of the committee's findings. Based on those findings, on April 24, 1981, Dr. Bell told Dr. Korf that formal termination proceedings were being commenced and that he had the right to a hearing before an  hoc hearing committee, drawn from the University Senate Judicial Committee, to determine whether or not Dr. Korf should be removed from his position. Dr. Korf requested a hearing and the University complied with his request on May 20, 1981. At that hearing, a student related the relationship he had had with Dr. Korf and testified that Dr. Korf gave him money and gifts in exchange for sexual acts.  In addition, the student alleged that he was promised good grades. While denying that grades were involved, Dr. Korf admitted his sexual involvement with this student. The committee also heard testimony from three individuals and had statements of four other individuals who recounted Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards them while or after they were his students. On May 21, 1981, the committee made the following findings: ""Based on the evidence provided at the hearing on May 20, 1981, we find Dr. William E. Korf guilty of unethical conduct because he used his position and influence as a teacher to exploit students for his private advantage. The evidence indicates a pattern of behavior in which he frequently built a personal, friendly relationship, followed by sexual advances, often in his home. ""This pattern was evidenced by the testimony of six (6) witnesses who were either present or submitted signed statements ... and by two (2) individuals who made statements to the Affirmative Action Officer .... These eight (8) people are current or former students in one or more of Dr. Korf's classes. ""We find insufficient evidence to support the allegation that Dr. Korf encouraged dishonest academic conduct."" The committee based its finding that Dr. Korf engaged in unethical conduct on paragraph 2 of the American Association of University Professors (""AAUP"") Statement on Professional Ethics which was adopted by Ball State University in 1967 and published in its Faculty Handbook.  Even though the committee found Dr. Korf guilty of unethical conduct, they recommended only that Dr. Korf be placed on a three-year period of probation, rather than discharged, because they did not feel that he had been provided ""ample warning and opportunity for behavioral change."" Pursuant to established procedures, the Board of Trustees was presented with the hearing committee's report. After hearing arguments from University representatives and counsel for Dr. Korf on July 6, 1981, the Trustees agreed with the committee's finding of unethical conduct but refused to accept the committee's disciplinary recommendation of three years probation and directed that the committee's report and recommendations be returned to them for reconsideration. Upon reconsideration, the hearing committee, after a ""close re-examination of the statement of ethics in the Faculty Handbook "" and because of the realistic unenforceability of some of the proposed conditions of probation,  reversed its prior recommendation of probation and recommended that Dr. Korf be discharged from the University. Based upon this recommendation the Trustees terminated Dr. Korf's employment on July 24, 1981. Dr. Korf initiated this action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on May 21, 1982, seeking both legal and equitable relief. The six-count complaint alleged violations of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process, equal protection, free speech, freedom of association, and privacy, along with state law claims for breach of his employment contract and infliction of emotional distress. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss alleging that: (1) they possessed immunity both under the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified immunity; (2) none of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights were violated; and (3) Dr. Korf's employment contract was not breached and his emotional distress claim was insufficient. The motion was accompanied by an affidavit from the President of the Ball State University Board of Trustees delineating the basis for Dr. Korf's termination. Attached to the affidavit was the transcript of the formal hearing and all the exhibits presented. On August 5, 1982, Dr. Korf moved for a continuance to allow him to respond to the defendants' motion to dismiss until after discovery. Alternatively, he moved for an enlargement of time to respond to the defendants' motion. The court granted his alternative motion. On March 11, 1983 the district court granted defendants summary judgment  on Dr. Korf's constitutional and state law claims.  The court concluded that Ball State University was an instrumentality of the State of Indiana for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore the University, its Board of Trustees and the individual defendants in their official capacities were immune from suit under Sec. 1983. Because the affidavits presented on Dr. Korf's behalf failed to provide any evidence sufficient to create a genuine question whether the individual defendants acted in bad faith, the court also ruled that the defendants were immune from Sec. 1983 liability under the doctrine of qualified or ""good faith"" immunity. The main question we must decide is whether or not the district court committed error in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment. Dr. Korf contends that since there were disputed issues of material fact concerning his substantive due process and equal protection claims, summary judgment was improper. Dr. Korf also argues that even if he has not created genuine issues of material fact regarding these constitutional claims, the trial court erred by failing to grant him sufficient time to conduct the necessary discovery to prove that the University's regulations were applied against him arbitrarily. Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment shall be granted if the record shows that ""there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law."" It is clear that the party moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact. Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d 292, 296 (7th Cir. 1983); Rose v. Bridgeport Brass Co., 487 F.2d 804 (7th Cir. 1973). ""For the purpose of determining whether any material fact remains disputed 'the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts ... must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.' "" Fitzsimmons v. Best, 528 F.2d 692, 694 (7th Cir. 1976) (quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S. Ct. 993, 994, 8 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1962)). These inferences must, however, be reasonably drawn. Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d 102, 104 (7th Cir. 1983). ""To create a question of fact, an adverse party responding to a properly made and supported summary judgment motion must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.... A party may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleadings; similarly, a bare contention that an issue of fact exists is insufficient to raise a factual issue."" Id. at 105 (citations omitted). The existence of a factual dispute does not necessarily preclude summary judgment unless ""the disputed fact is outcome determinative under the governing law."" Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d  at 296. ""A material issue of fact is one that affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth."" Admiralty Fund v. Hugh Johnson & Co., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir. 1982). It is against this procedural background regarding the propriety of summary judgment that we must examine Dr. Korf's claims concerning the existence of material issues of fact relevant to his constitutional claims. Dr. Korf argues that the record contains issues of material fact as to ""whether he could have had adequate notice"" of Ball State's ""asserted prohibition of consensual sexual relations between faculty members and students."" Dr. Korf does not contend he was unaware of the University's proscription of unethical faculty conduct; rather, he argues that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics could not be reasonably interpreted to include what he labels ""consensual sexual relationships"" with students but which the Hearing Committee expressly found to be ""unethical behavior of exploiting students for his private advantage."" In support of his opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion, Dr. Korf failed to allege any specific facts which would tend to create a genuine issue challenging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics, paragraph 2, by his faculty peers on the Hearing Committee. While Dr. Korf argues that he was not ""adequately put on notice"" because he was the first Ball State University faculty member ever disciplined for conduct such as his or, for that matter, any unethical conduct, the only logical basis for this argument is that if another professor had previously been dismissed for conduct similar to his, Dr. Korf would have definitely known that his conduct would warrant discipline. The plaintiff-appellant has failed to cite any caselaw setting forth a constitutional requirement that such notice be provided to would-be offenders. Common sense, reason and good judgment should have made him cognizant of the fact that his conduct could and would be cause for termination. One cannot be heard to complain that it is somehow unfair to be the first one disciplined under a particular law, rule or regulation since if that were the case, no new law, rule or regulation could ever be enforced. Dr. Korf also alleges that other ""private and consensual"" faculty/student sexual relationships had occurred and were presently occurring at Ball State University and that no steps had ever been taken against the faculty members allegedly involved. This argument also misses the mark. First, despite Dr. Korf's repeated characterization of his conduct as ""private and consensual,"" the faculty Hearing Committee found that he engaged in unethical behavior by ""exploiting students for his private advantage."" Therefore, ""consensual"" sexual activity is not at issue as it does not concern a fact which is ""outcome determinative under the governing law."" Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d  at 296. In any event, while there is no evidence that the young student Dr. Korf admitted having a sexual relationship with did not consent to engage in sexual activity with him, Dr. Korf's conduct is not to be viewed in the same context as would conduct of an ordinary ""person on the street."" Rather, it must be judged in the context of the relationship existing between a professor and his students within an academic environment. University professors occupy an important place in our society and have concommitant ethical obligations. The AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics makes this clear: ""1.) The professor, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognizes the special responsibilities placed upon him.... ""2.) ... He demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor...."" Ball State University Faculty Handbook at II-7. Furthermore, the Committee heard evidence of Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards seven students who refused his advances. One student recounted how he had to be ""very assertive to get away from Dr. Korf's amorous advances."" Such conduct certainly cannot be characterized as consensual sexual activity. Second, even if such alleged relationships between other faculty and students were relevant, all Dr. Korf has done is make bare assertions of faculty-student sexual relationships without any detailed information, much less supporting affidavits or proof. He must set forth specific facts in order to create a genuine issue of fact. Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d  at 105. Dr. Korf further argues that it is significant that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics relied upon by the Board of Trustees as the basis for his termination does not make any reference to sexual conduct. While his observation that the statement does not specifically mention sexual conduct is correct,  his conclusion regarding the omission's significance is misplaced and is contrary to reason and common sense. As is the case with other laws, codes and regulations governing conduct, it is unreasonable to assume that the drafters of the Statement on Professional Ethics could and must specifically delineate each and every type of conduct (including deviant conduct) constituting a violation. Nor have we been cited any case reciting that the language of the Constitution requires such precision. "" [I]t is not feasible or necessary ... to spell out in detail all that conduct which will result in retaliation. The most conscientious of codes that define prohibited conduct of employees include 'catchall' clauses prohibiting employee 'misconduct,' 'immorality,' or 'conduct unbecoming.' "" Meehan v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822, 835 (D.C. Cir. 1968); modified, 425 F.2d 469 (D.C. Cir. 1969); aff'd en banc, 425 F.2d 472 (D.C. Cir. 1969). See also Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 158-162, 94 S. Ct. 1633, 1646-1648, 40 L. Ed. 2d 15 (1974) (statute authorizing removal or suspension of federal employees ""for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service"" is not vague or overbroad). The lack of specific reference to sexual conduct in the Statement on Professional Ethics does not bar its application to Dr. Korf's conduct. The Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees relied upon that portion of the AAUP Statement warning against ""any exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" in reaching their decision to terminate Dr. Korf. Dr. Korf argues that this portion of the statement only prohibits the use of student research or assistance in an improper manner because this portion of the statement ends by stating ""and acknowledges significant academic assistance from them."" Construing ""exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" to include Dr. Korf's conduct was entirely reasonable. The narrow construction Dr. Korf asks us to accept is contrary to the express language of the provision as it proscribes ""any exploitation of students"" rather than merely ""academic exploitation of students."" We agree with his academic peers on the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees in their application of this provision of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics to Dr. Korf's conduct. They were well-qualified to interpret the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as well as to determine what is and is not acceptable faculty conduct within an academic setting. Furthermore, while the Hearing Committee based their initial recommendation on the particular portion of the AAUP Statement barring ""exploitation of students ... for private advantage,"" they explained that they changed their recommendation after they undertook a ""close re-examination of the Statement of Ethics in the Faculty Handbook."" The pertinent paragraph of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics also states that a professor ""demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor."" It is patently clear that Dr. Korf's conduct was also inconsistent with this provision of the AAUP Statement. In sum, Dr. Korf's arguments merely consist of generalized allegations disparaging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement by the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees. Our examination of the record reveals no ""genuine issue of material fact"" precluding disposition of his substantive due process claim by summary judgment. When the record is viewed in the light most favorable to Dr. Korf, his bald allegations do not meet that standard of proof necessary to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he ""had adequate notice of the standard of conduct to which he was being held."" The facts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that he should have understood both the standards to which he was being held and the consequences of his conduct. Dr. Korf merely asserts that he was not afforded notice and thereby contends that an issue of fact exists. This assertion alone is ""insufficient to raise a factual issue."" Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d  at 105. Because of Dr. Korf's failure to allege any specific facts in support of his alleged lack of notice his substantive due process claim was ripe for summary judgment since ""there [was] no genuine issue as to any material fact ...."" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c). We also agree with the conclusions of law reached by the district court regarding the substantive due process issue and the court's express finding that ""it cannot be seriously maintained that Dr. Korf's conduct was not clearly proscribed by University Regulations."" ""The claim that a person is entitled to 'substantive due process' means, as we understand the concept, that state action which deprives him of life, liberty, or property must have a rational basis--that is to say, the reason for the deprivation may not be so inadequate that the judiciary will characterize it as 'arbitrary.' "" Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, 492 F.2d 1, 3-4 (7th Cir. 1974). We have no difficulty whatsoever concluding that Dr. Korf's termination was not ""arbitrary"" since the reasons for his termination were adequate. The University's interpretation of the AAUP Statement was entirely reasonable and rationally related to the duty of the University to provide a proper academic environment. "" [A] University has a right, and indeed a duty, to take all reasonable and lawful measures to prevent activities which adversely intrude into the teaching process or which might adversely affect the University's image and reputation. It has a right to expect and demand the highest standards of personal behavior and teaching performance from its teachers and professors. It does not have to settle for less."" Naragon v. Wharton, 572 F. Supp. 1117, 1121 (M.D. La. 1983). (A university did not violate the constitutional rights of a graduate assistant when it changed her assignment from teaching to research after discovering that she had had a homosexual relationship with a student who was not in her classes.) We hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Dr. Korf's substantive due process claim. Dr. Korf's allegations contending that disputed issues of material fact exist which should have precluded summary judgment on his equal protection claim suffer the same infirmities as his allegations regarding his substantive due process claim. Simply put, his allegations when viewed in a light most favorable to him, do not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the University selectively enforced its regulations against him. Dr. Korf again incorrectly premises his arguments on involvement in ""consensual sexual relations"" and merely alleges selective enforcement without providing us with any specific facts to support that claim. We do not agree with Dr. Korf's argument that he was terminated for his untraditional sexual preferences, since he was in fact terminated for his unethical conduct in violation of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as a result of sexual advances toward his students. The record fails to even suggest that the University would hesitate to discharge a professor who acted in a manner similar to Dr. Korf but directed his or her advances towards students of the opposite sex rather than the same sex. Since Dr. Korf, ""neither asserted nor established the existence of any suspect classification or the deprivation of any fundamental constitutional right ... the only inquiry is whether the State's [action] is 'rationally related to the State's objective.' "" Harrah Independent School Dist. v. Martin, 440 U.S. 194, 199, 99 S. Ct. 1062, 1064, 59 L. Ed. 2d 248 (1979) (citation omitted, quoting Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 315, 96 S. Ct. 2562, 2568, 49 L. Ed. 2d 520 (1976)). Clearly, Ball State University's action in this instance was rationally related to its responsibility to establish and maintain high ethical standards within the University in order to maintain a proper academic environment. In this case we do not see any evidence of the ""intentional invidious discrimination by the state against persons similarly situated"" which the Equal Protection Clause exists to protect. Ciechon v. City of Chicago, 686 F.2d 511, 522-23 (7th Cir. 1982). We hold that Dr. Korf's equal protection claim has no legal or factual basis and that the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on this claim. Finally, Dr. Korf maintains that even if he did not present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to his equal protection claim, the district court abused its discretion in denying his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) motion for further discovery before responding to the University's motion for summary judgment.  Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure envisions a situation such as this where summary judgment is sought prior to the initiation of discovery.  ""Subsection (f) allows a party who 'has no specific material contradicting his adversary's presentation to survive a summary judgment motion if he presents valid reasons justifying his failure of proof.' "" Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., Inc., 703 F.2d 525, 527 (11th Cir. 1983) (quoting 10-A Wright, Miller, & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2740 at 530 (2d ed. 1983)). In Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, 582 F.2d 1068 (7th Cir. 1978), our court quoted with approval the Eighth Circuit's reasoning on the showing required for a party to succeed in a Rule 56(f) motion: ""Rule 56(f) is not a shield that can be raised to block a motion for summary judgment without even the slightest showing by the opposing party that his opposition is meritorious. A party invoking its protections must do so in good faith by affirmatively demonstrating why he cannot respond to a movant's affidavits ... and how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact."" Id. at 1071 (emphasis added) (quoting Willmar Poultry Co. v. Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., 520 F.2d 289, 297 (8th Cir. 1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 915, 96 S. Ct. 1116, 47 L. Ed. 2d 320 (1976)). See also S.E.C. v. Spence & Green Chemical Co., 612 F.2d 896 (5th Cir. 1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1082, 101 S. Ct. 866, 66 L. Ed. 2d 806 (1981); Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., Inc., 703 F.2d  at 527; Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2740 at 530. In his affidavit to the district court, Dr. Korf alleged that due to his lack of time to conduct discovery he was unable to set forth any specific facts to demonstrate that genuine issues for trial existed. He sought to commence discovery concerning: (1) "" [R]elevant University policy and practice with respect to the proper scope of University inquiry into the private sexual relationships of faculty members. (2) "" [W]hether the University has singled out plaintiff, charged with engaging in private and consensual homosexual relationships with University students, for harsher treatment than faculty members who have engaged in heterosexual relationships with University students."" These foregoing reasons for which Dr. Korf sought discovery are insufficient to warrant the provision of additional time to conduct discovery before responding to the University's summary judgment motion. If his allegations were true he certainly had ample time to allege sufficient specific facts and/or conduct. He failed to provide an adequate explanation to the court as to ""why he [could not] respond to [the University's] affidavits ...."" Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, 582 F.2d  at 1071. Furthermore, both of the reasons he sets forth in seeking discovery related to ""private sexual relationships."" Since the discharge of Dr. Korf was not predicated upon his engaging in ""private sexual relationships,"" but unethical conduct by exploiting students for his private advantage, such discovery is completely irrelevant to his equal protection claim and would amount to no more than a fishing expedition. The information sought by Dr. Korf would be of no value to him in rebutting the strong showing made by Ball State University that Dr. Korf was properly terminated from his tenured professor position at the University. The Supreme Court has recently reiterated that unnecessary, broad-ranging discovery is disruptive and that as a consequence insubstantial claims should be resolved by summary judgment. Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817-18, 102 S. Ct. 2727, 2738-39, 73 L. Ed. 2d 396 (1982). This language clearly applies to this appeal and we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dr. Korf's motion to conduct additional discovery. The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.

1
Dr. William E. Korf appeals the district court's decision granting summary judgment to the defendants in an action brought by Dr. Korf following his termination as a tenured Associate Professor of Music History and Musicology at Ball State University, Muncie, Indiana.  On appeal Dr. Korf argues that the entry of summary judgment was an improper denial of his due process and equal protection claims, and his challenge to the defendants' qualified immunity.  Dr. Korf also argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying him the opportunity to conduct further discovery and in holding that the Eleventh Amendment provides defendants with immunity from prospective and injunctive relief.  We AFFIRM.

I.

2
In February, 1981, Dr. Korf was informed by Lloyd Nelson, Dean of Ball State's College of Fine and Applied Arts, that certain of his current and former male students had accused him of sexual harassment.  The students alleged that the harassment consisted of Dr. Korf's making unwelcomed sexual advances towards them and offering good grades contingent upon sexual involvement.  Dean Nelson informed Dr. Korf that he intended to commence termination proceedings against him, and provided him the opportunity to resign.  Dr. Korf denied the accusations and refused to resign.  In accordance with established procedures, a committee was formed to investigate the charges.  On April 2, 1981, the committee concluded that sufficient grounds existed to institute formal termination proceedings against Dr. Korf.


3
The president of Ball State, Dr. Robert P. Bell, reviewed the committee's recommendation and informed Dr. Korf of the committee's findings.  Based on those findings, on April 24, 1981, Dr. Bell told Dr. Korf that formal termination proceedings were being commenced and that he had the right to a hearing before an  hoc hearing committee, drawn from the University Senate Judicial Committee, to determine whether or not Dr. Korf should be removed from his position.  Dr. Korf requested a hearing and the University complied with his request on May 20, 1981.


4
At that hearing, a student related the relationship he had had with Dr. Korf and testified that Dr. Korf gave him money and gifts in exchange for sexual acts.   In addition, the student alleged that he was promised good grades.  While denying that grades were involved, Dr. Korf admitted his sexual involvement with this student.  The committee also heard testimony from three individuals and had statements of four other individuals who recounted Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards them while or after they were his students.


5
On May 21, 1981, the committee made the following findings:


6
""Based on the evidence provided at the hearing on May 20, 1981, we find Dr. William E. Korf guilty of unethical conduct because he used his position and influence as a teacher to exploit students for his private advantage.  The evidence indicates a pattern of behavior in which he frequently built a personal, friendly relationship, followed by sexual advances, often in his home.


7
""This pattern was evidenced by the testimony of six (6) witnesses who were either present or submitted signed statements ... and by two (2) individuals who made statements to the Affirmative Action Officer ....  These eight (8) people are current or former students in one or more of Dr. Korf's classes.


8
""We find insufficient evidence to support the allegation that Dr. Korf encouraged dishonest academic conduct.""


9
The committee based its finding that Dr. Korf engaged in unethical conduct on paragraph 2 of the American Association of University Professors (""AAUP"") Statement on Professional Ethics which was adopted by Ball State University in 1967 and published in its Faculty Handbook.   Even though the committee found Dr. Korf guilty of unethical conduct, they recommended only that Dr. Korf be placed on a three-year period of probation, rather than discharged, because they did not feel that he had been provided ""ample warning and opportunity for behavioral change.""


10
Pursuant to established procedures, the Board of Trustees was presented with the hearing committee's report.  After hearing arguments from University representatives and counsel for Dr. Korf on July 6, 1981, the Trustees agreed with the committee's finding of unethical conduct but refused to accept the committee's disciplinary recommendation of three years probation and directed that the committee's report and recommendations be returned to them for reconsideration.  Upon reconsideration, the hearing committee, after a ""close re-examination of the statement of ethics in the Faculty Handbook "" and because of the realistic unenforceability of some of the proposed conditions of probation, reversed its prior recommendation of probation and recommended that Dr. Korf be discharged from the University.  Based upon this recommendation the Trustees terminated Dr. Korf's employment on July 24, 1981.


11
Dr. Korf initiated this action under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on May 21, 1982, seeking both legal and equitable relief.  The six-count complaint alleged violations of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights to substantive and procedural due process, equal protection, free speech, freedom of association, and privacy, along with state law claims for breach of his employment contract and infliction of emotional distress.  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss alleging that:  (1) they possessed immunity both under the Eleventh Amendment and the doctrine of qualified immunity;  (2) none of Dr. Korf's constitutional rights were violated;  and (3) Dr. Korf's employment contract was not breached and his emotional distress claim was insufficient.  The motion was accompanied by an affidavit from the President of the Ball State University Board of Trustees delineating the basis for Dr. Korf's termination.  Attached to the affidavit was the transcript of the formal hearing and all the exhibits presented.  On August 5, 1982, Dr. Korf moved for a continuance to allow him to respond to the defendants' motion to dismiss until after discovery.  Alternatively, he moved for an enlargement of time to respond to the defendants' motion.  The court granted his alternative motion.


12
On March 11, 1983 the district court granted defendants summary judgment on Dr. Korf's constitutional and state law claims.   The court concluded that Ball State University was an instrumentality of the State of Indiana for the purposes of the Eleventh Amendment and therefore the University, its Board of Trustees and the individual defendants in their official capacities were immune from suit under Sec. 1983.  Because the affidavits presented on Dr. Korf's behalf failed to provide any evidence sufficient to create a genuine question whether the individual defendants acted in bad faith, the court also ruled that the defendants were immune from Sec. 1983 liability under the doctrine of qualified or ""good faith"" immunity.


13
The main question we must decide is whether or not the district court committed error in granting the defendants' motion for summary judgment.  Dr. Korf contends that since there were disputed issues of material fact concerning his substantive due process and equal protection claims, summary judgment was improper.  Dr. Korf also argues that even if he has not created genuine issues of material fact regarding these constitutional claims, the trial court erred by failing to grant him sufficient time to conduct the necessary discovery to prove that the University's regulations were applied against him arbitrarily.

II.

14
Rule 56 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that summary judgment shall be granted if the record shows that ""there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.""    It is clear that the party moving for summary judgment has the burden of establishing that there is no genuine issue of material fact.    Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d 292, 296 (7th Cir.1983);  Rose v. Bridgeport Brass Co., 487 F.2d 804 (7th Cir.1973).  ""For the purpose of determining whether any material fact remains disputed 'the inferences to be drawn from the underlying facts ... must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.' ""    Fitzsimmons v. Best, 528 F.2d 692, 694 (7th Cir.1976) (quoting United States v. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655, 82 S.Ct. 993, 994, 8 L.Ed.2d 176 (1962)).  These inferences must, however, be reasonably drawn.    Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d 102, 104 (7th Cir.1983).


15
""To create a question of fact, an adverse party responding to a properly made and supported summary judgment motion must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial....  A party may not rest on mere allegations or denials of his pleadings;  similarly, a bare contention that an issue of fact exists is insufficient to raise a factual issue.""


16
Id. at 105 (citations omitted).  The existence of a factual dispute does not necessarily preclude summary judgment unless ""the disputed fact is outcome determinative under the governing law.""    Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d at 296.  ""A material issue of fact is one that affects the outcome of the litigation and requires a trial to resolve the parties' differing versions of the truth.""    Admiralty Fund v. Hugh Johnson & Co., 677 F.2d 1301, 1306 (9th Cir.1982).  It is against this procedural background regarding the propriety of summary judgment that we must examine Dr. Korf's claims concerning the existence of material issues of fact relevant to his constitutional claims.

III.
A. SUBSTANTIVE DUE PROCESS

17
Dr. Korf argues that the record contains issues of material fact as to ""whether he could have had adequate notice"" of Ball State's ""asserted prohibition of consensual sexual relations between faculty members and students.""    Dr. Korf does not contend he was unaware of the University's proscription of unethical faculty conduct;  rather, he argues that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics could not be reasonably interpreted to include what he labels ""consensual sexual relationships"" with students but which the Hearing Committee expressly found to be ""unethical behavior of exploiting students for his private advantage.""


18
In support of his opposition to defendants' summary judgment motion, Dr. Korf failed to allege any specific facts which would tend to create a genuine issue challenging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics, paragraph 2, by his faculty peers on the Hearing Committee.  While Dr. Korf argues that he was not ""adequately put on notice"" because he was the first Ball State University faculty member ever disciplined for conduct such as his or, for that matter, any unethical conduct, the only logical basis for this argument is that if another professor had previously been dismissed for conduct similar to his, Dr. Korf would have definitely known that his conduct would warrant discipline.  The plaintiff-appellant has failed to cite any caselaw setting forth a constitutional requirement that such notice be provided to would-be offenders.  Common sense, reason and good judgment should have made him cognizant of the fact that his conduct could and would be cause for termination.  One cannot be heard to complain that it is somehow unfair to be the first one disciplined under a particular law, rule or regulation since if that were the case, no new law, rule or regulation could ever be enforced.


19
Dr. Korf also alleges that other ""private and consensual"" faculty/student sexual relationships had occurred and were presently occurring at Ball State University and that no steps had ever been taken against the faculty members allegedly involved.  This argument also misses the mark.  First, despite Dr. Korf's repeated characterization of his conduct as ""private and consensual,"" the faculty Hearing Committee found that he engaged in unethical behavior by ""exploiting students for his private advantage.""    Therefore, ""consensual"" sexual activity is not at issue as it does not concern a fact which is ""outcome determinative under the governing law.""    Egger v. Phillips, 710 F.2d at 296.  In any event, while there is no evidence that the young student Dr. Korf admitted having a sexual relationship with did not consent to engage in sexual activity with him, Dr. Korf's conduct is not to be viewed in the same context as would conduct of an ordinary ""person on the street.""    Rather, it must be judged in the context of the relationship existing between a professor and his students within an academic environment.  University professors occupy an important place in our society and have concommitant ethical obligations.  The AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics makes this clear:


20
""1.) The professor, guided by a deep conviction of the worth and dignity of the advancement of knowledge, recognizes the special responsibilities placed upon him....


21
""2.) ... He demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor....""


22
Ball State University Faculty Handbook at II-7.  Furthermore, the Committee heard evidence of Dr. Korf's sexual advances towards seven students who refused his advances.  One student recounted how he had to be ""very assertive to get away from Dr. Korf's amorous advances.""    Such conduct certainly cannot be characterized as consensual sexual activity.  Second, even if such alleged relationships between other faculty and students were relevant, all Dr. Korf has done is make bare assertions of faculty-student sexual relationships without any detailed information, much less supporting affidavits or proof.  He must set forth specific facts in order to create a genuine issue of fact.    Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d at 105.


23
Dr. Korf further argues that it is significant that the AAUP Statement on Professional Ethics relied upon by the Board of Trustees as the basis for his termination does not make any reference to sexual conduct.  While his observation that the statement does not specifically mention sexual conduct is correct, his conclusion regarding the omission's significance is misplaced and is contrary to reason and common sense.  As is the case with other laws, codes and regulations governing conduct, it is unreasonable to assume that the drafters of the Statement on Professional Ethics could and must specifically delineate each and every type of conduct (including deviant conduct) constituting a violation.  Nor have we been cited any case reciting that the language of the Constitution requires such precision.


24
""[I]t is not feasible or necessary ... to spell out in detail all that conduct which will result in retaliation.  The most conscientious of codes that define prohibited conduct of employees include 'catchall' clauses prohibiting employee 'misconduct,' 'immorality,' or 'conduct unbecoming.' ""


25
Meehan v. Macy, 392 F.2d 822, 835 (D.C.Cir.1968);  modified, 425 F.2d 469 (D.C.Cir.1969);  aff'd en banc, 425 F.2d 472 (D.C.Cir.1969).    See also Arnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 158-162, 94 S.Ct. 1633, 1646-1648, 40 L.Ed.2d 15 (1974) (statute authorizing removal or suspension of federal employees ""for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service"" is not vague or overbroad).  The lack of specific reference to sexual conduct in the Statement on Professional Ethics does not bar its application to Dr. Korf's conduct.


26
The Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees relied upon that portion of the AAUP Statement warning against ""any exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" in reaching their decision to terminate Dr. Korf.  Dr. Korf argues that this portion of the statement only prohibits the use of student research or assistance in an improper manner because this portion of the statement ends by stating ""and acknowledges significant academic assistance from them.""    Construing ""exploitation of students for ... private advantage"" to include Dr. Korf's conduct was entirely reasonable.  The narrow construction Dr. Korf asks us to accept is contrary to the express language of the provision as it proscribes ""any exploitation of students"" rather than merely ""academic exploitation of students.""    We agree with his academic peers on the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees in their application of this provision of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics to Dr. Korf's conduct.  They were well-qualified to interpret the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as well as to determine what is and is not acceptable faculty conduct within an academic setting.  Furthermore, while the Hearing Committee based their initial recommendation on the particular portion of the AAUP Statement barring ""exploitation of students ... for private advantage,"" they explained that they changed their recommendation after they undertook a ""close re-examination of the Statement of Ethics in the Faculty Handbook.""    The pertinent paragraph of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics also states that a professor ""demonstrates respect for the student as an individual and adheres to his proper role as intellectual guide and counselor.""    It is patently clear that Dr. Korf's conduct was also inconsistent with this provision of the AAUP Statement.


27
In sum, Dr. Korf's arguments merely consist of generalized allegations disparaging the reasonableness of the interpretation given to the AAUP Statement by the Hearing Committee and the Board of Trustees.  Our examination of the record reveals no ""genuine issue of material fact"" precluding disposition of his substantive due process claim by summary judgment.  When the record is viewed in the light most favorable to Dr. Korf, his bald allegations do not meet that standard of proof necessary to create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he ""had adequate notice of the standard of conduct to which he was being held.""    The facts and circumstances clearly demonstrate that he should have understood both the standards to which he was being held and the consequences of his conduct.  Dr. Korf merely asserts that he was not afforded notice and thereby contends that an issue of fact exists.  This assertion alone is ""insufficient to raise a factual issue.""    Posey v. Skyline Corp., 702 F.2d at 105.  Because of Dr. Korf's failure to allege any specific facts in support of his alleged lack of notice his substantive due process claim was ripe for summary judgment since ""there [was] no genuine issue as to any material fact ....""  Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).


28
We also agree with the conclusions of law reached by the district court regarding the substantive due process issue and the court's express finding that ""it cannot be seriously maintained that Dr. Korf's conduct was not clearly proscribed by University Regulations.""


29
""The claim that a person is entitled to 'substantive due process' means, as we understand the concept, that state action which deprives him of life, liberty, or property must have a rational basis--that is to say, the reason for the deprivation may not be so inadequate that the judiciary will characterize it as 'arbitrary.' ""


30
Jeffries v. Turkey Run Consolidated School District, 492 F.2d 1, 3-4 (7th Cir.1974).  We have no difficulty whatsoever concluding that Dr. Korf's termination was not ""arbitrary"" since the reasons for his termination were adequate.  The University's interpretation of the AAUP Statement was entirely reasonable and rationally related to the duty of the University to provide a proper academic environment.


31
""[A] University has a right, and indeed a duty, to take all reasonable and lawful measures to prevent activities which adversely intrude into the teaching process or which might adversely affect the University's image and reputation.  It has a right to expect and demand the highest standards of personal behavior and teaching performance from its teachers and professors.  It does not have to settle for less.""


32
Naragon v. Wharton, 572 F.Supp. 1117, 1121 (M.D.La.1983).  (A university did not violate the constitutional rights of a graduate assistant when it changed her assignment from teaching to research after discovering that she had had a homosexual relationship with a student who was not in her classes.)    We hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on Dr. Korf's substantive due process claim.

B. EQUAL PROTECTION

33
Dr. Korf's allegations contending that disputed issues of material fact exist which should have precluded summary judgment on his equal protection claim suffer the same infirmities as his allegations regarding his substantive due process claim.  Simply put, his allegations when viewed in a light most favorable to him, do not create a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the University selectively enforced its regulations against him.  Dr. Korf again incorrectly premises his arguments on involvement in ""consensual sexual relations"" and merely alleges selective enforcement without providing us with any specific facts to support that claim.


34
We do not agree with Dr. Korf's argument that he was terminated for his untraditional sexual preferences, since he was in fact terminated for his unethical conduct in violation of the AAUP Statement of Professional Ethics as a result of sexual advances toward his students.  The record fails to even suggest that the University would hesitate to discharge a professor who acted in a manner similar to Dr. Korf but directed his or her advances towards students of the opposite sex rather than the same sex.  Since Dr. Korf,


35
""neither asserted nor established the existence of any suspect classification or the deprivation of any fundamental constitutional right ... the only inquiry is whether the State's [action] is 'rationally related to the State's objective.' ""


36
Harrah Independent School Dist. v. Martin, 440 U.S. 194, 199, 99 S.Ct. 1062, 1064, 59 L.Ed.2d 248 (1979) (citation omitted, quoting Massachusetts Bd. of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 315, 96 S.Ct. 2562, 2568, 49 L.Ed.2d 520 (1976)).  Clearly, Ball State University's action in this instance was rationally related to its responsibility to establish and maintain high ethical standards within the University in order to maintain a proper academic environment.  In this case we do not see any evidence of the ""intentional invidious discrimination by the state against persons similarly situated"" which the Equal Protection Clause exists to protect.    Ciechon v. City of Chicago, 686 F.2d 511, 522-23 (7th Cir.1982).  We hold that Dr. Korf's equal protection claim has no legal or factual basis and that the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendants on this claim.

IV.

37
Finally, Dr. Korf maintains that even if he did not present sufficient evidence to create a genuine issue of material fact with regard to his equal protection claim, the district court abused its discretion in denying his Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(f) motion for further discovery before responding to the University's motion for summary judgment.   Rule 56(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure envisions a situation such as this where summary judgment is sought prior to the initiation of discovery.


38
""Subsection (f) allows a party who 'has no specific material contradicting his adversary's presentation to survive a summary judgment motion if he presents valid reasons justifying his failure of proof.' ""


39
Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., Inc., 703 F.2d 525, 527 (11th Cir.1983) (quoting 10-A Wright, Miller, & Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2740 at 530 (2d ed. 1983)).


40
In Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, 582 F.2d 1068 (7th Cir.1978), our court quoted with approval the Eighth Circuit's reasoning on the showing required for a party to succeed in a Rule 56(f) motion:


41
""Rule 56(f) is not a shield that can be raised to block a motion for summary judgment without even the slightest showing by the opposing party that his opposition is meritorious.  A party invoking its protections must do so in good faith by affirmatively demonstrating why he cannot respond to a movant's affidavits ... and how postponement of a ruling on the motion will enable him, by discovery or other means, to rebut the movant's showing of the absence of a genuine issue of fact.""


42
Id. at 1071 (emphasis added) (quoting Willmar Poultry Co. v. Morton-Norwich Products, Inc., 520 F.2d 289, 297 (8th Cir.1975), cert. denied, 424 U.S. 915, 96 S.Ct. 1116, 47 L.Ed.2d 320 (1976)).    See also S.E.C. v. Spence & Green Chemical Co., 612 F.2d 896 (5th Cir.1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S. 1082, 101 S.Ct. 866, 66 L.Ed.2d 806 (1981);  Wallace v. Brownell Pontiac-GMC Co., Inc., 703 F.2d at 527;  Federal Practice and Procedure Sec. 2740 at 530.


43
In his affidavit to the district court, Dr. Korf alleged that due to his lack of time to conduct discovery he was unable to set forth any specific facts to demonstrate that genuine issues for trial existed.  He sought to commence discovery concerning:


44
(1) ""[R]elevant University policy and practice with respect to the proper scope of University inquiry into the private sexual relationships of faculty members.


45
(2) ""[W]hether the University has singled out plaintiff, charged with engaging in private and consensual homosexual relationships with University students, for harsher treatment than faculty members who have engaged in heterosexual relationships with University students.""


46
These foregoing reasons for which Dr. Korf sought discovery are insufficient to warrant the provision of additional time to conduct discovery before responding to the University's summary judgment motion.  If his allegations were true he certainly had ample time to allege sufficient specific facts and/or conduct.  He failed to provide an adequate explanation to the court as to ""why he [could not] respond to [the University's] affidavits ....""  Lamb's Patio Theatre v. Universal Film Exchanges, 582 F.2d at 1071.  Furthermore, both of the reasons he sets forth in seeking discovery related to ""private sexual relationships.""    Since the discharge of Dr. Korf was not predicated upon his engaging in ""private sexual relationships,"" but unethical conduct by exploiting students for his private advantage, such discovery is completely irrelevant to his equal protection claim and would amount to no more than a fishing expedition.  The information sought by Dr. Korf would be of no value to him in rebutting the strong showing made by Ball State University that Dr. Korf was properly terminated from his tenured professor position at the University.  The Supreme Court has recently reiterated that unnecessary, broad-ranging discovery is disruptive and that as a consequence insubstantial claims should be resolved by summary judgment.    Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 800, 817-18, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 2738-39, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982).  This language clearly applies to this appeal and we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Dr. Korf's motion to conduct additional discovery.


47
The decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.

http://www.upi.com/Archives/1991/10/11/A-Ball-State-University-instructor-accused-by-a-woman/4771687153600/,"
MUNCIE, Ind. --  A Ball State University instructor accused by a woman student of making sexual advances was found dead in his car, an apparent suicide.
 The instructor, Sheldon H. Gurney, 46, apparently used a jar with cyanide and hydrochloric acid from his biology laboratory to turn his car into a gas chamber Thursday, investigators said. Emergency crew used protective equipment to guard themselves from the fumes when they took him from his car parked behind his house.

An autopsy was planned Friday to determine the exact cause and approximate time of death, Delaware County Coroner Jack Stonebraker Jr. said.
 Gurney's death came just three days after one of the chief reporters for the student-written Ball State Daily News, Rebecca Ward of DeMotte, wrote a bylined article telling how an instructor had helpfully rubbed her back and then moved from helpfulness to sexual fondling.
 She did not name Gurney in the Monday article but did file a protective order for herself against him Oct. 2 in Delaware Superior Court. 
 Ward was unavailable for comment after Gurney's death. She left town Thursday for her northern Indiana home, campus friends said.

 University police were continuing a criminal investigation of allegations that Gurney had committed sexual battery, Ball State University Capt. Robert Fey said.
 Ward did not allege she was raped. She wrote that her instructor had massaged her back and then moved his hands to her breasts. She said she froze, not knowing what to do. She had respected the man as a professor and did not want to anger him but found an excuse to flee the room.
 Her article generated letters to editor in the student newspaper about sexual harassment for several days afterward.
 'As a consequence of the article that appeared in the student newspaper on Monday, at least four other students came forward and charged that they were victims of similar behavior,' Jeffrey Alford, executive director of communications and publications for the university, said Friday.

"
https://casetext.com/case/webb-v-board-of-trustees-of-ball-state-university,"  JOHN DANIEL TINDER, U.S. District Judge   On August 4, 1997, the Plaintiffs, Gary L. Webb, Susan L. Sayles and Melissa L. Wisner, commenced this action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Complaint alleged that Plaintiffs were subjected to sexual discrimination, harassment and retaliation, as well as violations of their Fourteenth Amendment and First Amendment rights. The Complaint also alleged that Defendants conspired to deny Plaintiffs' civil rights. Plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction which was denied by the court and affirmed on appeal. On January 5, 2000, the court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment in favor of all Defendants and against all Plaintiffs on all claims. The Seventh Circuit affirmed the grant of summary judgment in all respects. Thus, Defendants are prevailing parties in this litigation.   On January 31, 2000, Defendants filed their Petition For Attorneys' Fees And Motion For Sanctions, and on June 23, 2000, they filed their Verified And Amended Petition for Attorneys' Fees And Motion For Sanctions. Defendants seek an award of $103,629.33 in attorneys' fees or sanctions or some combination thereof against Plaintiffs Gary Webb and Melissa Wisner and their counsel, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k), 42 U.S.C. § 1988, and 28 U.S.C. § 1927.   Defendants originally sought attorney's fees against Plaintiff Susan Sayles, but have withdrawn their fee petition as against her and have reduced their original fee petition request of $155,444.00 by one-third, which they generously attribute to the defense of Plaintiff Sayles' claims. Because there was substantial overlap in the defense of the claims of the other Plaintiffs, however, less than one-third of the time expended was dedicated solely to Sayles' claims. Nevertheless, Defendants believed that the fairest approach was to reduce their fee petition by one-third.   Originally Defendants sought sanctions against counsel under Rule 11(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, but they have withdrawn that request.   I. Discussion A. Legal Standards In Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434 U.S. 412 (1978), the Supreme Court held that under 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-5(k)  ""a district court may in its discretion award attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant in a Title VII case upon a finding that the plaintiff's action was frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation, even though not brought in subjective bad faith."" Id. at 421; see also Monroe v. Children's Home Ass'n, 128 F.3d 591, 594 (7th Cir. 1997) (defendants in Title VII action can recover attorney's fees if plaintiff's claim is frivolous). If a district court finds that a plaintiff brought or continued to litigate a Title VII claim in bad faith, ""there will be an even stronger basis for charging him with the attorney's fees incurred by the defense."" Id. at 422. A decision to award attorney's fees under Section 2000e-5(k) is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. See Connolly v. Nat'l Sch. Bus Serv., Inc., 177 F.3d 593, 596-97.   In Hughes v. Rowe, 449 U.S. 5 (1980), the Supreme Court adopted the Christianburg standard for imposition of attorney's fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, which allows the court in its discretion to award reasonable attorney's fees to the prevailing party. Id. at 14-15. Prevailing plaintiffs are awarded attorney's fees as a matter of course, but prevailing defendants are to be awarded attorney's fees only if the plaintiff's claim was ""frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless."" Id. (quoting Christiansburg, 434 U.S. at 422); see also Khan v. Gallitano, 180 F.3d 829, 837 (7th Cir. 1999). A showing of bad faith is not a prerequisite to an award of attorney's fees under § 1988. Munson v. Milwaukee Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 969 F.2d 266, 269 (7th Cir. 1992). Rather, ""the defendant must demonstrate that the plaintiff's action is `meritless in the sense that it is groundless or without foundation.'"" Id. (quoting Hughes, 449 U.S. at 14). ""[W]hen a civil rights suit is lacking in any legal or factual basis . . ., an award of fees to the defendant is clearly appropriate to deter frivolous filings and to ensure that the ability of the courts to remedy civil rights violations is not restricted by dockets crowded with baseless litigation."" Id. (quotation omitted). The court may consider a plaintiff's ability to pay when deciding whether to award attorneys fees under § 1988. Munson v. Friske, 754 F.2d 683, 697 (7th Cir. 1985). Like a fee award under § 2000e-5(k), an award of fees under § 1988 to a prevailing defendant is reviewed for an abuse of discretion and, therefore, is upheld unless ""no reasonable person could take the view adopted by the trial court."" Id. (quotation omitted).    Section 1988 provides in relevant part: ""(b) In any action or proceeding to enforce . . . [ 42 U.S.C. § 1983] . . . the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . ., a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs."" 42 U.S.C. § 1988.   28 U.S.C. § 1927  authorizes the imposition of attorney's fees, costs and expenses against counsel who ""multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously."" Fin. Inv. Co. (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Geberit AG, 165 F.3d 526, 533 (7th Cir. 1998); see Kotsilieris v. Chalmers, 966 F.2d 1181, 1184 (7th Cir. 1992). Counsel acts unreasonably ""by engaging in a serious and studied disregard for the orderly process of justice,"" Walter v. Fiorenzo, 840 F.2d 427, 433 (7th Cir. 1988) (quotation omitted), or where a ""claim [is] without a plausible legal or factual basis and lacking in justification."" Id. (quotation omitted) (emphasis in Walter). ""In determining whether an attorney's actions were objectively unreasonable a court may infer intent from a total lack of factual or legal basis for a suit."" Id. ""`Vexatious' conduct involves either subjective or objective bad faith."" Pac. Dunlop Holdings, Inc. v. Barosh, 22 F.3d 113, 120 (7th Cir. 1994) (citing Kotsilieris, 966 F.2d at 1184). Extremely negligent conduct, like reckless and indifferent conduct satisfies the bad faith requirement. Id. (citing Kotsilieris, 966 F.2d at 1185). Pursing a path ""that a reasonably careful attorney would have known, after appropriate inquiry, to be unsound"" is objectively unreasonable and vexatious. Walter, 840 F.2d at 433-44. A district court may consider counsel's ability to pay when imposing § 1927 sanctions, but is not required to do so. See Fox Valley Const. Workers Fringe Ben. Funds v. Pride of Fox Masonry Expert Restorations, 140 F.3d 661, 667 (7th Cir. 1998). A decision to grant sanctions under § 1927 is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Fin. Inv. Co., 165 F.3d at 530.     The statute provides that: ""Any attorney . . . who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct. Id.   The Walter court upheld a sanctions award for filing meritless claims against a defendant stating, ""Where a party files a baseless claim, which cannot be supported after four years of discovery and which previously has been identified as baseless as against three other defendants, sanctions are indeed appropriate."" Id. at 436.   B. Background  The Complaint names the Board of Trustees of Ball State University and 49 individuals as Defendants individually and in their official capacities as employees or agents of Ball State University. Members of the Board were Frank A. Bracken, Mary Lou Conrad, Chad A. Davis, Jeffrey H. Smulyan, Krishna A. Thomas, Thomas L. DeWeese, Hollis E. Hughes, Jr., Richard L. Moake, James W. Parks, Gregory A. Schenkel and Pennie M. Thomas. John Worthen was President of Ball State University, Warren Vander Hill was Provost and Vice-President for Academic Affairs, Ronald Johnstone was Dean of the College of Sciences and Humanities (the ""College""), Donald Van Meter and William Eidson were Associate Deans of the College, and Jon Moll was legal counsel to the Board and its agents. Wynola Richards was the Director of Affirmative Action and Assistant Provost until July 1, 1995. Chris Airriess was a faculty member and chair of the Academic Freedom and Ethics Committee (""AFE Committee""). Tom Lowe, Ramon A. Avila, Carla Earhart, Robert Hayes, Ann Henderson, Kyama Kabadaki, Tim Lyon, Donald Merten, Leslie Milner, Jerome Ulman, Arthur Wilson, and Judy Yardon were faculty members or employees of the University and members of the AFE Committee.   Sali Falling was the BSU Director of Affirmative Action beginning with the 1995-96 academic year. Paul Parkison was a member of the faculty and chair of the  hoc committee appointed by President Worthen to address Plaintiff Webb's complaints. Other members of the  hoc committee were Kay E. Hodson, Sue H. Whitaker, and R. Thomas Wright. James Hendricks was a faculty member and chair of the Department of Criminal Justice and Criminology (the ""Department""). Jean Comley, Bryan Byers, Taiping Ho, and Michael F. Brown were faculty members of the Department. Norman Beck was the BSU Executive Director of Human Resources, Beverly Pitts was the Associate Provost, Joseph Wehner was the Director or Public Safety, and William McCune was the BSU controller. Alice Bennett was a faculty member and chair of the College's Promotion and Tenure Appeals Committee, Robert South was a faculty member and chair of the University Promotion and Tenure Committee. Terrance Aldridge was a BSU student and reporter for the BSU Daily News. Mike McCAuley was the BSU Director of Academic Systems.   Count I alleges Plaintiff Webb's cause of action for sexual harassment under Title VII against the Board. Count II alleges Webb's cause of action for retaliation under Title VII against the Board. Count III alleges Webb's Section 1983 claim premised upon violations of the Fourteenth and First Amendments against the Board and all individual Defendants with the exception of Defendant South. Count IV alleges a conspiracy to deny Webb's civil rights in violation of Section 1983 against all Defendants, again with the exception of Defendant South.   Count IX alleges Plaintiff Wisner's cause of action for sexual discrimination under Title VII against the Board. Count X alleges Wisner's cause of action for retaliation under Title VII against the Board. Count XI alleges her cause of action for denial of civil rights under Section 1983 against the Defendant Board and Defendants Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, Thomas, Worthen, Vander Hill, Johnstone, Moll, Falling, Hendricks, Comley, Byers, Ho, Brown, Beck, Wehner, and McCauley. Count XII alleges a conspiracy to violate Wisner's civil rights against these same Defendants.   C. Application  In general response to Defendants' petition for attorneys' fees, Plaintiffs argue that before filing the Complaint in this case, Plaintiffs' counsel heard Plaintiffs' recitation of the facts relating to their claims and was provided with voluminous records upon which to base their claims, all of which established that ""allegations of bad faith were reasonably made and that the complaint was not groundless in law or fact."" (Pls.' Resp. Defs.' Pet. Fees at 8.) But improper motive, if an element of Plaintiffs' claims, is only one element. A pre-filing inquiry which causes counsel to conclude that Plaintiffs have evidentiary support for only a single element of a claim or claims is not enough to warrant assertion of those claims in a legal action. A reasonable inquiry requires counsel to consider all elements of all claims and then determine that there likely is evidentiary support for all elements. Interestingly, though, Plaintiffs do not argue that counsel concluded that allegations respecting other elements of the claims asserted were reasonably made and grounded in fact. Furthermore, the representation that counsel based the allegations of the Complaint upon Plaintiffs' recitation of ""facts"" and voluminous records provided by them fails to reflect that counsel engaged in an adequate prefiling investigation into the applicable law.   Plaintiffs claim that they did not have the benefit of discovery and argue that Defendants would have resisted any efforts to be subjected to discovery since they asserted a qualified immunity defense. The latter is speculative. As to the former, though Plaintiffs may not have engaged in formal discovery recognized by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, they did have the benefit of discovery through the preliminary injunction hearing, and Plaintiffs' were allowed to supplement their responses to Defendants' dispositive motions following the conclusion of that hearing. Plaintiffs assert they assumed they were unable to take discovery before the May 4, 1998, decision in Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598 (1998) (dicta suggesting that courts in their discretion may permit discovery against official asserting qualified immunity defense), and by that time the district court had ordered a stay of the proceedings. Plaintiffs fail to acknowledge that the stay was entered upon Plaintiffs' motion seeking a stay of the proceedings pending disposition of their appeal of the court's ruling on their motion for preliminary injunction. In addition, the court stayed all proceedings except for pleadings seeking a dissolution of the stay. (Entry Granting Pls.' Mot. Stay Proceedings, 2/11/98 at 1.) Plaintiffs did not seek any relief from the stay during the pendency of their appeal; rather, they waited until the court of appeals affirmed this court's ruling and then waited over six months after that before moving to lift the stay.   Plaintiff Webb, along with Susan Sayles, filed their first suit against Ball State in 1997. Ball State removed the case to federal court where it was assigned Cause No. IP 97-0221-C-M/S. Plaintiffs moved to remand, Judge McKinney concluded that he likely had subject matter jurisdiction because the case raised a federal question, and Plaintiffs dismissed the case. Approximately six months later, Plaintiffs filed this action. Defendants argue that given Mr. Dowling's comments at the remand hearing to Judge McKinney that ""I have no interest in being in this Court. I don't want to be in this Court. I didn't ask for this Court because I want the state law to give me a remedy in this case"" (Defs.' App. Evid. Mats., Ex. B, Tr. at 25), the filing of this action later that same year arguably might have been a vexatious multiplication of proceedings. Defendants, however, cite no authority to support their argument. The court declines to sanction Plaintiffs for bringing a subsequent action after expressing a preference for a state forum for similar if not identical claims and issues.   1. Title VII Claims  Defendants contend the Title VII claims were inconsistent with the EEOC charges upon which they were based or lacking in any evidentiary support. Long before the Complaint was filed it was well-settled that a plaintiff could not bring Title VII claims not included in his or her EEOC Charge. See Cheek v. W. S. Life Ins. Co., 31 F.3d 497, 500 (7th Cir. 1994); Rush v. McDonald's Corp., 966 F.2d 1104, 1110 (7th Cir. 1992); Babrocky v. Jewel Food Co., 773 F.2d 857, 863 (7th Cir. 1985). Count I, ""Plaintiff Webb's Cause of Action for Sexual Harassment,"" asserted that Webb was subjected to sexual harassment. The sex discrimination box is checked on Webb's first EEOC charge, but the body of the charge contains no allegations pertaining to a sex discrimination or harassment claim. The Seventh Circuit has not addressed whether merely checking the box on the charge form without making particular allegations in the body of the charge suffices to include a claim within the scope of the EEOC charge. The court concluded that checking the box for ""sex"" discrimination alone does not suffice to bring a sexual harassment claim within the scope of the EEOC charge. However, given the absence of controlling precedent, the court finds that Webb's assertion of a sexual harassment claim is not sanctionable. Defendants also urge that Webb's sexual harassment claim ignored clear precedent that such a claim cannot be based upon an allegation arising from the ending of a consensual relationship, citing Huebschen v. Dep't of Health Soc. Servs., 716 F.2d 1167 (7th Cir. 1983). That decision, however was decided under the Equal Protection clause and therefore was not clearly binding precedent as the Defendants urge. The court does not find that the bringing of Webb's sexual harassment claim warrants sanctions.   Wisner's sex discrimination claim under Title VII is well beyond the scope of her EEOC charges, however. Plaintiffs argue that EEOC intake officers rather than they drafted the EEOC charges, implying that this should entitle them to an exception to the rule regarding the scope of an EEOC charge. No authority is offered to support this argument, which is nothing other than an attempt to shift the blame to the EEOC and will not be condoned. Given that Webb is highly educated with a Ph.D. and accumulated several credits in law school and Wisner has a college degree, as well as the fact that all Plaintiffs assisted each other in preparing their EEOC charges, the argument is frivolous and patently unreasonable given the Plaintiffs' high levels of education and coordinated efforts in preparing their EEOC charges. Therefore, Wisner's sex discrimination claim ignores the well-settled scope of the charge doctrine. It therefore is sanctionable under § 2000e-5(k).   Wisner's sex discrimination claim against the Board is subject to sanctions for another fundamental reason. The Complaint alleges that various Defendants took certain actions against her and the Board ""had knowledge of the facts alleged and acquiesced in the conduct of its employees and agents as described above."" (Id. ¶ 52.) ""A complaint which consists of conclusory allegations unsupported by factual assertions fails even the liberal standard of Rule 12(b)(6)."" Palda v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 47 F.3d 872, 875 (7th Cir. 1995); see Cushing v. City of Chicago, 3 F.3d 1156, 1167 (7th Cir. 1993). This allegation against the Board is vague, conclusory and unsupported by factual assertions. Wisner therefore fails to state a Title VII sex discrimination claim in the Complaint against the Board and, moreover, the bringing of this frivolous claim is sanctionable under § 2000e-5(k).   With respect to Webb's Title VII retaliation claim, Defendants argue that Webb ignored clear Seventh Circuit precedent that defined an adverse action ""as something substantially more than anything he claimed."" (Mem. Supp. Defs.' Pet. at 18.) Webb argued, however, that even if each alleged act on its own did not constitute an adverse action, all of the acts ""taken as a whole"" constituted an adverse action against him. The court concluded that even when taken as a whole, the acts about which Webb complained were not materially adverse actions. Nevertheless, his argument reasonably could be considered a nonfrivolous argument for the extension or a modification of the law.   Defendants argue that Webb's retaliation claim is sanctionable because it was clear he could not establish the necessary causal link between protected activity and the allegedly adverse employment actions. The claimed protected activity was the filing of an EEOC charge on September 21, 1995. (Compl., Ex. 2 at 1-2.) Webb's only ""evidence"" and argument for the causal link was the time period between the filing of the charge and the alleged retaliatory acts. (Pls.' Resp. Defs.' Mots. Dismiss Summ. J. at 39.) The earliest alleged adverse action occurred in December 1996; the others occurred even more remote in time. The passage of time between this earliest action-coming more than 14 months after the protected activity-was far greater than periods of time which the Seventh Circuit has held insufficient evidence of a causal link. See, e.g., Hughes v. Derwinski, 967 F.2d 1168, 1174-75 (7th Cir. 1992) (4 months insufficient); Juarez v. Ameritech Mobile Comm., Inc., 957 F.2d 317, 321 (7th Cir. 1992) (6 months insufficient). Plaintiffs did not provide any arguments as to why a much lengthier time period should be able to raise an inference of a causal link, rather than serve as counter-evidence of causation. Had they and counsel done their homework before filing suit, they would have known that the remoteness of the alleged adverse acts to the protected activity alone could not support the causation element of a retaliation claim. Further, once this was brought to their attention through Defendants' dispositive motions, Plaintiffs should have conceded the lack of a plausible legal basis for Webb's retaliation claim and dismissed it. They did not do so, forcing the court to address the claim in its entry and thus justifying imposition of sanctions under § 2000e-5(k).   As for Wisner's retaliation claim, the court concluded that a retaliation claim stemming from her transfer was within the scope of her third EEOC charge and that her transfer was arguably an adverse action. The court ultimately concluded that Plaintiffs failed to come forward with sufficient evidence that she suffered a materially adverse employment action because they failed to prove that her transfer was something other than a lateral transfer and that she had the same level of material responsibility. But Plaintiffs offered evidence that in her new position Wisner lacked a supervisory position over students which she had in her administrative position in the Department. Thus, it cannot be said that Wisner's retaliation claim based on her transfer was frivolous, unreasonable or without foundation even though Defendants were entitled to summary judgment on that claim.   Defendants contend Plaintiffs should be sanctioned for naming 49 Defendants in their individual capacity without alleging or offering any facts to support individual capacity claims. Defendants also contend that most of the Defendants, though they do not specifically identify them by name, never took any action against Plaintiffs but rather served on committees or boards that did not do what Plaintiffs wanted. Suit against public officials in their individual capacities ""can be abusive, in some cases, and, where appropriate, [can] subject plaintiffs and their counsel to sanctions . . . especially where such defendants are forced to hire separate counsel in their individual capacity or are subjected, as individuals, to vexatious litigation."" Scott v. Flowers, 910 F.2d 201, 213 n. 25 (5th Cir. 1990); see also Latimore v. Citibank Fed. Sav. Bank, 151 F.3d 712, 716 (7th Cir. 1998) (warning that ""this court does not look with favor on the promiscuous joinder of minor employees as defendants in cases against their employers.""); Anderson v. County of Montgomery, 111 F.3d 494, 502 (7th Cir. 1997) (affirming sanctions for dragging a number of defendants into suit without legal or factual merit), overruled on other grounds by DeWalt v. Carter, 224 F.3d 607 (7th Cir. 2000). But none of the defendants sued in their individual capacities, save Richards, hired separate counsel to defend against the individual capacity claims, which may weigh against finding that the claims against them in their individual capacities was abusive, see, Scott, 910 F.2d at 213 n. 25.    Defendants would have better assisted the court in considering their petition had they named those Defendants.   Defendants argue that the naming as Defendants the members of the AFE Committee (Defendants Airriess, Loew, Avila, Earhart, Hayes, Henderson, Kabadaki, Lyon, Merten, Milner, Ulman, Wilson and Yardon), the  hoc committee (Defendants Parkison, Hodson, Whitaker and Wright), University Controller McCune, campus police chief Wehner, and University attorney Moll was purely to harass and intimidate the Ball State administration. The only actions the AFE Committee took against Webb was to investigate Cotlar's complaint against him, find in Cotlar's favor and recommend that Webb be reprimanded. The Provost, however overruled that recommendation and Webb was not reprimanded. Thus, Webb failed to allege or prove the denial of any property interest by the AFE Committee. As for the  hoc committee, which President Worthen appointed to investigate the concerns raised in Webb's manifesto, that committee interviewed Webb and other witnesses and then issued a report containing three possible solutions, including Webb's removal as Department Chair. Webb did not lose his position as Chair as a result of the  hoc committee's recommendations. Thus, Webb failed to allege or prove the denial of any property interest by the  hoc committee. The court concludes that Webb's § 1983 claims against the AFE Committee and the  hoc committee premised upon an alleged denial of a due process property right warrant sanctions under § 1988 because they are frivolous, unreasonable and lacking in any legal or factual basis.   Plaintiffs did move to dismiss Defendant McCune after the filing of Defendants' motion to dismiss and motion for summary judgment, as they should have. (Pls.' Suppl. Resp. Defs.' Mots. Dismiss Summ. J. Mem. Supp. at 14.) In light of this, the court declines to sanction them for bringing claims against McCune.   As for Defendant Wehner, Webb alleged that he received parking tickets from campus police officers ""supervised by defendant WEHNER"" ""for parking in a parking lot . . . at which [he] had authorization to park."" (Compl. ¶ 35(F).) He also alleged that Wisner contacted agents of Wehner, explained the facts and was told that the tickets were removed (id.), and that ""Defendant WEHNER, with knowledge of these facts, intentionally and in bad faith refused to remedy the situation, causing plaintiff to be financially liable without just cause and without due process[.]"" (Id.) Similarly, Wisner alleged that she received unjustified parking tickets from the BSU Department of Public Safety ""under the supervision of defendant WEHNER"" for parking in a lot for which she had a permit, which was ""on information and belief, known to and acquiesced in, by defendant WEHNER."" Compl. ¶ 49(G)(1).) These allegations, though Minimal, are sufficient to state a claim against Wehner in his individual capacity by claiming that the ""conduct causing the [alleged] constitutional deprivation occur[ed] . . . with [his] knowledge and consent."" McPhaul v. Bd. of Comm'rs, 226 F.3d 558, 566 (7th Cir. 2000), petition for cert. filed, No. 00-1144 (U.S. Jan. 16, 2001); see Gentry v. Duckworth, 65 F.3d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1995). It is true, however, that Plaintiffs never offered any evidence that the issuance of the parking tickets or refusal to remove them was done with Wehner's knowledge and consent. Nor did they offer any other evidence upon which Wehner otherwise could be held individually liable for the alleged constitutional deprivation related to the parking tickets, i.e., that Wehner acted or failed to act with a deliberate or reckless disregard of Plaintiffs' constitutional rights, or that the conduct causing the constitutional deprivation occurred at his direction, see, e.g., McPhaul, 226 F.3d at 566; Gentry, 65 F.3d at 561. Thus, the continued prosecution of the claims against Defendant Wehner justifies the imposition of sanctions under § 1988.   Webb alleged that Attorney Moll authored or reviewed for content the reports of the  hoc committee and the AFE Committee. (Compl. ¶ 32, 34(C)(6).) These allegations are sufficient to allege Moll's personal responsibility for the alleged constitutional deprivation related to these reports. However, Plaintiffs failed to present any evidence that either report resulted in any action being taken against Webb. Again, the prosecution of these claims against Moll warrants the imposition of sanctions under § 1988.   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs failed to allege or prove any facts suggesting the Board Trustees acted in bad faith or with conscious disregard of established constitutional rights and moreover, that there was no allegation or evidence that any Trustee took any action at all against Plaintiffs. Thus, Defendants argue the individual capacity claims against the Trustees were an attempt to harass and intimidate them. However, the Complaint does contain allegations that, when read liberally in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, state a claim against the Trustees individually. As for Webb, the Complaint alleges that the Board of Trustees ""is . . . empowered to determine their [BSU employees'] compensation and conditions of employment,"" (Compl. ¶ 4); after Webb filed appeals of the AFE Committee's decision, the Board refused ""to remedy the situation,"" (id. ¶ 33); that during the appeals process Webb received a pay raise ""that was below average and the lowest of all BSU department chairs,"" (id. ¶ 34(A)); the Board failed to respond to Webb's appeals, with the exception of a letter referring his complaint to President Worthen, (id. ¶ 35); the Board refused to give Webb a copy of Defendant Ho's complaint against Webb, (id. ¶ 35(D)); and the Board ""had knowledge of the facts surrounding plaintiff's refusal to restore said relationship [with Richards] and failed to remedy and prevent the injuries, losses, and deprivations suffered by the plaintiff as a result thereof."" (Compl. ¶ 42.) When the Complaint's allegations are read in their entirety and construed generously in the light most favorable to Plaintiffs, with these allegations Webb has stated a claim that the ""conduct causing the [alleged] constitutional deprivation[s] occur[ed] . . . with [the Trustees'] knowledge and consent."" McPhaul, 226 F.3d at 566; see Gentry v. Duckworth, 65 F.3d 555, 561 (7th Cir. 1995). The allegations also allege that the Trustees took actions (or failed to act) against Webb.   As for Wisner, however, the Complaint wholly fails to make any allegation against the individual Trustees which would support an individual capacity claim against them. There is no allegation that any conduct causing an alleged constitutional deprivation to Wisner occurred with a Trustee's knowledge and consent. Nor is there any allegation that any Trustee took any action or failed to take an action against her. Therefore, the bringing of the Section 1983 individual capacity claims against the Trustees individually by Wisner is subject to sanctions under § 1988.   Defendants argue that Plaintiffs' conspiracy claims are sanctionable because Plaintiffs failed to plead any facts to suggest an agreement among Defendants to violate Plaintiffs' rights and Plaintiffs never offered any evidence of such an agreement. ""At a minimum, a complaint must contain facts sufficient to state a claim as a matter of law, and mere conclusory allegations of a conspiracy are insufficient to survive a motion to dismiss."" Fries v. Helsper, 146 F.3d 452, 457 (7th Cir. 1998) (citing House v. Belford, 956 F.2d 711, 721 (7th Cir. 1992)).   Webb brought his § 1983 conspiracy claim against all Defendants with the exception of South. Wisner alleged a § 1983 conspiracy against the Defendants Board, Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, K. Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, P. Thomas, Worthen, Vander Hill, Johnstone, Moll, Falling, Hendricks, Comley, Byers, Ho, Brown, Beck, Wehner, and McCauley. The Complaint lacks any factual allegation of a conspiracy or agreement between Defendants to violate Plaintiffs' rights. The Complaint then alleges in conclusory fashion that ""defendants . . . committed the foregoing acts and omissions in concert and as part of a conspiracy to deprive Plaintiff WEBB of his rights . . . in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983"" (Compl. ¶ 40) and ""defendants . . . committed the foregoing acts and omissions in concert and as part of a conspiracy to deprive Plaintiff WISNER of her rights . . . in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983."" (Id. ¶ 51.) Even when Plaintiffs are given the benefit of the doubt of their conclusory allegations, the Complaint nevertheless fails to make a specific allegation that the following Defendants entered into an agreement or conspiracy against Webb: the Board, Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, K. Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, P. Thomas, Van Meter, Eidson, Avila, Earhart, Hayes, Henderson, Kabadaki, Lyon, Merten, Milner, Ulman, Wilson, Yardon, Falling, Parkison, Hoson, Whitaker, Wright, Hendricks, Comley, Byers, Ho, Brown, Pitts, Wehner, McCune and Aldridge; or that the following Defendants entered into a conspiracy or agreement against Wisner: Board, Bracken, Conrad, Davis, Smulyan, K. Thomas, DeWeese, Hughes, Moake, Parks, Schenkel, P. Thomas, Moll, Falling, Wehner, and McCauley. Thus, the conspiracy claims against said Defendants by Webb and Wisner are sanctionable under § 1988.    For Webb's conspiracy claim, the Complaint alleges that Cotlar conspired with Bennett to file a false complaint against Webb with the AFE Committee (Compl. ¶ 30); that Moll conspired with Johnstone, Vander Hill, Richards, Airriess and Lowe to draft the AFE Committee decision against Webb (id. ¶ 32); that Vander Hill, Richards, Johnstone and Moll conspired to draft or modify the  hoc committee's decision (id. ¶ 34(C); that Beck, Vander Hill conspired to disrupt the Department and make it difficult for Webb to perform his duties as chairperson (id. ¶ 35(E)); and that Johnstone and McCauley conspired to deny Webb computer access, (id. ¶ 35(G)). For Wisner's conspiracy claim, the Complaint alleges that Ho, Hendricks, Brown, Byers, Comley, Beck, Worthen, Vander Hill and Johnstone in concert had a series of interactions with Department personnel resulting in unjustified written criticisms of Wisner and other retaliatory acts (Compl. ¶ 49); and Beck conspired with Vander Hill to transfer Wisner to a new job, (id. ¶ 49(E)).   Furthermore, the only evidence offered to support the conspiracy claim in response to Defendants' dispositive motion was a paragraph in Webb's affidavit that: ""The behavior of Jim Hendricks, Bryan Byers, Michael Brown, Jean Comley, and Taiping Ho during the fall semester of 1996, made it very clear that they had met with Provost Vander Hill or his subordinate, Dean Johnstone."" (Webb Aff. 12/24/97 ¶ 30.) This statement is conclusory and fails to provide specific facts to establish an agreement or conspiracy among Defendants, let alone a conspiracy to violate Plaintiffs' rights. As the court observed previously, at best this statement would support a finding that certain Defendants met with Vander Hill or Johnstone; it does not address the purpose or outcome of any such meetings. (See Entry Regarding Pending Mots. at 23-24 n. 7.)   Plaintiffs respond that testimony was presented at the preliminary injunction hearing of meetings Johnstone and Vander Hill had with some of Webb's adversaries in the Department, citing Tr. Prelim. Inj. Hrg. at 211-17 (Vander Hill testified he met in February 1995 with Richards and Meagher regarding the Meagher matter; he met with Steve about Webb; he met with Byers about studying in Oxford; he met with Cotlar; he met with Michael Brown regarding his teaching, a teaching loan, some concerns he had over research and concerns he had about the department unrelated to Webb), 480-81 (Johnstone testified that he was contacted by Drs. Ho, Byers and Hendricks in the fall of 1996 regarding Webb and the mistreatment of Dr. Ho), such that the conspiracy allegations were not totally groundless. Plaintiffs further argue discovery was necessary to determine the exact nature of the meetings and their relationship to the events which followed them. Even if Vander Hill's testimony arguably supported a conspiracy claim against some Defendants, the only Defendants about which Vander Hill testified he met on any matter were Johnstone, Byers, Cotlar, Brown, Ho and Hendricks. Absolutely no evidence was presented to support a conspiracy claim against other Defendants; thus, such claims have no basis in fact.    This individual is not identified by last name or position.   Defendants next argue that many of them were sued under § 1983 despite that the facts pled alleged conduct clearly outside the limitations period. Bringing and pursuing claims that are clearly foreclosed by precedent such as a statute of limitations can be sanctionable conduct. See Fred A. Smith Lumber Co. v. Edidin, 845 F.2d 750, 752-54 (7th Cir. 1988) (counsel pretended potentially dispositive authority did not exist; persisted in putting forth claims despite fact that statute of limitations clearly barred claims; and acted in bad faith in filing a fraud claim in hopes that future discovery would lead to sufficient facts to support such a claim); Hamilton v. Daley, 777 F.2d 1207, 1212-13 (7th Cir. 1985). It is well-established that in § 1983 civil rights actions the applicable limitations period is borrowed from state tort law, Wilson v. Garcia, 471 U.S. 261 (1984); Venters v. City of Delphi, 123 F.3d 956, 967 (7th Cir. 1997), which in Indiana is two years, see Venters, 123 F.3d at 967. The Complaint was filed on August 4, 1997. Plaintiffs sued the following individual Defendants, alleging only acts or omissions against them that occurred before August 4, 1995: Airriess, Lowe, Alvila, Earhart, Hayes, Henderson, Kabadaki, Lyon, Merten, Milner, Ulman, Wilson, Yardon, Van Meter, Eidson and McCune.    Given Defendants' reliance on § 1983 case law, the court understands them to be directing this stale claim argument to the § 1983 claims against the individual Defendants.   Plaintiffs respond that they were entitled to allege that the acts of Defendants were continuing violations. Courts have been reluctant to apply the continuing violation theory outside the Title VII context. See Tolbert v. Oh. Dep't of Transp., 172 F.3d 934 (6th Cir. 1999); McGregor v. La. State Univ. Bd. of Supervisors, 3 F.3d 850 (5th Cir. 1993). One Seventh Circuit case has applied the theory in the § 1983 context, see Palmer v. Bd. of Educ., 46 F.3d 682 (7th Cir. 1995), though in a drastically different factual situation. That case considered whether an allegedly racially discriminatory school closing plan constituted a continuing violation. The school district had two high schools: one was predominantly African-American, the other was predominantly Caucasian. The district closed the former and bussed the students to the latter. Parents of an African-American student sued three years later, and Defendants argued the suit was untimely. Id. at 683. In holding that the claim was not time-barred, the court reasoned that each year the school board decided which school to use and which children were assigned to which school. The court continued: ""each year's decision to leave the building shuttered is a new violation. . . ."" Id. at 686.   One district court has held the theory applicable in a § 1983 action where the plaintiff, a prison physician, sued three corrections officials alleging that they engaged in a conspiracy to retaliate against him for exercising his First Amendment rights. See Allen v. Iranon, 99 F. Supp.2d 1216, 1239 (D.Hawaii 1999). The court found that the defendants had a mutual understanding to harass the plaintiff in retaliation for his exercise of his free speech rights and that all allegations against the defendants were sufficiently related to constitute a continuing violation. Id.; but see DeGrassi v. City of Glendora, 207 F.3d 636, 644-45 (9th Cir. 2000) (holding former city council member's § 1983 claim based upon alleged continuing campaign to interfere with her First Amendment rights and destroy her political reputation and career was not saved by continuing violation theory where plaintiff alleged ""a long-standing state of animosity and hostility, marked by incidents of personal conflict between her and other City officials"" but did not show a series of related wrongful acts). Neither the Seventh Circuit nor the Supreme Court has addressed whether the continuing violation theory is applicable in a § 1983 claim alleging a series of related wrongful acts. Because this area of the law is not settled and there is at least some support in the Allen case for Plaintiffs' position, Plaintiffs' § 1983 claims (including the conspiracy claims) are not sanctionable due to staleness, see Vandenplas v. City of Muskego, 797 F.2d 425, 430-31 (7th Cir. 1986) (claims are not likely to be frivolous if the state of the applicable law is unclear or in flux).   Defendants contend that Webb sued student newspaper reporter Terrance Aldridge alleging an article he wrote was defamatory and a constitutional tort even though the claim was foreclosed by Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693 (1976). Defendants maintain that counsel should have know the claim was foreclosed before filing suit and, then when confronted with Defendants' motion to dismiss, should have dismissed the claim. They argue that by failing to dismiss the claim, Plaintiffs unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings. In response, Plaintiffs argue that Webb's affidavit of January 22, 1998, contained evidence that Aldridge had met with certain university administrators, suggesting his involvement in the conspiracy and that the newspaper article was defamatory because it alleged immoral conduct. Plaintiffs once again miss the point and ignore controlling precedent.   In Paul v. Davis, the Supreme Court held that one's reputation alone, apart from a tangible interest such as employment, is not a property or liberty interest entitled to due process protection. Paul v. Davis, 424 U.S. 693, 701 (1976). The Complaint alleged that Defendant Aldridge deprived Webb of property and liberty in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause and the First Amendment. (Compl., Count III ¶ 39 and Count IV ¶ 39.) Under the well-settled precedent of Paul, the allegations against Aldridge failed to state a claim for a deprivation of due process: The Complaint merely alleged that Aldridge defamed Webb and that Webb suffered an injury to his reputation and mental distress (id.); the Complaint did not allege that the injury to Webb's reputation accompanied a deprivation of any tangible interest such as employment. Because the Complaint failed to allege that Aldridge deprived Webb of a federally protected interested, it failed to state a § 1983 claim against Aldridge, see Graham v. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 393 (1989). Since an actual deprivation of federally protected rights is an essential element of a § 1983 civil conspiracy claim, see Scherer v. Balkema, 840 F.2d 437, 442 (7th Cir. 1988), the Complaint failed to state a § 1983 conspiracy claim against Aldridge, even if Plaintiffs' had some evidence that Aldridge met with certain university administrators.   Had Plaintiffs' counsel undertaken a reasonable investigation into the law, they would have discovered this fact before filing suit. The § 1983 claim and § 1983 conspiracy claim against Defendant Aldridge are frivolous, unreasonable and without legal foundation. The filing of these claims is therefore sanctionable under § 1988. Further, Plaintiffs' counsel's refusal to concede that these claims were without legal foundation and to dismiss them once it became clear that no claim was stated against Defendant Aldridge, needlessly required the court to rule on the frivolous claims, was without any plausible legal basis or justification for such refusal, and reflects at a minimum recklessness and indifference. By not dismissing the claim against Aldridge Plaintiffs' counsel pursued a course ""that a reasonably careful attorney would have known, after appropriate inquiry, to be unsound"". See Walter v. Fiorenzo, 840 F.2d 427, 433-34 (7th Cir. 1988). The refusal to dismiss the § 1983 claims against Defendant Aldridge was unreasonable and vexatious and, therefore, sanctionable under § 1927.   It is claimed by Defendants that Plaintiffs and their counsel alleged Defendants violated well-established constitutional law (Compl. ¶ 24), but Plaintiffs and their counsel failed to research the law before filing their allegations and failed to acknowledge controlling legal precedent when brought to their attention. This claim appears to be sound. For example, Count I of the Complaint alleges that Webb was denied ""substantive and procedural due process under BSU regulations"" by the AFE Committee. (Id. ¶ 31.) Yet, at the time the Complaint was filed it had been well-established that a procedural due process claim premised upon the failure to follow procedures provided under state law or regulations was frivolous as a matter of law. See Swartz v. Scruton, 964 F.2d 607, 610 (7th Cir. 1992) (""Procedural interests under state law are not themselves property rights that will be enforced in the name of the Constitution.""); Greening v. Moran, 953 F.2d 301, 304 (7th Cir. 1992) (stating claim that the state failed to follow its own procedural rules in violation of due process is frivolous) (citing Szabo Food Serv., Inc. v. Canteen Corp., 823 F.2d 1073, 1080 (7th Cir. 1987); cf. Parratt v. Taylor, 451 U.S. 527, 541-43 (1981) (holding due process not violated by random, unauthorized act by state employee where state cannot predict or realistically prevent deprivation and state provides a meaningful post-deprivation remedy); Hudson v. Palmer 468 U.S. 517, 532-33 (1984) (extending Parratt to intentional deprivations of property). This frivolous procedural due process claim warrants the imposition of § 1988 sanctions.    This is in addition to those against Defendant Aldridge.   To state a procedural due process claim, a plaintiff must allege that: (1) he or she had a protected life, liberty or property interest; and (2) he or she was deprived of that interest without due process of law. See Parratt, 451 U.S. at 531-35. The Plaintiffs alleged deprivations of both property and liberty interests. They argued that because Webb had a property interest in his continued employment as a tenured professor, if ""the defendants attempt to terminate him without just cause, he would be entitled to raise a claim of deprivation of that property interest without due process under the Fourteenth Amendment."" (Pls.' Suppl. Resp. Defs.' Mots. Dismiss Summ. J. Mem. Supp. at 3.) Plaintiffs, however, neither claimed nor offered evidence that any Defendant attempted to terminate Webb's employment. Thus, Webb's due process claim to the extent it was based on an alleged deprivation of his property right to his continued employment was frivolous and without any plausible factual foundation. The making of such a claim is therefore sanctionable under § 1988.   Plaintiffs also claimed Webb suffered deprivation of property interests involving a pay raise and his removal from the Department's Chair position. They did not allege or offer any evidence that Webb had a legitimate claim of entitlement to a better raise or the Chair position. It was well-established in 1997, though, that ""[t]o have a property interest in a benefit, a person . . . must have more than a unilateral expectation of it. He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it."" Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972). Thus, Webb's due process claims based on alleged deprivation of property interests in his pay raise and Chair position were legally and factually groundless and are sanctionable under § 1988.   As for Wisner, Plaintiffs claimed she was denied a property right, but neither alleged nor proved any facts to support that claim. Nor did they argue in response to Defendants' motion for summary judgment on the due process claims that Wisner was denied any property right. The total failure to support such a claim with any factual allegations or evidence justifies the imposition of sanctions under § 1988 for bringing a frivolous claim without foundation in fact or law.    As for Wisner, the Plaintiffs' Supplemental Memorandum does not even attempt to argue that she was deprived of a liberty interest. More importantly, the Plaintiffs have not come forward with any evidence which would support such a claim by Wisner.   Plaintiffs also alleged violations of their First Amendment rights. The claimed protected speech included Webb's reporting of allegations of sexual harassment of students by two faculty in the Department (Meagher and Cotlar). Though the court ultimately concluded that Plaintiffs' speech was not protected because they were not speaking on matters of public concern, such complaints could have constituted protected speech under different circumstances. Furthermore, though the Complaint alleged other instances of arguably protected speech, for example, the Plaintiffs' filing of an action in state court (Compl. ¶ 35) and their filing of EEOC Charges of Discrimination (id. ¶¶ 36, 46, 49(G), 51), Plaintiffs did not rely on them in opposing Defendants' dispositive motion.   But a plaintiff asserting a First Amendment retaliation claim must demonstrate ""that the protected speech caused, or at least played a substantial part in"" the decision to take an adverse employment action against the employee. See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977). Plaintiffs wholly failed to present any evidence that any of Defendants' actions were motivated by the claimed protected speech. This utter failure warrants sanctions under § 1988 for bringing and prosecuting frivolous claims lacking any factual basis.   3. Preliminary Injunction Request  Finally, Defendants argue that Plaintiffs unreasonably multiplied the proceedings by requesting a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction lasted approximately six days during the holiday season. The immediacy of the injunction, Plaintiffs' claimed, was because of the course scheduling assignments and the impending start of the winter semester. It is uncontradicted that Plaintiff Webb, however, had known of the course assignments since at least early September, but waited until mid-December to seek injunctive relief. From the presentation of evidence at the hearing, Plaintiffs had not spent the intervening three months gathering facts and evidence to support their claims and request for injunctive relief. Rather, it became obvious to the court that they used the preliminary injunction hearing in large part as a discovery tool. This demand of valuable court time as well as the time of opposing counsel and Defendants unreasonably and vexatiously multiplied the proceedings in this case. Plaintiffs were entitled to seek a preliminary injunction in the broad sense, true enough. But Plaintiffs lack of preparedness and use of the hearing as a discovery tool in great part cannot be condoned. Counsel should be sanctioned under § 1927 for abusing the time and resources of the court and defense counsel.    Thus, Plaintiffs' complaint that no discovery was taken in this case falls on deaf ears. It is noted that Plaintiffs moved for additional discovery, but their motion failed to comply with FED. R. CIV. P. 56(f).   The court takes seriously a request for sanctions and is generally hesitant to impose sanctions but finds them warranted here for the various reasons stated supra. The court further finds that a sanctions award is necessary to deter frivolous filings in cases such as this.   D. Calculation of a Reasonable Attorneys' Fee  Having decided that sanctions are appropriate, the court now turns to the issue of the appropriate amount of an award of attorneys' fees. Determination of a reasonable attorney's fee begins with the lodestar amount which is calculated ""by multiplying the number of hours reasonably expended on the litigation times a reasonable hourly rate."" Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 888 (1984) (citing Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424[, 433] (1983)); see Uphoff v. Elegant Bath, Ltd., 176 F.3d 399, 407 (7th Cir. 1999); Leffler v. Meer, 936 F.2d 981, 985 (7th Cir. 1991). The court may reduce or augment the lodestar amount by considering twelve factors, Hensley, 461 U.S. at 430 n. 3, commonly referred to as the Hensley factors. ""The party seeking the fee award bears the burden of proving the reasonableness of the hours worked and the hourly rates claimed."" Spegon v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, 175 F.3d 544, 550 (7th Cir. 1999); see Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433. The district court must exclude from the lodestar amount any hours that were not reasonably expended. Id. In addition, ""[w]here the documentation of hours is inadequate, the district court may reduce the award accordingly."" Hensley, 461 U.S. at 433; Harper v. City of Chicago Heights, 223 F.3d 593, 605 (7th Cir. 2000), cert. denied sub nom., City of Chicago Heights Chicago Heights Election Comm'n v. Harper, 121 S.Ct. 883 (U.S. Jan. 22, 2001) (""when a fee petition is vague or inadequately documented, a district court may either strike the problematic entries or (in recognition of the impracticalities of requiring courts to do an item-by-item accounting) reduce the proposed fee by a reasonable percentage.""). To compensate for the delay in payment of attorney's fees, the court may make an adjustment by calculating the fee using the attorney's current rates. See Smith v. Village of Maywood, 17 F.3d 219, 221 (7th Cir. 1994).    The factors are: ""(1) the time and labor required; (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions; (3) the skill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (4) the preclusion of employment by the attorney due to acceptance of the case; (5) the customary fee; (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent; (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances; (8) the amount involved and the results obtained; (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys; (10) the ""undesirability"" of the case; (11) the nature and length of the professional relationship with the client; and (12) awards in similar cases."" Id.   An attorney's ""reasonable hourly rate"" should be based on the ""market rate"" that lawyers of similar ability and experience in the community charge for the types of services rendered. See Spegon, 175 F.3d at 554-55; People Who Care v. Rockford Bd. of Educ., 90 F.3d 1307, 1310 (7th Cir. 1996). An attorney's billing rate is presumptively the prevailing market rate for the attorney's services. See Spegon, 175 F.3d at 555; People Who Care, 90 F.3d at 1310; Gusman v. Unisys Corp., 986 F.2d 1146, 1150 (7th Cir. 1993). The party seeking fees bears the burden of presenting evidence of the market rate. See Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886, 895 n. 11 (1984); Harper, 223 F.3d at 604; Spegon, 175 F.3d at 554. If the party seeking fees offers evidence of the market rate, then the burden is on the opposing party to show why a lower rate is more appropriate. See Spegon, 175 F.3d at 554-55; People Who Care, 90 F.3d at 1313.   Plaintiffs have not challenged the reasonableness of the attorney's fees requested by Defendants, except for a passing incorporation by reference to Attorney Dowling's broad sweeping and conclusory criticism of the fees. Instead, Plaintiffs seek a hearing on Defendants' petition and an opportunity to be heard and question the reasonableness and calculation of the requested fees. In his separate response limited to sanctions sought against him, Mr. Dowling challenges the overall reasonableness of the fee request (calling the request ""bloated""), but does not challenge the hourly rate claimed by defense counsel. Defendants' fee petition was filed on January 31, 2000, and the verified and amended fee petition was filed on June 23, 2000. Pursuant to Local Rule 7.1, a party opposing a motion has fifteen days after service of the motion to respond thereto. S.D. IND. L.R. 7.1(a). The time for being heard on these matters has long passed. Plaintiffs filed a response to the petition for fees but simply chose not to directly address the reasonableness and calculation of the requested fees. They therefore have waived any right to contest the reasonableness or calculation of the requested fees. Plaintiffs' request for a hearing is DENIED.   Mr. Dowling urges that the ""inflated"" amount of fees requested justifies denial of the request for fees, citing Hamilton v. Daley, 777 F.2d 1207, 1215 n. 7 (7th Cir. 1985) (stating that ""the more time and effort a defendant spends in defending a Section 1983 case, the less likely it is that the case was frivolous and that a fee award is appropriate""); Brown v. Stackler, 612 F.2d 1057, 1059 (7th Cir. 1980) (counsel claimed over 800 hours of billable time in a simple case which would be disposed by a decision in a pending case). Neither case holds that a request for a substantial amount of fees alone justifies denial for the fee request. Hamilton expressly held that an award of attorney's fees was appropriate. Hamilton, 777 F.2d at 1215. The court, however, questioned why defendants spent so much time on the case where the case was frivolous from the filing of the complaint-the claim was barred by absolute prosecutorial immunity. Id. at 1214-15. The court therefore remanded the case for a determination of whether the work performed was appropriate under the circumstances. Id. at 1215-16. The Seventh Circuit in Brown affirmed the district court's denial of § 1988 fees where most of counsel's work consisted of motions for extension of time and the plaintiff's action ""raised an issue which everyone knew would be controlled by the results of litigation pending in other courts."" Brown, 612 F.2d at 1058. The court found counsel's claim of over 800 billable hours ""intolerably inflated"" and ""outrageously unreasonable"" such that it warranted a complete denial of the fee request. Id. at 1059.   Brown is factually distinguishable from the instant case. Plaintiffs' action did not raise issues controlled by pending litigation in other courts and defense counsel did much more than merely file requests for extensions of time. Moreover, the Seventh Circuit has concluded in a case subsequent to Brown that a complete denial of a fee request is not warranted simply because a fee request is ""excessive and unreasonable."" Zabkowicz v. West Bend Co., Div. of Dart Indus., Inc., 789 F.2d 540, 549-50 (7th Cir. 1986).   In an effort to avoid the imposition of sanctions under § 1927 against him, Ralph E. Dowling, Plaintiffs' local counsel attempts to minimize his role as counsel in this action. (See Resp. Pls.' Local Counsel Ralph E. Dowling Sanctions Mot. at 8-9 (arguing he was not retained to advise Plaintiffs as to the advisability of any course of action pursued but rather, inter alia, ""to be available for rapid filings,"" ""to file the complaint and summons,"" and ""to proofread documents for style, form and compliance with local rules.""); R. Dowling Aff. ¶¶ 2(a)-(f), 3-4, 10.) Mr. Dowling claims that he ""questioned no witnesses at the injunction hearing."" (Resp. Pls.' Local Counsel at 9.) The official transcript of the preliminary injunction hearing, however, belies this claim. The transcript indicates that Mr. Dowling questioned Paul Errington, albeit briefly. (Tr. Prelim. Inj. Hrg., Vol. II, at 324-29.) Mr. Dowling urges that the duty of local counsel is reduced, citing Long v. Quantex Resources, Inc., 108 F.R.D. 416, 417 (S.D.N.Y. 1985). But § 1927 makes no differentiation between the liability of local counsel and foreign counsel. And, even in Long local counsel was held accountable for filing papers in violation of Rule 11. See Long, 108 F.R.D. at 417.   Mr. Dowling argues that Defendants have not identified any particular conduct of his that is sanctionable under § 1927. He states that the ""the only things he filed with the Court were those papers necessary to initiate the suit-most notably the Complaint. And, local counsel did not write the Complaint."" (Resp. Pls.' Local Counsel at 9) (citations omitted). Mr. Dowling ignores the fact that the very act of signing or filing, that is ""presenting,"" a complaint may be sanctionable. Cf. Fin. Inv. Co. (Bermuda) Ltd. v. Geberit AG, 165 F.3d 526, 533 (7th Cir. 1998) (applying pre-1993 version of Rule 11 and stating that the signing of the complaint violated Rule 11); FED. R. CIV. P. 11(b) (""By presenting to the court (whether by signing, filing . . .) a pleading. . . .); FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments) (""The person signing, [or] filing . . . a document has a nondelegable responsibility to the court, and in most situations is the person to be sanctioned for a violation."") Mr. Dowling offers no legal authority to support his implicit assumption of a requirement that the person presenting the complaint have written the complaint and the court is unaware of any.    Like the pre-1993 version of the rule, the 1993 amendments to the rule applicable here require attorneys to conduct a reasonable inquiry into the facts and law before signing pleadings and prescribes sanctions for a violation of this duty. See FED. R. CIV. P. 11(b)(2) and (3); FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments).   Mr. Dowling also argues that § 1927 authorizes sanctions for conduct that occurs only after a case is commenced, citing MGIC Indem. Corp. v. Moore, 952 F.2d 1120, 1121 (9th Cir. 1991), and Yagman v. Baden, 796 F.2d 1165, 1187 (9th Cir. 1986). That may be the law in the Ninth Circuit. The Seventh Circuit, however, has held that the filing of a complaint can constitute an unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of the proceedings and therefore be sanctionable under § 1927. See Fin. Inv. Co., 165 F.3d at 533 (counsel filed suit in federal district court in Indiana after learning that none of plaintiffs had a colorable claim in litigation in federal district court in Florida). Overnite Transp. Co. v. Chicago Indus. Tire Co., 697 F.2d 789, 794 (7th Cir. 1983), quoted by Mr. Dowling is distinguishable because the claim in that case was one of first impression and, further, the prior action in that case had been filed in state rather than federal court.   Mr. Dowling states that he undertook the equivalent of 3-4 days of legal research into the relevant statutes and case law when Plaintiffs approached him about acting as counsel in the case. Given the fast approaching end of the limitations period, counsel is not expected to have undertaken as complete a prefiling inquiry as he could have had Plaintiffs approached him earlier. See Smith v. Our Lady of the Lake Hosp., Inc., 960 F.2d 439, 444, 447 (5th Cir. 1992); FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments) (explaining that the extent to which one has researched the issues and found some support for the theories through consultation with other counsel should be considered in determining whether paragraph (b)(2) has been violated). Further, Mr. Dowling states that the legal theories of the Complaint seemed consistent with his knowledge of the law as well as the explanation of the law of with lead counsel, Jonah Goldschmidt. The advisory committee's note to Rule 11 states that in determining whether legal claims are warranted by existing law or a nonfrivolous argument for the extension, modification or reversal of existing law or establishment of new law, a court should consider ""the extent to which a litigant has researched the issues and found some support for its theories . . . or through consultation with other attorneys. . . ."" FED. R. CIV. P. 11 advisory committee's note (1993 amendments). Defendants do not seek sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, but the court believes equity favors consideration of like factors in determining the appropriateness of sanctions under § 1927. The court will take these things into consideration when determining whether § 1927 sanctions against Mr. Dowling are warranted and, if so, in what amount. The court defers decision of these matters for another day, however.   Because the court is unable to determine what portion of Defendants' claimed attorneys' fees and expenses are attributable to sanctionable claims, the court finds supplemental documentation necessary. It would be next to impossible to determine what sanction, if any, is appropriate against Mr. Dowling under § 1927 without the benefit of that supplementation since that statute ""provides only for excess costs caused by the plaintiffs' attorneys' vexatious behavior and consequent multiplication of the proceedings, and not for the total costs of the litigation."" Roadway Exp., Inc. v. Piper, 447 U.S. 752, 756 n. 3 (1980) (quotation omitted); Pac. Dunlop Holdings, Inc. v. Barosh, 22 F.3d 113, 120 (7th Cir. 1994).   Neither Plaintiffs nor Mr. Dowling on his own behalf have offered any evidence to contradict the hourly rates claimed by Defendants' counsel-$150.00 per hour for partners and $130.00 per hour for senior associates. As the evidence offered by Defendants is unrebutted, the court is required to base the attorney's fee award on the rates claimed by defense counsel, see Pressley v. Haeger, 977 F.2d 295, 299 (7th Cir. 1992) (holding court abused its discretion in reducing attorney's hourly rate used to compute attorney's fees where claimed rate was supported by affidavits of attorneys participating in case and by affidavit of another attorney verifying the market rates).   The court, however, is without sufficient information to determine the appropriate attorneys' fee and sanction award. In support of Defendants' fee petition, Defendants submitted the affidavit of Scott E. Schockley, their attorney, with attached billing statements for the months of August 1997 through December 1999. The court cannot discern from the entries in the billing statements which requested fees were incurred in defending against the sanctionable claims. Though some entries are somewhat specific, as a general rule the entries are lacking in sufficient detail. The entries for September 1, 2 and 3, 1997 are illustrative. They provide as follows:    For example, an entry for September 8, 1997, includes ""research re Title VII retaliation.""    9/01/97 JHM 1.00 Research re defenses to claims 9/02/97 SES 0.50 Research 9/02/97 JHM 0.90 Research law 9/03/97 SES 3.00 Research on Motions  From entries such as these the court cannot determine whether the time expended doing research or other activity is attributable to the sanctionable claims and whether the expenditure of time was reasonable. Therefore, the court directs Defendants to submit revised documentation in support of their fee petition, providing a sufficient explanation of the expenditure of attorney time and expenses to allow the court to ascertain the reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses and to determine the amount of fees and expenses attributable to the sanctionable claims. The supplemental submission should be limited to time expended on matters for which sanctions are being allowed in this entry. The court will assume that the Defendants seek reimbursement for two-thirds of the amount of time expended on those, as reflected above in footnote number two.    A reasonable attorneys' fee includes ""expenses of litigation that are distinct from either statutory costs or the costs of the lawyer's time reflected in his hourly billing rates — expenses for such things as postage, long-distance calls, xeroxing, travel. . . ."" Heiar v. Crawford County, Wis., 746 F.2d 1190, 1203 (7th Cir. 1984).   As for Defendant Wynola Richards, she seeks total attorney fees in the amount of $3,037.50 as stated in the affidavit of her attorney, Roger P. Ralph. Plaintiffs do not challenge Attorney Ralph's request hourly rate of $125, and this rate is identical to the rate awarded earlier in this case for the fees related to the quashing of the subpoena served on Richards. The affidavit, however, fails to provide any information upon which the court could find that all of the 25.7 hours expended (in addition to the 3.6 hours expended in quashing a subpoena served on Richards) in the defense of this action were reasonable and expended in defense of the sanctionable claims. Therefore, the court directs Defendant Richards to submit revised documentation in support of her fee petition, providing a sufficient explanation of the expenditure of attorney time and expenses on the matters with respect to which sanctions are being awarded, only, to allow the court to ascertain the reasonableness of the requested fees and expenses and to determine the amount of fees and expenses attributable to the sanctionable claims.   III. Conclusion  Plaintiffs' request for a hearing on Defendants' petition for fees is DENIED. Defendants' petition for attorneys' fees and motion for sanctions as well as their verified and amended petition for attorneys' fees and motion for sanctions are GRANTED.   Defendants are ORDERED to submit revised documentation supporting their request for attorneys' fees, costs and expenses within fifteen days of the date of this entry to assist the court in determining the appropriate amount of the fee and sanction award.

I promise I will never again,” Galindo said in texts shared with the Globe by the woman, then a junior and one of the few female students in her department. “By the way, just to let you know, we never [had intercourse],” said another text in the mea culpa. “I never got it up. I was too drunk. It doesn’t excuse anything, but I thought I’d let you know what a loser I am.”Get Breaking News AlertsStay up-to-date with important news developments, delivered right to your inbox.A Globe investigation has uncovered a culture of blatant sexual harassment at Berklee with at least three male professors, including Galindo, allowed to quietly leave since 2008, after students reported being assaulted, groped, or pressured into sex with their teachers, according to court documents and interviews with more than a dozen people. Administrators at the renowned music school tolerated lecherous behavior, former Berklee students and employees said, and often silenced the accusers through financial settlements with gag orders attached.Berklee administrators defended the school’s track record, saying in a statement that Berklee has rigorous policies and procedures to deal with claims of sexual harassment.“Although we do not discuss specific matters publicly out of respect for all involved and limitations on what we are legally permitted to share, we take matters that impede the learning or working environment of our students, faculty, and staff seriously and act promptly to address them,” the school said.The allegations against the Berklee professors come at a time of heightened attention to sexual harassment following revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of groping, raping, and harassing women for decades. Since the scandal became public last month, women have felt empowered to speak up about alleged abuse, especially when they believe their abusers remain free to victimize others.The woman who reported being assaulted by Galindo said that when she initially spoke with Berklee administrators in 2012, they discouraged her from pressing forward with a court case because, she said, they assured her Galindo would never work at another school.Yet Galindo went on to teach at the New England Conservatory in Boston. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears professional reprisals, was horrified to discover in 2016 that Galindo was teaching again and notified the conservatory. His contract there was not renewed, according to the school. But he continued working at the Longy School of Music of Bard College in Cambridge until last week, when the woman found out he was employed there, contacted administrators, and the school severed ties with him. Galindo had worked there since 2009.Jeff Galindo in 2010.“If I didn’t report him [to other schools], it would be on me if he did this again,” the woman said.Still, Galindo has continued teaching. He is listed as a part-time faculty member at the Rivers School, a college prep school in Weston. Christine Martin, a Rivers spokeswoman, said Tuesday that Galindo has been affiliated with the school since 2015, and that he arrived with positive references. She was unable to say who had provided those references. On Wednesday, another spokeswoman called the Globe after this story was published online to say that Galindo had been terminated, effective immediately.Berklee, in a statement, said one institution requested a reference regarding Galindo and “we provided the termination letter which included an explicit statement that explained the reasons for his departure from the college.” A Berklee spokesman declined to say when that correspondence happened or which institution requested the information.On Wednesday, within hours of this story going online, a student-led change.org petition had already gathered more than 290 signatures demanding Berklee “properly address” these types of allegations.Galindo did not return calls and text messages from the Globe seeking comment.‘I am not an idiot’But another former Berklee professor accused of sexual misconduct, prominent jazz saxophonist Greg Osby, did speak with the Globe. A woman accused Osby in 2012 of pressuring her to have sex while she was a student at Berklee. The woman, who also asked to remain anonymous, had graduated several years earlier and established a successful music career, but later reported him to Berklee administrators after growing concerned he might still be preying on students.“I could not bear the feeling that I had a responsibility to do something about this,” said the woman about her decision to finally contact Berklee.Osby, in an hourlong interview with the Globe, disputed the woman’s claims. He also said that he received a severance package from Berklee that included a gag order.“Only an idiot would sleep with students, and I am not an idiot,” Osby said. “I would not do that. But after they graduate, it’s open season.”Osby said Berklee did not give him a chance to defend himself against the claims, but he decided not to contest the charges because he was burned out teaching there.“Bottom line is, and this is a bit harsh, if anyone saw my girlfriend at that time and saw [his Berklee accuser] that would probably end the argument,” Osby said. “Why would I jeopardize my career for somebody like that?”The statement issued by Berklee said the school is committed to a “fair and thorough process for both complainant and respondent,” and that not every case leads to a finding.“As evidenced by our past practices, where an investigation reveals a serious violation of our sexual misconduct policy, we act swiftly and decisively to remove the individuals from our community,” Berklee said.Complaint filed with MCADYet a case filed earlier this year with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, or MCAD, raises questions about Berklee’s commitment to address the issue.Greg Osby at Berklee College of Music in 2010. Chitose Suzuki for The Boston Globe/FileA 2012 Berklee grad who was hired to run the school’s audio production lab accused a male co-worker of predatory behavior, according to a complaint she filed with MCAD in January. She described unwanted sexual advances by her co-worker toward female students in the lab in mid-2015 and then retaliation against her — leaving condoms in the lab and suggesting sexual liaisons — when she reported his behavior to their boss. But Berklee administrators waited weeks to act, and then failed to monitor the co-worker, who repeatedly violated an order they issued for him to stay away from her, the complaint states.The woman also accused Berklee of brushing off her concerns about inappropriate sexual behavior by a professor in the school’s music production department last year.She “continued to observe and experience a pattern, practice, and pervasive culture of tolerance of sexual harassment at Berklee,” according to the MCAD complaint.Berklee settled the case in April, and that settlement is sealed, too. The woman and her attorney, North Reading lawyer John W. Davis, declined to comment.The former student who accused Galindo of assaulting her when she was too drunk to fend him off said she worked up the nerve to report him to Berklee administrators about six months later. He was let go shortly after. There was no notice to students, no apology to the woman, and no financial settlement.The woman, who was receiving a partial scholarship, said she was afraid even to apply for additional financial aid from Berklee after she reported the assault because Galindo accused her of concocting the story to gain more scholarship money.“I wanted to be believed so bad,” the woman said. “I thought if I ever said anything about money, no one would ever believe me.”Instead, she sought and received private therapy, paid for by Berklee, to help her deal with the trauma. She showed the Globe e-mails from Angela F. F. Davis, then Berklee’s associate dean of students, authorizing these payments. Davis, now an executive director in the state’s Executive Office of Public Safety and Security, recently led the agency’s initiative to secure funding for preventing violence against women. She declined to comment.One of the student’s former professors, Tom Plsek, now chair emeritus of the brass department at Berklee, also confirms the woman’s story.“She confided first in a female faculty member . . . and then I found out about it from that female faculty member,” Plsek said.

Administrators at the renowned music school tolerated lecherous behavior, former Berklee students and employees said, and often silenced the accusers through financial settlements with gag orders attached.Berklee administrators defended the school’s track record, saying in a statement that Berklee has rigorous policies and procedures to deal with claims of sexual harassment.“Although we do not discuss specific matters publicly out of respect for all involved and limitations on what we are legally permitted to share, we take matters that impede the learning or working environment of our students, faculty, and staff seriously and act promptly to address them,” the school said.The allegations against the Berklee professors come at a time of heightened attention to sexual harassment following revelations about Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, who faces accusations of groping, raping, and harassing women for decades. Since the scandal became public last month, women have felt empowered to speak up about alleged abuse, especially when they believe their abusers remain free to victimize others.The woman who reported being assaulted by Galindo said that when she initially spoke with Berklee administrators in 2012, they discouraged her from pressing forward with a court case because, she said, they assured her Galindo would never work at another school.Yet Galindo went on to teach at the New England Conservatory in Boston. The woman, who asked to remain anonymous because she fears professional reprisals, was horrified to discover in 2016 that Galindo was teaching again and notified the conservatory. His contract there was not renewed, according to the school. But he continued working at the Longy School of Music of Bard College in Cambridge until last week, when the woman found out he was employed there, contacted administrators, and the school severed ties with him.

He is listed as a part-time faculty member at the Rivers School, a college prep school in Weston. Christine Martin, a Rivers spokeswoman, said Tuesday that Galindo has been affiliated with the school since 2015, and that he arrived with positive references. She was unable to say who had provided those references. On Wednesday, another spokeswoman called the Globe after this story was published online to say that Galindo had been terminated, effective immediately.Berklee, in a statement, said one institution requested a reference regarding Galindo and “we provided the termination letter which included an explicit statement that explained the reasons for his departure from the college.” A Berklee spokesman declined to say when that correspondence happened or which institution requested the information.On Wednesday, within hours of this story going online, a student-led change.org petition had already gathered more than 290 signatures demanding Berklee “properly address” these types of allegations.Galindo did not return calls and text messages from the Globe seeking comment.‘I am not an idiot’But another former Berklee professor accused of sexual misconduct, prominent jazz saxophonist Greg Osby, did speak with the Globe. A woman accused Osby in 2012 of pressuring her to have sex while she was a student at Berklee. The woman, who also asked to remain anonymous, had graduated several years earlier and established a successful music career, but later reported him to Berklee administrators after growing concerned he might still be preying on students.“I could not bear the feeling that I had a responsibility to do something about this,” said the woman about her decision to finally contact Berklee.Osby, in an hourlong interview with the Globe, disputed the woman’s claims. He also said that he received a severance package from Berklee that included a gag order.“Only an idiot would sleep with students, and I am not an idiot,” Osby said. “I would not do that. But after they graduate, it’s open season.”Osby said Berklee did not give him a chance to defend himself against the claims, but he decided not to contest the charges because he was burned out teaching there.“Bottom line is, and this is a bit harsh, if anyone saw my girlfriend at that time and saw [his Berklee accuser] that would probably end the argument,” Osby said. “Why would I jeopardize my career for somebody like that?”The statement issued by Berklee said the school is committed to a “fair and thorough process for both complainant and respondent,” and that not every case leads to a finding.“As evidenced by our past practices, where an investigation reveals a serious violation of our sexual misconduct policy, we act swiftly and decisively to remove the individuals from our community,” Berklee said.Complaint filed with MCADYet a case filed earlier this year with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, or MCAD, raises questions about Berklee’s commitment to address the issue.Greg Osby at Berklee College of Music in 2010.

She described unwanted sexual advances by her co-worker toward female students in the lab in mid-2015 and then retaliation against her — leaving condoms in the lab and suggesting sexual liaisons — when she reported his behavior to their boss. But Berklee administrators waited weeks to act, and then failed to monitor the co-worker, who repeatedly violated an order they issued for him to stay away from her, the complaint states.The woman also accused Berklee of brushing off her concerns about inappropriate sexual behavior by a professor in the school’s music production department last year.She “continued to observe and experience a pattern, practice, and pervasive culture of tolerance of sexual harassment at Berklee,” according to the MCAD complaint.Berklee settled the case in April, and that settlement is sealed, too. The woman and her attorney, North Reading lawyer John W. Davis, declined to comment.The former student who accused Galindo of assaulting her when she was too drunk to fend him off said she worked up the nerve to report him to Berklee administrators about six months later. He was let go shortly after. There was no notice to students, no apology to the woman, and no financial settlement.The woman, who was receiving a partial scholarship, said she was afraid even to apply for additional financial aid from Berklee after she reported the assault because Galindo accused her of concocting the story to gain more scholarship money.“I wanted to be believed so bad,” the woman said. “I thought if I ever said anything about money, no one would ever believe me.”Instead, she sought and received private therapy, paid for by Berklee, to help her deal with the trauma.

Berklee president confirms another misconduct case



	Roger Brown, president of the Berklee College of Music.  




								By Kay Lazar, The Boston Globe							

								November 16, 2017							





Roger Brown, president of the Berklee College of Music.
She grew up in Taiwan, where stepping forward to accuse a professor of sexually inappropriate behavior — of forcing her to hug him before each piano lesson, and demanding she remove her jacket so he could scrutinize her dress — was not something young women do.
But after escalating e-mails from her piano teacher, Bruce Thomas, seeking a closer relationship, the Berklee College of Music junior reported him to school officials in the fall of 2015. She brought all of Thomas’s often bizarre late-night messages as evidence.


Still, it would take Berklee officials another year — despite mounting evidence brought to administrators of similar behavior by Thomas toward at least four other Asian students — to fire the 35-year veteran of the school.
Berklee president Roger Brown, in an interview Wednesday, acknowledged that Thomas was one of 11 faculty members terminated since 2004 for sexual misconduct. Brown defended how administrators at the famed music school have handled allegations of sexual impropriety.
Wednesday night, Brown sent a message to thousands of Berklee alumni noting the “impassioned and vigorous dialogue on campus’’ regarding sexual misconduct and predicted “it is likely that more details of abuse will emerge in the media.’’ He encouraged alumni who experienced sexual misconduct while at Berklee, or knew of someone who had, to report it to the college.
Brown and his administration have been under fire since the Globe reported last week that at least three faculty members had been quietly let go after students accused them of assault or harassment.
Hundreds of students walked out of class on Monday and attended a forum, led by Brown, at which he acknowledged that the problem was greater still, involving at least 11 faculty members over the past 13 years.
As the scandal continues to unfold, Brown said Wednesday that the school will seek guidance from a nationally renowned consultant on federal sexual abuse and harassment laws to help Berklee figure out its next steps.


In the interview, Brown declined to disclose the names of the 11 terminated faculty members — one of several demands made by students during Monday’s emotional forum — but acknowledged the three already identified by the Globe in last week’s article. He confirmed that Thomas was also among the 11.
“If we terminate someone and release their name, their impulse is to blame the person’’ who reported them, increasing the chances the student’s name would be revealed, Brown said.
“I don’t defend [Thomas’s] behavior, and I am not trying to say it was appropriate,’’ Brown said. “But the sanctions, as we went through this, seemed right at the time, and when we got enough evidence, we terminated.’’
Thomas did not return phone calls seeking his comment.
“Do we publicly disclose, or do some release saying professor X was terminated on date Y for sexual misconduct?’’ Brown said.
The Globe’s story last week noted that some cases of alleged sexual abuse at Berklee were quietly resolved with financial settlements that included confidentiality agreements, barring all sides from discussing the cases.
Brown said that in the cases of the 11 faculty members fired for sexual misconduct, none received more than the amount promised in their employment contracts, which often ran three or more years.


“In most cases they were paid less, or sometimes a lot less,’’ he said.
Brown declined to elaborate further on the financial settlements offered to the faculty’s victims.
At Berklee, men predominate in sheer numbers, accounting for 68 percent of students and faculty, according to the school. That imbalance was cited during the Monday forum by faculty and students as contributing to a culture that, they said, has long tolerated sexual misconduct.
For the Asian woman who stepped forward to report Thomas’s behavior, the anxiety was as much about her family as it was the overwhelming male presence on campus.
“My family was against me reporting him, because it’s really a cultural thing,’’ said the woman, who graduated in May and asked to remain anonymous for fear of professional repercussions. “They think I have no chance to win this because he is an old American teacher and I am no one, so he can take revenge.’’
In a series of e-mails and Facebook postings to the woman, Thomas wrote of his longing to see her after she stopped taking his classes, and noted that he was searching for her at various local concerts. The woman shared those e-mails and Facebook postings with the Globe.
After the woman reported Thomas in the fall of 2015, the college issued a written warning to him, according to Berklee. He had already received a verbal warning about his behavior toward another women, the college says.
She said she became aware of at least two other Asian women who had fended off similar behavior from the piano teacher. She said that in the spring of 2016, she brought copies to Berklee officials of e-mails he sent to those women. But she said Berklee officials told her they could not take action unless those two other women, who were too fearful to speak out, agreed to step forward.


Then in July 2016, another Asian woman complained to Berklee about Thomas’s aggressive and increasingly strange behavior.
Finally, in November, he was fired, according to the termination letter. In all, Thomas was accused of inappropriate behavior toward six students over nearly 18 months, according to Brown. The president said the six included a woman who had reported Thomas to the school in early 2015.
That was six months before the Taiwanese woman defied her family’s wishes and spoke out.
Brown defended his administrators’ actions, saying the woman must have misunderstood what Berklee officials told her when she brought evidence of Thomas’s misconduct toward two more students in 2016.
“If the message was interpreted that we can’t do anything if they do not come forward, that’s not true,’’ Brown said.
“We said, can you encourage someone to come forward, but we can do investigations whether someone comes forward or not.’’
Berklee enrolls students from 151 countries, according to Brown. After the Globe’s story last week, one faculty member said she had heard from nearly four dozen students about concerns for foreign students.
“My students are telling me the vast majority of students who are preyed upon [by faculty] are international students who are afraid of losing their scholarship and student visas’’ if they speak out, said the faculty member who asked that she not be identified for fear of professional reprisals. “I didn’t hear this from one student, I heard this over, and over, and over, again.’’

Neither Berklee College nor Steve Kirby have responded to requests from CBC News for further information.The University of Manitoba has previously said Kirby, who taught jazz with the university's school of music, retired in late June after being on leave for six months.​'Burden of work' left to complainantsCiting provincial privacy legislation, the University of Manitoba would not tell Berklee College about its sexual harassment investigation involving Kirby, prompting many of his alleged victims to contact Berklee themselves.""Putting the burden of work on victims' shoulders, victims who are sorting through their own trauma, who are dealing with their own situation, their own lives that have been affected by this — putting that burden of work on those students is abominable to me,"" said Nancy.CBC has confirmed at least six of the women involved in a February 2017 complaint against Kirby independently contacted Berklee College, and communicated their concerns and the university investigator's conclusions.Jazz prof Steve Kirby fired from Berklee CollegeFeatured VideoSteve Kirby has been terminated from his job at Berklee College of Music after a number of University of Manitoba students and former students told the Boston-based college they had been harassed by the jazz professor during his time at the U of M.The University of Manitoba's internal reports from last June detailed allegations of inappropriate comments, sexually explicit analogies, unwanted and lingering touching, long unwanted hugs and intimate ear-whispering.  In reports reviewed by CBC, the investigator concluded all of the allegations had merit and that Kirby's alleged behaviour constituted ""sexual harassment"" and would have created an ""intimidating, humiliating or offensive work or learning environment"" for female students.Although repeated attempts by CBC News to reach Kirby have been unsuccessful, in the university's internal investigation report, he ""denies all claims made of any sexual innuendo or outright sexual approaches.""The women at the heart of the internal sexual harassment investigation into Kirby's conduct say the province's flawed privacy laws forced them to contact, and warn, his new employer.The University of Manitoba told CBC it cannot share the details of internal investigations about staff because of provincial legislation. Both the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) and Workplace Health and Safety rules prohibit the university from sharing the information, the university said.""The university is not able to proactively disclose information about investigations to external third parties. This would be a breach of legislation, including privacy and workplace, safety and health,"" the university's executive director of public affairs, John Danakas, said in a statement to CBC in September.FIPPA 'safety clause' allows wiggle roomBut there is some wiggle room within the existing legislation.""Disclosures are permitted under specific circumstances, where disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of any individual or group of individuals,"" said Cathy Cox, the provincial minister responsible for FIPPA, in a statement to CBC.So when Berklee started looking into the matter, why didn't the University of Manitoba enact the ""safety"" clause and share its internal investigation findings with Berklee College?""Most experts will explain that the safety clause requires a high onus to demonstrate 'imminent danger,' as it involves taking away an individual's inherent right to privacy,"" Danakas explained in an email.""Even the police only use those sections on occasion when a person, for example, is released from prison and deemed likely to reoffend.""'They didn't believe that we were in danger'""It shows that they didn't quite take it seriously enough. They didn't believe that we were in danger,"" said a woman CBC is calling Krista, another student who took her concerns both to the university and to Winnipeg police.""Physically, the women were in danger. Some physicality happened. Mentally, we were all impacted. We were all damaged and in danger,"" Krista said.""Our self-worth was gone. Our belief in our self was gone.… Our passion was gone. Women were so torn apart by this.""Krista said she's angry the university didn't use the safety exemption in FIPPA to share its investigation with Berklee.""It doesn't look like they did this to support their students, to stop something that was wrong.… They did this to cover their butts,"" Krista said.""The university takes matters concerning sexual harassment very seriously and abides by legal guidelines in the sharing of any information,"" Danakas countered.'Be loud with your opinions'The students say since the news of the investigation broke this fall, many in the Winnipeg music and university communities have approached them and asked how they can help.""The only thing I would hope for from the public — and from this community and society — is to respect the privacy and understand, and work towards, protecting our young women,"" Krista said.""What does that look like? That is speaking to the government about provincial laws, writing letters, writing petitions,"" she said.""Put your opinions forward to the university, to the government about the privacy laws. If you feel unsafe or unhappy with the university and how they've conducted themselves, let them know — schedule meetings, write to them,"" Krista said. ""Be loud with your opinions.""Krista is the second woman who told CBC that she has filed a report to police about Kirby's alleged conduct.Internal change neededThe women say change isn't needed only at the provincial level — it's needed within the university as well.""I think there's a big lack of education at the university, within the university staff,"" said Nancy.""I want to believe that had they been better educated about this, they would have made better choices,"" she said. ""And it's a problem when the staff at the university is not trained to know when someone is coming forward speaking to you about abuse that they are experiencing, it is likely the tip of the iceberg.""Nancy believes the university needs to develop better supports for students to guide them through the complaint process and keep them in the loop about the progress being made.""Sharing this kind of information is very distressing for a victim [who] often is in the middle of processing it themselves. So staff at the university needs to be more educated about trauma and this type of abuse. If they are not, they need to direct us to people who are.""The University of Manitoba says that since September, it has has taken a number of steps to address sexual harassment. It described those steps as: Meetings between senior U of M leadership and the Faculty of Music Students' Association. Constructive, primarily listening opportunities. Meetings between U of M leadership and the University of Manitoba Student's Union and the Graduate Students' Association. Beginning process of policy review. Meetings between faculty of music dean and associate dean, and music students and music student leadership. Commitments to adopt best practices, such as appointing liaisons to assist students with concerns. Open session for all music students to answer questions on behavioural matters. Two open sessions for university community to discuss behavioural policies.   Workshops for staff on responding to disclosure. Discussion of behavioural matters with commitments to inform review process at several levels, such as the student experience committee. Got a tip for the CBC News I-Team?

Aryeh MOTZKIN, Plaintiff,
v.
TRUSTEES OF BOSTON UNIVERSITY, Defendant.
C.A. No. 95-10450-RCL.
United States District Court, D. Massachusetts.
August 5, 1996.

REPORT AND RECOMMENDATION REGARDING DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT (FILED ORIGINALLY AS A MOTION TO DISMISS) 
(DOCKET NO. 6) 
June 4, 1996
KAROL, United States Magistrate Judge.
In 1992, defendants, the Trustees of Boston University (""Trustees"" or ""BU""), entered into a contract with plaintiff, Aryeh Motzkin (""Motzkin""), under which Motzkin would teach three courses per semester in BU's College of Liberal Arts (""CLA"") during the academic years 1993-94, 1994-95, and 1995-96. By letter dated March 31, 1995, effective immediately, Motzkin was notified that the Trustees had voted to accept the recommendation of a specially appointed faculty committee that Motzkin's contract be terminated for cause. The committee's recommendation was based on its finding, following a several-day adjudicatory hearing, that Motzkin had sexually harassed students, sexually assaulted and harassed a faculty colleague, violated BU's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Policy by serving alcohol to underage students, and made false reports to the hearing committee regarding the charges against him. Motzkin denies some of those charges, but he does not dispute that he is unfit to teach. To the contrary, he insists that, because of a psychological disorder from which he suffers that causes ""disinhibition,"" (Am.Compl., docket no. 16, ¶¶ 7-9), he lacks sufficient control, even with counseling and medication, to refrain from engaging in intolerable conduct of the very type in which the faculty hearing committee found he had engaged. Nonetheless, he commenced this lawsuit challenging his termination on grounds ranging from breach of contract to discrimination on the basis of disability. (Compl., docket no. 1) Then, after BU had filed its present motion, Motzkin amended his complaint to include, among other things, a claim that BU defamed him and invaded his right to privacy by filing certain confidential documents and leaking information to the press. (Am. Compl.) For reasons stated below, I recommend that all eight counts of Motzkin's amended complaint be dismissed.[1] 
I. BACKGROUND AND PRIOR PROCEEDINGS
Unless otherwise noted, the facts stated in this section are either undisputed or stated in the light most favorable to Motzkin. See, *986 e.g., Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 48 (1st Cir. 1990). 
A. Motzkin's Special Appointment
Motzkin was initially hired by BU in 1987 or 1988 to teach courses within the CLA's Core Curriculum and Department of Philosophy. (Am.Compl. ¶ 5; Salary History and 1989 Faculty Salary Recommendation Form, attached to Aff. Counsel Regarding Contract Records, docket no. 13, of 5/8/95.) He was given the untenured rank of Associate Professor. (1989 Faculty Salary Form.) The record is unclear whether he was on a tenure track for a period of time prior to 1992, but, in any event, he had not obtained tenure by the end of 1992. Moreover, he had made it clear by his words and conduct that his overriding interest was teaching  not research, writing, or publishing. Accordingly, by letter dated December 4, 1992 (but dated November 7, 1992 on its second page), CLA Dean Dennis D. Berkey (""Berkey"") offered Motzkin a special, three-year teaching appointment as a nontenured Associate Professor of the Humanities and Adjunct Associate Professor of Philosophy. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem.Supp.Mot. Dismiss (""Def.'s Supplem.Mem.""), docket no. 21, Ex. 1.) For each semester through academic year 1995-96, Motzkin was to teach the equivalent of two courses within the Core Curriculum and one philosophy course within the Department of Philosophy. (Id.) As Berkey emphasized in his letter: This appointment is extended in recognition of your strong contributions in teaching to the Core Curriculum. It is a special appointment, with primary emphasis on the teaching role. Therefore, in accepting this appointment you must agree to relinquish any claim for tenure status on the basis of the longevity of your service on the faculty of Boston University.
(See id. ¶ 6 (emphasis added).) Motzkin accepted this ""special appointment"" on December 9, 1992. (Id. at 2.)
Although Berkey did not, in his December 4 letter, specifically alert Motzkin to the fact that his appointment could be terminated early for cause, he referred to the Faculty Handbook (the ""Handbook"") as governing the issue of reappointment and the question whether Motzkin would be eligible for future tenure consideration. (See id. ¶¶ 5, 7.) Both parties attached excerpts of the Handbook to their pleadings in this lawsuit and often referred to it as authoritative with respect to the issues in this case. This is not surprising, since the Handbook, by its terms, provides that the policies set forth in it ""are applicable University-wide to all faculty employed by Boston University"" and that ""[a]n individual's acceptance of employment at Boston University is sufficient to make the terms of the University's policies applicable without further notice or agreement."" (Mem.Supp.Def.'s Mot. Dismiss Compl. (""Def.'s Mem.""), docket no. 8, Ex. C at 44.) On the basis of these statements, BU asserts, and Motzkin agrees, (Tr. of 7/13/95 Hr'g, docket no. 33, at 9, 64), that the policies and procedures set forth in the Handbook, including the ones discussed below dealing with early termination, are incorporated into Motzkin's contract.
The Handbook devotes an entire section to policies and procedures by which faculty members may be suspended or terminated on the basis of ""gross neglect of duty or other applicable cause ... during the term of an appointment."" (Handbook at 67-69.) Those particular policies and procedures were adopted December 4, 1990, which was approximately two years after Motzkin's initial appointment and two years before he accepted the appointment that is the subject of this lawsuit. (Id. at 67 n. *.) The Handbook sets forth an elaborate process that must be followed before a faculty member may be terminated for cause ""during the term of an appointment."" (Id. at 67-69.) The final step in that multi-stage process is described in the Faculty Handbook as follows: 8. Consideration by the Board of Trustees. The Board's review of the case shall be based on the record of the hearing [conducted by special committee of five faculty members appointed for that purpose] and any further briefs presented in *987 writing by the principals and/or their representatives. The decision of the Board of Trustees shall be final.
It was pursuant to this process that the Trustees purported to terminate Motzkin's special appointment effective March 31, 1995. (Def.'s Mem.Ex.H.) 
B. Allegations Against Motzkin
Complaints against Motzkin first surfaced during the 1991-92 academic year, when several female students reported that he was pressuring them to attend a party at his house. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. D: Statement of the Grounds for the Suspension or Termination of the Appointment of Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin (""Statement of Grounds""), dated 1/95, ¶ 4(a).) Because the students were unwilling to file formal charges, the Chairman of the Department of Philosophy, Professor Charles Griswold, raised the subject with Motzkin informally and advised him to be careful regarding his conduct toward students. (Id.)
The following fall, a student in one of Motzkin's classes registered concern to Assistant Dean Brian Jorgensen about an incident in which Motzkin had approached her where she worked and invited her to lunch. (Id. ¶ 4(b).) He addressed the matter with Motzkin, who gave assurances that he would avoid such conduct in the future. (Id.)
Concerns about Motzkin escalated shortly after September 11, 1993. On that date, Motzkin took an underage female student to dinner off campus, ostensibly to discuss the possibility of her doing some translation work for him. (Id. ¶¶ 3(b), 7; Motzkin Aff., docket no. 27, Ex. A: letter from Motzkin to Berkey of 9/28/93, at 2-3.) It is undisputed that, during dinner, in violation of BU's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Policy, Motzkin purchased the student some wine to accompany her meal. (Id. at 2.) According to the student (but denied by Motzkin), he also made suggestive remarks. (Id. at 2-3; Statement of Grounds ¶ 3(b).) This incident prompted Berkey to issue a formal reprimand to Motzkin and a warning that ""a future reoccurrence of this type of situation could result in more severe sanctions."" (Am.Compl. ¶ 11; Statement of Grounds ¶ 4(c) (quoting letter from Berkey to Motzkin of 10/18/93.))
In May 1994, Berkey received a memorandum from a female faculty member in which the faculty member alleged that, beginning in 1991, Motzkin had made repeated, unwanted advances toward her; had sexually assaulted her; and had frequently intimated that, in exchange for her favors, he would be willing to use his purported influence with senior administration officials to help her get tenure. (Def.'s Mem.Ex.D: Statement of Additional Grounds for the Suspension or Termination of the Appointment of Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin (""Statement of Additional Grounds"") ¶¶ 8-15.) The faculty member declined to file a formal complaint at that time, however. (Id. ¶ 16.)
In the summer of 1994, Berkey met with Motzkin and admonished him not to dine alone with female students away from campus. (Statement of Grounds ¶ 4(d).) He also told him that he was in a ""strike-two situation,"" that his current contract would not be renewed, that he should start looking for another position, and that any additional misconduct would result in his termination. (Id.) Despite this explicit warning, Motzkin promptly took another underage student to dinner off campus on September 27, 1994; purchased alcohol for her in violation of BU's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol Policy; drove her to a suburban hotel (the circumstances are disputed but the fact that he did so is not); and allegedly engaged in offensive and inappropriate conduct. (Id. ¶¶ 3(c), 7; Motzkin Aff.Ex.A: letter to the Sexual Harassment Committee from Motzkin of 10/27/94 at 1-5.) Around the same time, one of Motzkin's former students came forward with allegations that, in October 1990, Motzkin had invited her to his house under false pretenses and made inappropriate remarks and suggestions of a sexual nature to her while they were there. (Id. at 5-6; Statement of Grounds ¶ 3(a).) 
C. BU's Response to Allegations Against Motzkin
In response to some of the foregoing allegations and pending their resolution, Berkey, by letter dated October 6, 1994, relieved *988 Motzkin of all teaching and other responsibilities. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. A: letter from Berkey to Motzkin of 10/6/94.) The letter referred to and invoked the CLA Policy on Sexual Harassment (the ""CLA Policy""). (Aff.Pl.'s Counsel Verifying Docs. Re: Count VII Relating to Violation of Univ. Policies and Procedures (""Aff.Pl.'s Counsel""), docket no. 29, Ex.B.) It also warned Motzkin that ""[t]he matters are of such gravity that they may provide a basis for seeking the termination of your employment for cause."" (Letter of 10/6/94 at 1.)
It is unclear from the record what precise steps BU took to resolve the complaints against Motzkin under the CLA Policy. That issue is immaterial, however, because BU did not purport to terminate Motzkin pursuant to the CLA Policy. Rather, it purported to do so pursuant to the different set of university-wide policies and procedures set forth in the Handbook and which the Handbook, by its terms, makes applicable to all BU faculty members.[2] Therefore, in the discussion below, consideration will be given only to the investigation and adjudication of the allegations against Motzkin that purportedly took place in accordance with the policies and procedures set forth in the Handbook.
As noted, relevant excerpts from the Handbook are included in the record. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. C; Aff.Pl.'s Counsel Ex.C.) In essence, the Handbook lays out a several-step process for the resolution of questions raised regarding ""the fitness of a faculty member ... whose term of appointment has not expired."" (Handbook at 67-69.) First, an attempt is made to resolve the matter informally through discussion at the administrative level. (Id. at 68.) Second, if informal, administrative resolution is not achieved, an  hoc committee of three faculty members is appointed to attempt to mediate a settlement or, if that too is unsuccessful, to recommend to the Provost whether ""formal proceedings should be instituted."" (Id.) Third, formal proceedings are instituted if either the  hoc committee or the Provost determines that it is appropriate to proceed further. (Id.) At that point, the Provost and the committee are required jointly to prepare a detailed statement of the grounds for suspension or termination, or, if they cannot agree on how to proceed, the Provost may prepare such statement unilaterally. (Id.) Then, pursuant to procedures prescribed in the Handbook, a committee of five faculty members is selected to hear the charges and a hearing is conducted. (Id.)
The accused faculty member is assured various rights in connection with the hearing, including the right to respond in writing and orally to the charges against him or her, to be represented by counsel, to call and confront witnesses and introduce evidence, and to demand that certain evidence be produced. (Id. at 68-69.) The Handbook also provides, however, that ""the hearing shall be conducted in an informal manner reasonably calculated to ascertain the truth and shall not be limited by formal rules of evidence or other restrictions usually employed in legal proceedings."" (Id. at 69.) Following the hearing, the committee must make a decision within ten days. (Id.) Specifically, it must make ""explicit findings with respect to each of the charges presented."" (Id.) Further, ""if warranted,"" it shall ""recommend suspension, termination, or other appropriate discipline."" (Id.) Once it has completed its work, it delivers its report to the faculty member, the Provost, and the President. (Id.) The President then ""may either reject the recommendation and terminate the proceedings"" or forward the report to the Trustees, with or without his or her own recommendation.[3] (Id.) The Trustees then make *989 a decision regarding disciplinary action, which decision, as noted, ""shall be final."" (Id.) At that point, restrictions on publicity are lifted and any announcement of the Trustees' decision must ""include a statement of the Hearing Committee's findings."" (Id.)
Various documents included in Exhibit D to the Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss Complaint (docket no. 8) reflect BU's compliance with the Handbook's pre-hearing procedural requirements. The earliest document in Exhibit D is a copy of a letter dated December 23, 1994, to the Provost from the three-member  hoc committee appointed to consider the charges then pending against Motzkin. In the letter, the  hoc committee reported its unanimous recommendation that formal proceedings be instituted. The next document in Exhibit D is a copy of a letter dated January 11, 1995, from the Provost to Motzkin in which the Provost advised Motzkin that he had accepted the  hoc committee's recommendation and was enclosing the formal statement of charges that the Provost had formulated, ""in consultation with the committee."" The enclosed statement of charges described in detail most of the allegations set forth above. It omitted, however, any reference to the allegations that were contained in the May 1994 memorandum to Berkey from the faculty member, presumably because the faculty member was still unwilling to press charges. Another document included in Exhibit D is a copy of a letter dated January 25, 1995, from the Provost to Motzkin. The January 25 letter informed Motzkin that the charges against him had been amended to include the allegations of the faculty member who had, until then, ""been unwilling ... to permit her testimony to be used."" A detailed statement of the new charge was included, and Motzkin was given an additional fourteen days to prepare his response.
While BU was considering the charges against Motzkin in the fall of 1994, it received a letter dated November 21, 1994, from the attorney who was then representing Motzkin, Douglas T. Schwarz. (Def.'s Mem.Ex.B.) The letter purported to advise BU of ""new information"" regarding a ""depressive disorder"" from which Motzkin was purportedly suffering that, in combination with the medication he was taking and other factors, might have reduced his inhibitions, impaired his judgment, and caused him to ""[take] a female student to dinner off-campus, inattentive to Dean Berkey's earlier letter about precisely this point."" (Id. at 1-2.) The letter claimed that Motzkin was again under the care of a psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Johnson (""Johnson""), and that Johnson was hopeful that, with appropriate treatment, including an anti-depressant medication called Zoloft, ""it is extremely unlikely that [Motzkin] will engage in inappropriate behavior in the future."" (Id.) The letter went on to state: Dr. Motzkin's primary depressive disorder is a handicap under both state and federal law. The University's obligation under such circumstances is to accommodate a person with a handicap unless the accommodation required would impose an undue hardship. I believe that the reasonable accommodation requirement here entails the University monitoring Dr. Motzkin's progress using Zoloft under Dr. Johnson's care. If, as Dr. Johnson believes will be the case, the medication continues to substantially improve the situation, there would seem to be no legitimate reason for preventing Dr. Motzkin from returning to teaching. I suggest that if his improvement is enduring, it would be appropriate that he return to teaching as soon as is practically possible.
(Id. at 2.) This was the first communication that BU received from any source notifying it that Motzkin claimed to suffer from a *990 disability or that the erratic behavior in which he allegedly had engaged might be attributable to it.
By mid-January 1995, the five-member faculty committee appointed to hear the charges against Motzkin (the ""Hearing Committee"") had been appointed. (Def.'s Resp., docket no. 34, Ex. 3: Klafter Aff. ¶ 5.) It began conducting hearings on or about February 20, 1995. (Am.Compl. ¶ 16.) Motzkin was given the opportunity to testify, but, on advice of counsel, he chose to remain silent. (Pl. Motzkin's Opp'n Mot. Dismiss or Summ.J. (""Pl.'s Opp'n""), docket no. 11, at 3 n. 5; Def.'s Mem.Ex. E: Report of the Hearing Committee Considering the Proposed Suspension or Termination for Cause of Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin (the ""Report"") at 1.)[4] Over a period of several days, numerous witnesses apparently did testify either in person or by affidavit, including Johnson and BU's own psychiatric expert, Dr. Louis Vachon (""Vachon""). Motzkin was represented throughout by counsel, and he attended all but the last day of hearings. (Report at 1.) During the course of the hearings, the Hearing Committee heard and ruled upon numerous objections and motions, some of which are the subject of this lawsuit and are discussed in more detail below.
On March 21, 1995, the Hearing Committee issued the Report. It ""found the witnesses to be clear, forthright and credible,"" and it found the ""evidence regarding manipulative, deceptive and harassing behavior on the part of Professor Motzkin"" to be ""compelling and believable."" (Id.) Further, although not necessarily dispositive of the issue of discrimination that Motzkin has raised in this court, the Hearing Committee considered and rejected such claim: Professor Motzkin's attorney argued that the University failed to take action to accommodate Professor Motzkin's alleged conditions or facilitate treatment of them. We have not found sufficient evidence to support this conclusion. Professor Motzkin was repeatedly counseled by superiors concerning the unacceptability of his behavior and the potential consequences to his career. Nevertheless, his pattern of manipulation, deceit and harassment continued into the autumn of 1994. During this period, Professor Motzkin neither claimed an impairment nor sought accommodation for it. The Committee is not persuaded that Professor Motzkin's newly claimed impairment can either excuse or provide grounds for the University to condone his continued harmful behavior. Whatever actions he may take in the future to address the source of the behavior do not justify, at this present time, his continuance as a faculty member at the University. No evidence was presented that Professor Motzkin will in the foreseeable future modify his behavior.... Neither has he requested help from the University with the behavior, other than on one occasion when he suggested to a superior that he might be fined each time he did an act that was deemed inappropriate. Although Professor Motzkin appears to be a skilled teacher, on the basis of the evidence presented, he does not meet the standard of interpersonal behavior required of a faculty member at Boston University.
(Id. at 5-6.)
The Hearing Committee concluded that ""the charges of harassment, sexual harassment, sexual assault, violation of the University's Illegal Drugs and Alcohol policy and lying against Associate Professor Aryeh L. Motzkin are true and proven."" (Id. at 6.) It unanimously recommended that he be ""terminated for cause."" (Id.)
In accordance with the rules prescribed in the Handbook, the Hearing Committee transmitted the Report to the President. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. F: letter from John Silber to Board of Trustees of 3/22/95.) By letter to the Trustees dated March 22, 1995, the President notified the Trustees of his concurrence with the Hearing Committee's recommendation *991 that Motzkin's appointment ""be terminated for cause effective upon the vote of the Board."" (Id.) The Trustees accepted this recommendation, and Motzkin was notified by letter dated March 31, 1995, that his appointment had been terminated for cause. (Def.'s Mem.Ex. H: letter from John Silber to Motzkin.) 
D. Court Proceedings
Motzkin commenced the present lawsuit in Massachusetts Superior Court on or about February 17, 1995, or three days before the Hearing Committee began hearing testimony. (Compl.; Am.Compl. ¶ 16.) His original complaint contained four counts, including one count for breach of contract (Count II) and three counts for discrimination in violation, respectively, of Mass.Gen.L. ch. 93, § 103 (1994) (Count I), of Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (""ADA""), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189 (1994) (Count III),[5] and of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (1994) (Count IV). On or about March 3, 1995, BU removed the case to this court on the ground, among others, that a federal question had been asserted. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441(b) (1994). At the end of March or the beginning of April of 1995, BU filed a motion to dismiss (docket no. 6) and a supporting memorandum (docket no. 8). Although BU had purported to file its motion pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) (1) and (6), it attached a number of exhibits to its memorandum and specifically requested that the court treat the motion as one for summary judgment. (Def.'s Mem. at 1.) On or about May 8, 1995, Motzkin filed a pleading entitled ""Plaintiff Motzkin Opposition to Motion to Dismiss or for Summary Judgment,"" and an amended complaint. (Docket nos. 11 and 16.)
Motzkin's amended complaint sets forth eight counts,[6] preceded by a general section entitled ""Statement of the Facts."" The ""Statement of the Facts"" section alleges that Motzkin ""suffers from mental disorders,"" which disorders were purportedly documented in expert testimony that plaintiff submitted under seal with his amended complaint. (Am.Compl. ¶ 8.) It further alleges that Motzkin's mental disorders (and the medication prescribed to treat them) ""cause disinhibition in certain actions so that an individual may engage in inappropriate conduct that otherwise in a non-disabled state the individual's mind inhibitions would forestop."" (Id. ¶ 9.)
As noted, Motzkin's amended complaint was accompanied by, and specifically alluded to, relied upon, and adopted, expert testimony that Motzkin filed under seal in this proceeding and that had originally been submitted at the hearings conducted by the Hearing Committee. (Mot. Impound Two Docs., docket no. 14, and contents.) The filing that Motzkin made under seal in this case consists of two documents: (1) the Affidavit of Dr. Michael Johnson and (2) excerpts compiled by Motzkin's counsel of testimony by a psychiatric expert  Vachon  whom BU had apparently called as a witness at the termination hearing. In his affidavit, Johnson states his opinion that Motzkin suffers from ""depressive disorders"" and sleep apnea, which, in combination, ""impair the Professor's ability to function and have a marked disinhibitive effect on his conduct."" (Johnson Aff. ¶ 5.) Further, despite the use of medication, ""the disorders remain chronic, at times improving, at times worsening."" (Id. ¶ 6.) Johnson concludes that ""Professor Motzkin suffers from disabilities that continue to impair his ability to function and such disabilities would have impaired his ability to recognize and conform his conduct to the boundaries that would appropriately mark the relationship that should separate a professor and his students."" (Id. ¶ 9.) Along the same lines, Vachon, according to Motzkin's own summary of a portion of the testimony *992 that Motzkin adopted and relied upon in his filings with this court, ""confirmed that there would be impairment in both social and occupational functioning, which would render one disabled from serving as a university professor."" (Pl.'s Submission of Excerpts from the Testimony Under Oath of BU's Psychiatric Expert Dr. Louis Vachon Confirming that Professor Motzkin Suffers from Disabilities at 8.)
As noted, the other pleading that Motzkin filed on May 8, 1995, was his opposition to defendant's motion. In his opposition, Motzkin again referred to and adopted the foregoing psychiatric testimony and opinion. (Pl.'s Opp'n at 3.) He agreed that Count I of his original claim, which had alleged discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of state law, was subject to dismissal for failure to exhaust state administrative remedies.[7] (Id. at 4-5.) With respect to the breach of contract count, Motzkin argued that summary judgment was precluded because of factual disputes regarding the existence of a contract, but he did not explain the basis for his claim that there had been a breach, except to state in conclusory terms that the contract ""was wrongfully terminated."" (Id. at 5.) With respect to the ADA count, he did not address BU's argument that Title I of the ADA, to the exclusion of Title III, concerned employment discrimination, but he did argue that BU was a place of public accommodation. (Id. at 6-7.) Finally, he did not at all address BU's arguments that, because, inter alia, he had admitted in his complaint that he was not ""otherwise qualified"" to perform the essential functions of a university professor, Motzkin had failed to state a claim under the Rehabilitation Act.
On or about June 16, 1995, BU filed Defendant's Supplementary Memorandum in Support of Motion to Dismiss. (Docket no. 21.) This supplementary memorandum addressed some of the points Motzkin had raised in his opposition to BU's original motion, as well as the new counts that were included for the first time in Motzkin's amended complaint. Oral argument on BU's motion was heard on July 13, 1995. (Tr.) At the argument, after confirming that counsel had no objection, the court stated that it would treat BU's motion as one for summary judgment. (Id. at 4.) This was confirmed in a Scheduling and Procedural Order entered that date, (docket no. 22), which order also gave Motzkin until August 4, 1995, to file additional evidentiary material and, if he wished to do so, a motion for discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f). Motzkin took full advantage of this opportunity to make these supplemental filings. (Docket nos. 24 and 26-30.) He also filed a motion for leave to file a second amended complaint, (docket no. 25), which motion is the subject of a separate memorandum and order entered this date. The voluminous filings concerning the present motion were finally completed in September 1995, upon the filing by BU of its response to Motzkin's supplemental filings, (docket no. 34), and a motion to impound certain documents that Motzkin had filed. (Docket no. 31.) 
II. ANALYSIS 
A. Procedural Considerations
Where, as here, materials ""outside the pleading are presented to and not excluded by the court,"" Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b) authorizes the court to convert a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim into a motion for summary judgment, provided that all parties are given notice and the opportunity to present opposing materials. See Whiting v. Maiolini, 921 F.2d 5, 6-8 (1st Cir.1990). These requirements were satisfied here. The court will thus treat BU's motion as one for summary judgment.
The standard for summary judgment is familiar. Summary judgment is appropriate only when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. See Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). At the outset, the moving party must aver that there is ""`an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's'"" position. Garside, 895 F.2d  at 48 (quoting Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S. Ct. 2548, 2554, 91 L. Ed. 2d 265 (1986)). *993 To avoid summary judgment, the opposing party must produce affirmative evidence demonstrating a genuine issue for trial. See Mesnick v. General Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, 504 U.S. 985, 112 S. Ct. 2965, 119 L. Ed. 2d 586 (1992). ""[T]he nonmovant may not rest upon mere allegations, but must adduce specific, provable facts demonstrating that there is a triable issue."" Brennan v. Hendrigan, 888 F.2d 189, 191 (1st Cir.1989). While ""`summary judgment ... should be used sparingly ... where motive and intent play leading roles,'"" Lipsett v. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 895 (1st Cir.1988) (quoting Poller v. Columbia Broadcasting Sys., 368 U.S. 464, 473, 82 S. Ct. 486, 491, 7 L. Ed. 2d 458 (1962)), it is nevertheless available where, on the basis of undisputed facts, the moving party is entitled to prevail as a matter of law regardless of motive. See, e.g., August v. Offices Unlimited, Inc., 981 F.2d 576, 581-82, 584 (1st Cir.1992) (holding summary judgment for employer proper because employee had conceded he was ""totally disabled"" and thus could not establish prima facie case under state civil rights statute similar to Title I of ADA and section 504 of Rehabilitation Act). In reviewing the nonmovant's case, ""the court must look at the record in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and must indulge all inferences favorable to that party."" See Stepanischen v. Merchants Despatch Transp. Corp., 722 F.2d 922, 928 (1st Cir.1983) (citation omitted). This court must therefore review the record in the light most favorable to Motzkin to determine whether he has adduced sufficient admissible evidence to raise a triable issue with respect to any of the eight counts of his amended complaint. 
B. Application of Summary Judgment Standard 
Count I
Motzkin asserts in Count I of his amended complaint that his termination violated Title I of the ADA. (Am.Compl. ¶ 26.) Title I prohibits employment discrimination ""against a qualified individual with a disability,"" defined as a person who can perform the ""essential functions"" of his or her job, with or without reasonable accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8), 12112; see also Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 406-07, 99 S. Ct. 2361, 2367, 60 L. Ed. 2d 980 (1979).[8] In response, BU argues, inter alia, that Motzkin was hired to be a teacher, but, by his own admission, he is not qualified to teach. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem. at 3-4; Def.'s Mem. at 12-16.) It further notes that Motzkin's own expert has opined that Motzkin has an impaired ""ability to recognize and conform his conduct to the boundaries that would appropriately mark the relationship that should separate a professor and his students."" (Def.'s Resp. at 6.) It also points out that Motzkin himself, by quoting Vachon's testimony, supports BU's argument that no genuine issue exists concerning whether Motzkin can perform the responsibilities of his former job. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem. at 4.) BU argues that, under these circumstances, Motzkin is clearly not qualified to teach, and teaching is without doubt an essential  indeed, the defining  function of the appointment that is the subject of this lawsuit. (Def.'s Mem. at 13-14; Def.'s Resp. at 6-7.) Thus, even assuming, arguendo, that Motzkin is an individual with a ""disability"" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12102(2) and that, contrary to the evidence, he was discharged not for his offensive conduct but ""because of the disability,"" within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 12112(a), he is still not entitled to relief under Title I of the ADA.
The court was (and still is) unable to locate within any of Motzkin's many filings even a purported response to this seemingly irrefutable argument. For that reason, the court inquired pointedly at the oral argument whether it is Motzkin's position that ""he is presently qualified as a result of the treatment *994 he is now receiving,"" to which his counsel responded, ""No."" (Tr. at 50.) The court then asked whether Motzkin agrees that ""he is not presently qualified [i.e., even with the treatment he is receiving] to be placed in a classroom teaching University students,"" to which his counsel responded, ""Yes, but that is not the full range of the definition of a professor."" (Id.) In an attempt to understand this last response, the court inquired whether it was Motzkin's position that, even if he was hired to teach, BU had an ""obligation to accommodate [him] by putting him in a nonteaching position."" (Id. at 51.) His counsel responded, ""It's not my position."" (Id.) When pressed to explain her position, however, counsel noted that professors do other things besides teaching, including research and writing, curriculum development, and grading examinations. (Id. at 53.) Motzkin's position thus seems to be that BU has an obligation to create a ""teaching"" position for Motzkin in which he would have all the responsibilities that other teachers have, with the notable exception of teaching.
Motzkin's argument must be rejected. Whatever incidental, non-teaching responsibilities other professors at BU might have, it is undisputed that Motzkin, consistent with his own preference, was given a special teaching appointment that required him to teach three courses per semester in the Core Curriculum and Department of Philosophy.[9] If he is unable to teach the courses that he was hired to teach, someone else will presumably have to teach them. Conversely, he was not hired to do research, or design curricula, or grade examinations, and BU certainly would not have given him the special appointment it did if that were all he was qualified to do. In light of Berkey's December 4, 1992, letter offering Motzkin a ""special appointment, with primary emphasis on the teaching role,"" it simply cannot be disputed that teaching is an essential function of Motzkin's job.
Moreover, even if teaching were not an essential function of Motzkin's special appointment, there is no more reason to believe that Motzkin can be trusted to work in proximity to female colleagues  whether in the library, or on committees, or in other locations or capacities  than to teach female students. Whether or not Motzkin did the things he was accused of doing, there is no place in a university community for someone who is as incapable of controlling his impulses as Motzkin insists he is. See Mazzarella v. United States Postal Serv., 849 F. Supp. 89, 96 (D.Mass.1994) (""Finally, and most importantly, the record demonstrates that no amount of accommodation by [the Postal Service] would necessarily protect its employees and its property from the plaintiff's potential fits."") Therefore, even if teaching were not an essential function of Motzkin's particular appointment, his proposal that he merely be removed from the classroom as a form of ""reasonable accommodation"" would be unacceptable.
Because Motzkin is incapable, with or without accommodation, of performing the essential functions of his job, there is no need to consider BU's other arguments regarding flaws in Motzkin's claim under Title I of the ADA. It should be noted, however, that case law supports a number of BU's alternative arguments. See Little v. FBI, 1 F.3d 255, 259 (4th Cir.1993) (employer subject to Rehabilitation Act must be allowed to terminate employee for ""egregious misconduct"" regardless of whether employee has a disability); Mazzarella, 849 F. Supp.  at 97 (termination of an employee for improper conduct does not constitute discrimination because of a disability pursuant to Rehabilitation Act, even if the improper conduct is attributable to a disability); August, 981 F.2d  at 580-81 & n. 4 (an employer has no obligation to offer another job to employee who, because of a disability, is unable to do the job he or she was hired to perform); Taub v. Frank, 957 F.2d 8, 11-12 (1st Cir.1992) (no liability under Rehabilitation Act for employer's failure to identify and offer treatment for an undisclosed disability that contributes to behavior that constitutes grounds for termination).
For all the foregoing reasons, I recommend that Count I of the amended complaint be dismissed. 

*995 Count II

Count II of the amended complaint states a claim similar to Count I, except that it is brought under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 rather than the ADA. (Am.Compl. ¶ 27.) I recommend dismissal of Count II for the same reason I recommend dismissal of Count I. By his own admission, Motzkin is unfit to teach; therefore, he is not an ""otherwise qualified individual with a disability,"" within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. § 794(a). 
Count III
Count III of the amended complaint purports to state a claim under Title III of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12181-12189. (Am. Compl. ¶ 28.) Title III addresses, among other things, discrimination on the basis of disability by places of public accommodation. Specifically, Title III proscribes discrimination on the basis of disability with respect to ""the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation."" See id. § 12182(a).
The parties' memoranda are somewhat confusing because they tend to deal with two separate issues without clearly distinguishing between them.[10] The first issue is whether Title III covers only physical access to the structures in which businesses that otherwise would be places of public accommodation are located. Some courts have answered this question in the affirmative, see, e.g., Parker v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 875 F. Supp. 1321, 1327-28 (W.D.Tenn.1995) (""Title III only addresses discrimination based on a disabled person's physical abilities to make use of the goods and services of a place of public accommodation""), but the First Circuit has read Title III more broadly. See Carparts Distribution Ctr., Inc. v. Automotive Wholesalers Ass'n of New England, Inc., 37 F.3d 12, 18-20 (1st Cir.1994). The Title III question in Carparts was whether a business could be a place of public accommodation notwithstanding that members of the public did not physically have to go to it in order to purchase goods or services, see id. at 18, which question is not presented here. Nevertheless, in holding that a business could be a place of public accommodation under these circumstances, the court necessarily discussed the closely related question whether Title III deals only with physical access to places of public accommodation. See id. at 18-20. Again, the court read Title III broadly: Neither Title III nor its implementing regulations make any mention of physical boundaries or physical entry. Many goods and services are sold over the telephone or by mail with customers never physically entering the premises of a commercial entity to purchase the goods or services. To exclude this broad category of businesses from the reach of Title III and limit the application of Title III to physical structures which persons must enter to obtain goods and services would run afoul of the purposes of the ADA and would severely frustrate Congress's intent that individuals with disabilities fully enjoy the goods, services, privileges and advantages, available indiscriminately to other members of the general public.
Id. at 20.
Despite this language, BU argues that, as a matter of law, Title III applies only ""to issues of physical access to places of public accommodations."" (Def.'s Mem. at 11.) Carparts clearly rejects this argument. On the other hand, Motzkin also clearly misses the mark when he construes the quoted passage as dispositive of the separate and more relevant of the two issues that BU raises: does Title III deal at all with employment discrimination, or is employment discrimination the exclusive domain of Title I? Since Carparts does not address this question, other sources must be considered.
I first consider the statutory language. Title III proscribes discrimination ""in the full and equal enjoyment of the goods, services, facilities, privileges, advantages, or accommodations of any place of public accommodation."" See 42 U.S.C. § 12182(a). While it *996 could be argued that the terms ""privileges"" and ""advantages,"" in the abstract, are general enough to encompass employment opportunities, one does not ordinarily think of jobs as being among the ""privileges"" and ""advantages"" offered to members of the public by places of public accommodation. Title I, on the other hand, is entitled ""Employment,"" and, by its terms, it clearly applies to virtually all aspects of the employment relationship, See id. § 12112 (proscribing discrimination in regard to ""job application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment""). Indeed, even with respect to physical (and other) accessibility issues within the employment context, it is Title I, not Title III, that directly addresses the area. Specifically, Title I provides that an employer's duty to make reasonable accommodation for employees with disabilities may include ""making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities."" See id. § 12111(9) (A).[11] The legislative intent is so clear from the language of Titles I and III that one need not go beyond that language to conclude that employment discrimination is the exclusive province of Title I.
I proceed, nevertheless, to consider precedent. At least one case is squarely on point, and that case holds that ""Title III does not govern employment practices."" See Parker, 875 F. Supp.  at 1328. In reaching its conclusion, the Parker court cited the following instructive excerpt from the legislative history of the ADA: ""Title III is not intended to govern any terms or conditions of employment by providers of public accommodations ... employment practices are governed by title I of this legislation."" Id. (citing S.Rep. No. 116, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 58 (1989)).
Finally, as a matter of policy, it would make no sense to construe Title III as including employment practices within its scope. Indeed, to do so might wreak havoc with the careful balance that Congress attempted to strike in Title I between the rights of employers and the rights of workers with disabilities. For example, the term ""qualified individual with a disability"" appears in Title I, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111(8), 12112, but is absent from Title III. As a result, if Title III were construed to apply to employment practices, an employer would be within its rights under Title I, but might be liable under Title III, if it denied employment to an individual who, because of a disability, was incapable of performing the essential functions of the job.
I conclude that Title III does not apply to employment discrimination. For this reason, and because Motzkin does not otherwise allege a violation of Title III, I recommend that Count III of the amended complaint be dismissed. 
Count IV
Count IV of the amended complaint, a barebones claim for breach of contract, states, in its entirety, ""The University's termination of Professor Motzkin['s] employment contract constitutes a breach of the mutual rights and obligations of the employment contract."" (Am.Compl. ¶ 29.) Nowhere within the amended complaint or Motzkin's other filings does Motzkin state any particular respect in which BU allegedly failed to honor any promise it made to him, other than to claim that BU terminated his contract prematurely and improperly. (Id. ¶ 1.) For this reason, the court specifically asked Motzkin's counsel at oral argument to identify the alleged breaches. (Tr. at 63.) Counsel identified three: a contract right not to be terminated in violation of the ADA; a contract right not to have the charges against him amended in violation of the procedures set forth in the Handbook; and a contract right that he not be terminated without an impartial termination hearing, or, more specifically, a hearing in which the clerk appointed by the Hearing Committee is not ""an arm of the prosecutor."" (Id. at 63-66.)
*997 It is important to note that Motzkin does not dispute that his contract may be terminated early for cause or that cause would include conduct of the type in which the Hearing Committee found he had engaged. These implicit concessions, in conjunction with Motzkin's admission that he suffers from a disinhibitory disorder that renders him unfit to teach and prone to engage in offensive behavior of the same type that he was charged with, would appear to be dispositive of all his contract claims. Thus, as noted, there can be no violation of the ADA, and, therefore, no breach of contract pursuant to Motzkin's theory that the contract incorporates the ADA, if Motzkin is incapable of performing the essential functions of his job.[12] Similarly, BU's alleged failure to observe certain procedural formalities prescribed by the Handbook would appear to be immaterial, since the outcome of a hearing conducted in a manner that Motzkin would deem ""procedurally proper"" would be the same, given Motzkin's concession that BU has the right to terminate his contract for cause and his admission that disinhibitory disorders render him unfit to teach.
Thus there is no need, in light of Motzkin's concessions and admissions, to consider Motzkin's two contract claims relating to procedures. In the interest of thoroughness, however, I will briefly review them to demonstrate that neither has merit.
First, Motzkin complains about an allegedly improper amendment of the charges against him to include the complaints documented by the faculty member in her May 1994 memorandum to Berkey. (Am.Compl. ¶ 33; Aff.Pl.'s Counsel ¶¶ 1-4, 6.) The gravamen of Motzkin's complaint is that it was a violation of BU's policies and procedures, and, thus, a breach of his contract, to allow the Hearing Committee to consider this particular charge before it had been considered by the Sexual Harassment Committee. (Id. ¶¶ 1-4, 6, Ex. D: Professor Motzkin's Mot. Limit Matters Before Faculty Committee Hearing.)
The first problem with this complaint is that it confuses the CLA Policy, which includes as one step in its process a hearing before a three-person  hoc subcommittee of the CLA's Sexual Harassment Committee, (CLA Policy at 7), with the separate procedures prescribed in the Handbook. (Handbook at 67-69.) Neither the CLA Sexual Harassment Committee nor the three-person  hoc subcommittee of the CLA Sexual Harassment Committee plays any role in disciplinary proceedings commenced pursuant to the Handbook, except that one option available to the CLA  hoc subcommittee is to recommend that the dean initiate action to discipline or terminate the accused pursuant to university procedures. (CLA Policy at 8.) Under the Handbook procedures, the first step in the disciplinary process, if the matter cannot be resolved informally, is to refer the matter to an  hoc committee of three faculty members, which committee is distinct from the CLA  hoc subcommittee. (Handbook at 68.) If the  hoc committee is unable to settle the charges, it makes ""a recommendation as to whether formal proceedings should be instituted."" (Id.) Significantly, however, the Provost may decide that formal proceedings be commenced even if the  hoc committee had recommended otherwise. (Id.)
Given this structure, it is difficult to see how Motzkin could have suffered any prejudice as a result of the failure of the  hoc committee to consider the faculty member's charges. The  hoc committee considered all the other charges and recommended that formal proceedings be commenced as to those. It is inconceivable that, if the faculty member's additional charges had also been considered, the  hoc committee would not have recommended formal proceedings as to the charges that it did consider. Although it is possible that the  hoc committee would not have recommended that the formal proceedings include the faculty member's charges, the Provost would still have had the authority, pursuant to the Handbook, to make a unilateral decision to include them *998 anyway. (Id.) Under these circumstances, where it was the Provost who notified Motzkin of the decision to amend the charges to include the faculty member's complaint, no purpose would have been served to reconvene the  hoc committee solely to have it consider the faculty member's complaint.[13]
Motzkin's second complaint regarding the hearing procedures is that the clerk to the Hearing Committee, Craig Klafter (""Klafter""), an Assistant to the Provost, allegedly worked actively with the BU prosecuting attorney and participated in the Hearing Committee's decision-making. (Am.Compl. ¶¶ 20, 32; Particularized Req. Disc. Under Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(f) Re Count VII, docket no. 28, at 2.) Motzkin's claim is apparently that Klafter's role detracted from the impartiality of the proceedings. Again, there are several problems with this theory.
First, there is no evidence that Klafter participated in the Hearing Committee's decision-making. To the contrary, each member of the Hearing Committee, and Klafter himself, has submitted an affidavit confirming that his duties were purely administrative.[14] (Def.'s Resp.Exs. 1, 3, 4.) The Hearing Committee made all the decisions and Klafter merely reduced them to writing after the committee had communicated them to him and reported them to the parties and their counsel. (E.g., id. Ex. 1: Garland Aff. ¶¶ 7, 12.)
Second, Motzkin seems to assume that, if Klafter or the Provost for whom he was an assistant had any role in investigating the underlying charges or recommending that they proceed to formal adjudication, Klafter would be disqualified from participating in the subsequent adjudication. But courts have repeatedly held in the administrative law context that it is not a violation of due process when persons much more involved in the investigative phase of a case than either Klafter or the Provost was participate directly in the adjudicative phase. See, e.g., Withrow v. Larkin, 421 U.S. 35, 46-55, 95 S. Ct. 1456, 1464-68, 43 L. Ed. 2d 712 (1975); Blinder, Robinson & Co. v. SEC, 837 F.2d 1099, 1104-08 (D.C.Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 869, 109 S. Ct. 177, 102 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1988). In the complete absence of any evidence of bias or partiality by Klafter, there is no reason to assume that Klafter's position as Assistant to the Provost, per se, would have rendered the proceedings unfair, even if Klafter, contrary to the evidence, had participated in decision-making. See Roland M. v. Concord Sch. Comm., 910 F.2d 983, 997-98 (1st Cir.1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 912, 111 S. Ct. 1122, 113 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1991); Greenberg v. Board of Governors of the Fed. Reserve Sys., 968 F.2d 164, 167-68 (2d Cir.1992) (although law clerk of administrative law judge had previously participated in investigation of case, judge not disqualified because law clerk played only ministerial role in adjudicatory process).[15]
There is a third problem with Motzkin's theory, but it relates only to one specific charge by Motzkin regarding Klafter's role. As he states in his affidavit, Klafter was dispatched by the Chairman of the Hearing Committee to interview a potential thirdparty *999 witness to determine whether the potential witness had any information that might be relevant to the pending charges. (Klafter Aff. ¶ 8.) Klafter, accompanied by an attorney from BU's Office of General Counsel and a student complainant, interviewed the witness for this purpose and tape-recorded the interview, without an expectation that the witness would be unavailable to attend the hearing. (Id.) As it turned out, the witness was on a work release program from a Massachusetts correctional institution. (Id.) By the time he was to testify, his work release status had been revoked, and he had been reincarcerated in the correctional institution. (Id.) Thus, he could not attend the hearing. (Garland Aff. ¶ 11.) The Hearing Committee offered Motzkin the option of convening the hearing at the correctional institution so that the witness's live testimony could be obtained, but Motzkin declined this offer. (Id.; Def.'s Resp.Ex. 2 at 2-3.) Consequently, the Hearing Committee decided to admit the tape-recorded interview, pursuant to clear Handbook authority. (Id.) Particularly where this decision was made only after Motzkin had declined an offer that would have enabled the witness to give live testimony and that would have fully preserved Motzkin's right of cross-examination, there was no deprivation of ""basic fairness."" See Cloud v. Trustees of Boston Univ., 720 F.2d 721, 725 (1st Cir.1983).
To summarize, because Motzkin concedes that he can be terminated for cause and is unfit to do the job he was hired to perform, his complaints about procedural unfairness of the process by which BU determined that cause for termination existed are immaterial. Even if his charges were material, there was no breach of contract because BU's procedures were fundamentally fair and in substantial compliance with those prescribed in the Handbook. For these reasons, I recommend that Count IV be dismissed. 
Count V
Count V of the amended complaint, entitled ""Wrongful Termination,"" consists of the following sentence: ""The University has wrongfully terminated the employment of Professor Motzkin."" (Am.Compl. ¶ 30.) Motzkin does not elaborate on or even mention this claim in any of his filings. BU reasonably assumes in its supplementary memorandum that this count purports to state a claim under cases such as Fortune v. National Cash Register Co., 373 Mass. 96, 364 N.E.2d 1251 (1977) and Gram v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 384 Mass. 659, 429 N.E.2d 21 (1981), which deal with the rights of at-will employees. As BU points out, however, Motzkin was not an at-will employee; he was an employee for a term of years who was terminated for cause. Moreover, there is no allegation that his termination was in violation of any public policy or in bad faith for the purpose of depriving him of compensation he had already earned. Therefore, the Fortune line of cases would seem to have no application here. Because there appears to be no other basis for a claim for ""wrongful termination,"" and because Motzkin has shed no light on the subject, I recommend dismissal of Count V. 
Count VI
Count VI of the amended complaint is entitled ""Estoppel"" and appears to assert that BU is estopped to terminate Motzkin because, among other reasons, it did not promptly commence disciplinary hearings at the first sign of a problem. (Am.Comp. ¶ 31.) This claim is clearly without merit. In order for there to be an estoppel, there must be some promise or representation by the party against whom the estoppel is asserted which induced reasonable, detrimental reliance by the person asserting the estoppel. Cadrin v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 828 F. Supp. 120, 122-23 (D.Mass.1993) (citations omitted); O'Blenes v. Zoning Bd. of Appeals, 397 Mass. 555, 492 N.E.2d 354, 356 (1986). Motzkin has neither pled any of these elements nor produced any evidence that BU made any promise or representation that Motzkin would not be held accountable for his alleged offensive behavior. To the contrary, on each occasion that BU became aware of a problem, it raised the matter with Motzkin and urged him to act appropriately. The fact that it did not bring formal charges against or formally reprimand him prior to 1993 is attributable to the unwillingness of any complainant to press formal charges until that time. (Def.'s Supplem.Mem. at 9.) *1000 Further, Motzkin cannot allege in good faith that he continued to engage in offensive conduct in reliance on the belief that BU had promised him or otherwise represented to him that he was free to do so. Finally, any reliance by Motzkin on such purported promise or representation that he could, with impunity, sexually harass students or sexually assault or harass faculty members would clearly be unreasonable as a matter of law. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. § 1681 (1994); Lipsett, 864 F.2d  at 896-901.
I therefore recommend that Count VI be dismissed. 
Count VII
Count VII, entitled ""Violation of Fair Process Rights in the Internal Hearing,"" (Am. Compl. ¶¶ 32-33), merely restates the complaints regarding alleged procedural flaws that were addressed above in the discussion of the breach of contract count, Count IV. For the reasons stated in the above section, those allegations are meritless. I therefore recommend that Count VII be dismissed. 
Count VIII
Count VIII is entitled ""Defamation,"" and consists solely of this sentence: ""The University defamed Plaintiff Motzkin and sought to cast him in a false light by filing as a public record in the Court confidential materials not subject to impoundment and by leaking distorted information to the press  all causing great harm to the reputation and privacy of Professor Motzkin.""[16] (Id. ¶ 34.)
To the extent that Motzkin seeks to allege a cause of action for defamation based upon BU's public filings with this court, such claim is barred by the absolute privilege applicable to statements made in the course of litigation, as long as the statements, as they do here, pertain to that litigation. E.g., Correllas v. Viveiros, 410 Mass. 314, 572 N.E.2d 7, 10 (1991) (""Statements made in the course of a judicial proceeding which pertain to that proceeding are, of course, absolutely privileged and cannot support a claim of defamation, even if uttered with malice or in bad faith"").[17] With respect to the ""false light"" claim, Massachusetts has declined repeated invitations to recognize this tort. See, e.g., ELM Medical Lab., Inc. v. RKO Gen., Inc., 403 Mass. 779, 532 N.E.2d 675, 681 (1989), modified by United Truck Leasing Corp. v. Geltman, 406 Mass. 811, 551 N.E.2d 20, 23 (1990). Even if it were now inclined to do so, the tort of invasion of privacy by casting someone in a false light would no doubt be subject to the absolute privilege applicable to statements made in the course of judicial proceedings that pertain to that proceeding. See Correllas, 572 N.E.2d  at 13 (claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress must fail if based on absolutely privileged statements, because ""[a] privilege which protected an individual from liability for defamation would be of little value if the individual were subject to liability under a different theory of tort"").
I therefore recommend that Count VIII be dismissed. 
III. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION
For all the foregoing reasons, I recommend that summary judgment be granted to *1001 BU on all eight counts of the amended complaint. 
IV. IMPORTANT NOTICE OF RIGHT TO OBJECT AND WAIVER OF RIGHT TO APPEAL FOR FAILURE TO DO SO WITHIN TEN DAYS
The parties are hereby advised that under the provisions of Rule 3(b) of the Rules for United States Magistrates in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, any party who objects to these proposed findings and recommendations must file a written objection thereto with the Clerk of this Court WITHIN 10 DAYS of the party's receipt of this Report and Recommendation. The written objections must specifically identify the portion of the proposed findings, recommendations, or report to which objection is made and the basis for such objections. The parties are further advised that the United States Court of Appeals for this Circuit has indicated that failure to comply with this rule shall preclude further appellate review by the Court of Appeals of the District Court's order entered pursuant to this Report and Recommendation. See United States v. Valencia-Copete, 792 F.2d 4 (1st Cir.1986); Park Motor Mart, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 616 F.2d 603 (1st Cir.1980); United States v. Vega, 678 F.2d 376 (1st Cir.1982); Scott v. Schweiker, 702 F.2d 13 (1st Cir.1983); see also Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 106 S. Ct. 466, 88 L. Ed. 2d 435 (1985).
NOTES
[1]  For reasons stated in a separate Memorandum and Order issued this date, Motzkin's related (but non-dispositive) motions for discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) and for leave to file a second amended complaint are denied.
[2]  By their terms, the CLA Policy and the Handbook policies and procedures are not mutually exclusive, and there is nothing in the record that suggests that they are. Therefore, BU could presumably have proceeded against Motzkin directly under the Handbook procedures, bypassing the CLA Policy entirely.
[3]  The Handbook neither states nor implies that the President has the right to substitute his or her findings for those of the committee or to recommend to the Trustees that a faculty member be disciplined in a case in which the committee, for whatever reason, did not make such recommendation. Further, it would not make sense in the context of the elaborate hearing structure mandated by the Handbook to find such right by implication. It thus appears that the President and, ultimately, the Trustees act in effect as a board of clemency, with power to reject the committee's recommendation, if any, that the faculty member be disciplined, but without independent authority to impose discipline if the committee has not made such recommendation. Although, for reasons discussed below, I need not reach the question in this case of the weight to be given to the committee's findings or the Trustees' decision, it should be noted that these procedures differ in material respects from those involved in McConnell v. Howard Univ., 818 F.2d 58, 62, 67-70 (D.C.Cir.1987) (because university board of trustees was not bound by decision of faculty hearing committee in favor of tenured faculty member, court declined to give any effect either to findings of hearing committee or to decision by board of trustees to overrule those findings and impose discipline).
[4]  In her opposition to the present motion, Motzkin's counsel states, ""Professor Motzkin, on advice of counsel, could not testify to define the factual disputes  leaving his factual story to be told in this lawsuit."" (Pl.'s Opp'n at 3 n. 5. (emphasis added).) No explanation is given and there appears to be no basis for the assertion that Motzkin ""could"" not testify. As discussed below, however, all this is immaterial in light of Motzkin's concession that he is unfit to teach.
[5]  Title III of the ADA deals with discrimination with respect to public accommodations. The original complaint did not include a claim under Title I, which deals with employment discrimination.
[6]  The eight counts were as follows: discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of Title I of the ADA (Count I), of the Rehabilitation Act (Count II), and of Title III of the ADA (Count III); breach of contract (Count IV); wrongful termination (Count V); estoppel (Count VI); violation of fair process rights in the internal termination hearing (Count VII); and defamation (Count VIII).
[7]  Motzkin's amended complaint does not include a claim under state law for discrimination on the basis of disability.
[8]  Because the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act contain similar language, courts have applied decisions based on the Rehabilitation Act to interpret the ADA. Larkins v. CIBA Vision Corp., 858 F. Supp. 1572, 1583 n. 4 (N.D.Ga.1994); see also Parker v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 875 F. Supp. 1321, 1325 (W.D.Tenn.1995) (ADA case noting that analysis under prior Rehabilitation Act case is instructive because ADA provisions are to be construed consistently with similar Rehabilitation Act requirements).
[9]  The court expresses no opinion about whether teaching is an ""essential function"" of even non-specially appointed faculty members, other than to say that it would be surprising if it were not.
[10]  Motzkin contends, and BU does not deny, that BU is a place of public accommodation. See 42 U.S.C. § 12181(7) (J) (including undergraduate and postgraduate schools and other places of education as public accommodations, provided that their operations affect commerce).
[11]  In addition, the Regulations to Implement the Equal Employment Provisions of the ADA specifically state that their purpose is ""to implement title I of the [ADA], requiring equal employment opportunities for qualified individuals with disabilities,"" and several other ADA sections, none of which sections is located in Title III. See 29 C.F.R. § 1630.1(a).
[12]  In fact, Motzkin concedes, as he must, that his incorporation claim must fail if his ADA claims lack merit. (Tr. at 64-65.) Since I have concluded for reasons already stated that Motzkin's ADA claims lack merit, I will give no further consideration to this aspect of Motzkin's breach of contract claim.
[13]  As noted, the Provost gave Motzkin an additional fourteen days to respond to the faculty member's complaint, and Motzkin does not contend that this was inadequate. Nor does Motzkin suggest that the  hoc committee's failure to consider the faculty member's complaint deprived him of an opportunity to settle it before the Hearing Committee considered it. Indeed, Motzkin could have attempted to settle that complaint in the additional fourteen days afforded to him for preparation.
[14]  One of Motzkin's motions for discovery pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(f) sought discovery regarding Klafter's role. (Docket no. 28.) For reasons set forth in a separate Memorandum and Order issued this date, this motion is denied.
[15]  As BU has pointed out, all the faculty members on the Hearing Committee were themselves employees of BU, and, in that sense, they would all equally be vulnerable to the charge that they might be subject to undue influence. In the absence of any evidence that BU might have attempted to exert undue influence or that any member of the Hearing Committee might have succumbed to it or was otherwise biased, the faculty members' employee status, per se, would surely not be a basis for disqualification. See Greenberg, 968 F.2d  at 167 (fact that administrative law judges are employees of agency whose actions they review is not a basis for disqualification). If it were, a procedure that was clearly designed to protect the accused faculty member by inserting a committee of his or her peers as a buffer between him or her and the administration could never serve its beneficial purpose.
[16]  Count VIII is the subject of Motzkin's motion to amend. By separate Memorandum and Order entered this date, Motzkin's motion is denied.
[17]  Motzkin did not move to place the allegedly offending materials under seal. Had he done so, it is unlikely that the court would have granted such motion, assuming that it even would have had any discretion in the matter. See Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 805 F.2d 1, 11 (1st Cir.1986) (suggesting that there may be a ""right of public access to documents considered in rulings on dispositive pretrial motions,"" and citing Second and Seventh Circuit decisions recognizing such right). In any event, despite Motzkin's unsubstantiated claims to the contrary, the information was surely not confidential, since (1) the Handbook expressly provides that ""[a]nnouncement of the Trustees' final decision shall include a statement of the Hearing Committee's findings, if this has not previously been made known"" (Handbook at 69), and (2) this Report and Recommendation, which necessarily includes a statement of the reasons for my recommendation, is and must be a public document. In addition, before BU filed the allegedly offending materials, one of the complaining students disclosed detailed information to the press, (Klafter Aff. ¶¶ 14-16), and Motzkin himself gave a detailed account of the situation from his perspective to an Israeli news reporter for publication in an Israeli news magazine. (Def.'s Resp.Ex. 5: Elswit Aff. ¶¶ 7-8 and attached article dated 4/2/95, the title of which was translated as ""I Kept My Hands to Myself."")

"
https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/20/boston-u-moves-terminate-professor-after-investigation-sexual-harassment-claims,"Boston University said Friday that it found evidence of harassment in a case involving David Marchant, a well-known geologist -- enough to initiate termination proceedings against him.
Marchant, who was until recently chair of the department of earth and environment at Boston, remains a professor but is now on paid administrative leave, Provost Jean Morrison said in a statement. The university’s 13-month investigation was prompted by claims of harassment by one of Marchant’s former graduate students but involved interviews and statements from more than 30 witnesses and some 1,000 pages of records.
Many details of the case have since become public, due to media coverage. The matter is also the subject of a separate investigation by the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Science, Space and Technology.
Marchant’s primary accuser is Jane Willenbring, now an associate professor of geology at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. She says that Marchant harassed her during a 1999 research trip to Antarctica, when he was still an assistant professor at Boston. Marchant allegedly pressured Willenbring to have sex with his brother, who was also on the trip, and called her a ""slut"" and a ""whore."" Willenbring also says Marchant pelted her with rocks while she was urinating outside and purposely blew volcanic ash into her eyes as she was recovering from a condition known as ice blindness.
Other witnesses have publicly corroborated some of Willenbring’s account and, in two cases, reported similar experiences during field research with Marchant.
Boston investigators concluded that Marchant engaged in sexual harassment in violation of the university’s policies on sexual harassment and equal opportunity. Specifically, investigators found, “by a preponderance of the evidence, that Marchant directed derogatory sex-based slurs and sexual comments at Willenbring during the 1999-2000 field expedition to Antarctica,” Morrison said. Investigators did not find credible evidence to support Willenbring’s remaining allegations of “direct physical attacks and other types of psychological and physical abuse,” however, she said.
Over all, Boston found the sexual harassment “was sufficiently severe and pervasive so as to create a hostile learning and living environment for Willenbring” in Antarctica.
“We take all complaints of sexual harassment very seriously and will always be vigilant in conducting a thorough, fair and effective investigation,” Morrison said. “We are committed to creating an environment for all members of the university community that is free from sexual harassment.”
Marchant, who has not commented publicly on the case and did not respond to a request from Inside Higher Ed about the university’s findings, has been notified of his right to appeal. Science reported that he denied the allegations against him during the university's investigation.
Willenbring has said that she waited until she gained tenure to report Marchant, for fear of possible professional retribution. Hers is among a group of recent harassment claims against professors involving older incidents -- some inspired by the allegations against movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and others not. Boston’s response is significant in that it signals professors will still be held accountable for misconduct, regardless of timeline. The case also highlights the particular challenges faced by those who experience harassment or assault at scientific field sites, which are often geographically remote and lack clear standards of conduct and reporting procedures.
Willenbring said Saturday that she was “pleased that the truth of many women’s experiences was heard and believed.” Even though the university didn’t find credible evidence of physical misconduct, she added, it’s “clear from the report that he still discriminates based on gender and sexually harasses some women.”
Boston’s investigation under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, prohibiting gender discrimination in education, indicates Boston’s “future commitment to students’ well-being,” she said. “Common sense prevailed in their determination that he sexually harassed me.”

A practice room in the Boston University School of Music. A second Boston University student anonymously revealed to The Daily Free Press evidence of inappropriate messaging on a dating app from College of Fine Arts professor Eric Ruske. SHANNON DAMIANO/ DAILY FREE PRESS STAFF
A current student at Boston University who asked to remain anonymous said College of Fine Arts professor of music and horn performance Eric Ruske engaged in a conversation with them on the dating app Tinder in early May.
The student said they found Ruske on the app in May after raising their preferred age range to above 50 as a joke, similar to another student who interacted with the professor on the dating app Bumble.
Screenshots obtained by The Daily Free Press show Ruske’s and the student’s verified Tinder profiles, as well as their conversation within the app dated May 5.
In contrast to the previous instance, Ruske’s Tinder profile does not identify himself as a BU professor — only several photos, his first name, his age listed as 58, physical distance from the student and sexual orientation. The student’s profile displays they are 19 and that they’re at BU. 
The student said they were not initially aware Ruske was a CFA professor, but figured it out after conducting a Google search. 
The student said the fact that Ruske is pursuing 19-year-old students who attend the University he works at is “highly inappropriate.”
“He’s teaching undergraduate students and he knowingly messaged me with Boston University being in my bio,” they said, “so it wasn’t like it was a big secret that I’m an undergraduate at BU.”
Ruske did not respond to request for comment. BU spokesperson Colin Riley declined to comment.
Screenshots of the conversation show Ruske wrote he does not do pick-up lines in response to the student’s bio, which asks for good pick up lines.
“We boys just aren’t terribly f—— creative, are we?” his message reads with a grinning face with smiling eyes emoji, according to the screenshot. “Too easily distracted by shiny things…and big boobs.”
CFA students shared mixed opinions on the professor. Some said Ruske has never made them uncomfortable, while others noted the interactions form a concerning pattern.
Jessica Young, a CFA doctoral student studying French horn, said Ruske has never made inappropriate comments or made her feel uncomfortable in the five years she has been his student.
“He’s one of the only people I’ve ever studied with, and I’ve taken many trial lessons, who has never discredited the fact that I was a woman,” Young said. “I came here because he has the same high standards for every single person in the studio, and that’s what keeps us getting better.”
Young added many horn students choose BU because they have studied with one of Ruske’s past students. 
She said she was present at the University during part of the sexual misconduct trial between Ruske and his former students, adding that while reports and articles about the trial gave her some pause, her experience with him has been largely positive.
“It was just annoying to see people just deciding to attack him for never seeing him, never meeting him, never standing in the same room with him,” Young said. “It seems so simple in these articles that this guy is a bad guy and he’s only here to f— all the women, but honestly he’s there to teach us how to be better horn players.” 
Young said she believes Ruske’s interactions with the BU student on Bumble were consensual, given “it is a dating app.”
“It’s just frustrating that one thing that has potentially nothing to do with even a CFA student … is bringing him back into potentially getting fired,” she said. “There is no part of me that can go to this school without him.”
Reyna Flores, a senior in CFA and the College of Arts and Sciences, called Ruske’s interactions with students through dating apps “extemely concerning” and said she found them to constitute sexual harassment.
“If he’s your professor, it’s extremely unprofessional and so inappropriate to be pursuing your students at the school that you work at,” Flores said.
As a violin performance major in the School of Music, Flores said she doesn’t see much of Ruske save in hallways and streets, but said one of her closest friends, a French horn major and student of Ruske, has shared her experiences. 
“She describes them in a casual way and brushing them off, but to me it’s pretty alarming to hear,” Flores said. “I remember being really shocked when my friend told me that he made some crude gestures toward her and insinuated that she had large boobs.”
CAS senior Ilana Balog said having taken a class with Ruske her freshman year, Ruske never made her uncomfortable, and that she generally does not hold a bad opinion of him.
“I think that these [incidents] are definitely something that needs to be taken in consideration with regard to my opinion of him,” she said, “but I wouldn’t say he was overly making everybody uncomfortable.”
During that studio horn class she took freshman year, Balog said, Ruske had a “very intense” energy in the classroom and would often speak with “no filter,” making some students a bit uncomfortable.
She said she thinks the University has taken little disciplinary action toward Ruske because of his skill as a musician and professor.
“I think that the school is overlooking everything because they feel like he’s so valuable,” Balog said, “because he’s so talented and such a good professor and produces really good students.”
CFA Dean Harvey Young and Associate Dean Ruthie Jean did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Flores said she hopes disciplinary action is taken toward Ruske, adding the current situation is not “something you can just brush under the rug.” 
“Especially for my colleagues, I hope that something happens,” Flores said. “I hope that it’s not just a slap on the wrist, and I definitely hope that he’s punished for his actions because it makes it a toxic learning environment.”

https://www.eastidahonews.com/2017/07/woman-suing-byu-idaho-widow-alleged-sexual-assault-now-deceased-professor/," REXBURG — A former Brigham Young University-Idaho student claims she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a now-deceased professor between 2014 and 2016.  The female student, whom EastIdahoNews.com has chosen not to identify, filed a Title IX lawsuit against BYU-Idaho in federal court. Title IX bars sexual discrimination on campus and ensures that every university and college receiving money from the federal government investigates and resolves complaints of sexual violence. In the 27-page lawsuit, the woman, who is disabled, alleges that Stephen Stokes, a sociology professor, intentionally targeted her as a “vulnerable person whom he could groom for a sexual relationship.” Stokes is accused of using “his knowledge of (the woman’s) disabilities to coerce (her) into an unwelcomed and unwanted sexual relationship.” The lawsuit asserts at least five school officials were aware of the abuse, but it was not reported to the Title IX coordinator for investigation.  The university and Stokes’ wife, Susan, are listed as defendants in the case. They adamantly deny the allegations.  Both sides are demanding a jury trial to state their arguments.  This case was filed amidst changes to the Title IX policies at BYU-Idaho and other educational facilities owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The changes aims to “encourage the reporting of sexual misconduct” by giving victims or witnesses of sexual assault guarantees of confidentiality, amnesty and leniency.    Stephen Stokes was never accused or charged of any sex crime in Idaho during his life. He died in July 2016 due to complications from heart surgery. Stokes was a “beloved professor” who was missed by faculty and students, according to the BYU-Idaho Scroll. The lawsuit was filed five months after his death and amended in March. THE ALLEGATIONS In the complaint, the woman is described as being disabled due to a number of mental illnesses, including post traumatic stress disorder, agoraphobia, severe anxiety, panic disorder, anorexia and Stockholm syndrome. Her disabilities allowed her to obtain disability accommodations from the school. Court records indicate the woman met Stokes in 2014 at BYU-Idaho. The two developed a friendship after she discovered Stokes had known her deceased father.  Stokes is said to have encouraged her to join the social work program and promised he would become her faculty advisor. Stokes allegedly took a heightened interest in her and when she joined the program, she told him about her mental issues.   The woman also confided to Stokes that she was experiencing financial problems as a single mother. Stokes arranged for her to get food from the food bank and advocated on her behalf at BYU-Idaho.  The woman asserts her contact with Stokes became more frequent and he confessed to her that he was experiencing marital problems.  He is said to have mentioned that God brought the two of them together. “Stokes told her that Heavenly Father placed her in his life for a reason and that (Stokes was) supposed to show her what it feels like to be cared for … and that God had revealed her goodness to him and that he had been given the sacred privilege to help her,” court documents state.  The woman claims the relationship escalated to hugging in his office and then to physical massage or “spinal touch” sessions to help her relieve severe anxiety. In court documents, she alleges the touching made her anxiousness worse.   In the fall of 2014, court documents state one of the spinal touch sessions ended with sexual activity. Afterward she said it became a regular part of their interaction, and Stokes used God and religion on multiple occasions to justify sexual advances.  In January 2015, the woman took a job as his teaching assistant and she claims Stokes indicated he wanted a more permanent relationship.  “During her employment, (Stokes) continued to insist on providing ‘therapeutic’ rubbing and touching to ‘assist’ (her) in managing her anxiety,” court documents show. “To the contrary, her anxiety became unmanageable at this time.” She saw doctors 14 times between January 2015 and July 2016 to get medication for anxiety or panic attacks exacerbated “by Stokes’ aggressive harassment, stalking and sexual assault and battery,” according to court documents.  Between April 2015 to July 2016, she says, that sexual contact occurred at least three times per week in BYU-Idaho parking lots, classrooms, a campus greenhouse and at her home.  She began to skip school to avoid Stokes, but she said he would show up at her house, at church and at family events. He is said to have told her that “he was her loving husband sent by God.” “(She) wanted to end this harmful relationship, but felt trapped. Stokes had been so kind to (her) as a father figure when they first met, but she wanted nothing to do with his sexual advances and obsession with her as his ‘wife,'” documents show. “She came to believe if she ended the relationship Stokes would retaliate against her and ensure she could not complete her degree.” The woman told a friend and fellow social work student about the relationship. The friend advised that she report Stokes to university officials. The friend also told a school counselor at the BYU-Idaho Counseling Center about the relationship and said she was going to report Stokes.  The plaintiff claims Stokes found out about the friend. He threatened to cancel the friend’s internship if she “continued to meddle in their relationship,” the plaintiff said. Stokes came up with a plan to tell administrators about the relationship, “but to explain their relationship in a way that would not point to any misconduct on Stokes’ part,” the plaintiff said. The woman and the friend spoke with department administrators, according to court documents. The woman initially disclosed that she was in a relationship with Stokes that involved “kissing and leg rubbing,” but was not sexual. She is said to have also told administrators that Stokes had “taken over her life.”  Department leaders met with Stokes to discuss the allegations. “After a matter of minutes Stokes exited the room smiling triumphantly and reported to (the woman) that everything was fine and thanked her for ‘saving him,'” court documents state.  The next day Stokes received a letter of reprimand from the department chair for having an inappropriate relationship with a student and he was advised to stop to avoid further disciplinary action, according to the lawsuit. No other action was taken.  The woman claims even after the reprimand, Stokes “continued to regularly sexually assault and batter (her) on the BYU-Idaho campus and in her home.” Stokes is said to have called and texted the woman up to the time he died on July 1, 2016.    Later, the woman was put on academic suspension for poor grades. She said it was due to missed classes from trying to avoid Stokes and from anxiety that came with the relationship.  She also said due to the lawsuit, she was denied an ecclesiastical endorsement, which is needed to attend BYU-Idaho. Stephen Stokes | BYU-Idaho Scroll BACKGROUND This federal lawsuit against BYU-Idaho is not the first legal action taken by the female plaintiff against the Stokes estate. In October 2016, the woman filed a claim in Madison County against the estate of Stephen Stokes in excess of $1 million. She was claiming damages for sexual assault, sexual battery, and infliction of negligent and intentional emotional stress. Her attorney said that the case is still active and is pending the results of the federal case.  CLAIM FOR DAMAGES The woman is being represented by Holden, Kidwell Hahn & Crapo in Idaho Falls. When asked about their client, the law firm issued the following statement:  “In spite of the tragic events (the plaintiff) endured from a trusted professor, she is, and intends to remain, a faithful member of the Mormon church. Unfortunately, (her) disabilities make her extremely vulnerable to manipulation and abuse, which she was not prepared to encounter on the campus of BYU-Idaho.”  The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages from BYU-Idaho and the Stokes estate on seven counts:   That BYU-Idaho was a hostile work environment where the plaintiff was sexually harassed and that although the harassment was reported to administrators, no one took corrective measures on her behalf or reported the conduct to the Title IX coordinator as per BYU-Idaho’s Sexual Misconduct Policy. The plaintiff was subjected to teacher-on-student sexual harassment based on the fact Stokes had the power to harm the plaintiff’s ability to complete her education. Also that BYU-Idaho acted with indifference to the abuse and discrimination and as a result the woman continues to suffer emotional distress and humiliation. That the school violated the Americans with Disabilities Act because Stokes knew about her disabilities and proceeded to take advantage of her with unwanted sexual advances. That BYU-Idaho violated the Human Rights Act because Stokes, her superior when she was his teaching assistant, discriminated against her based on gender. The plaintiff claims that Susan Stokes, a representative of her husband’s estate, is liable for the intentional infliction of emotional distress and for Stephen Stokes’ treatment of the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims Susan Stokes is also liable for negligent infliction of emotional distress because Stephen Stokes was aware he was in breach of a standard of conduct.  That Stephen Stokes did sexually assault and batter the woman despite her repeated protests and that he used her vulnerabilities to force her into a sexual relationship.  BYU-IDAHO’S RESPONSE With few exceptions, BYU-Idaho and Susan Stokes adamantly deny the allegations made against them by the plaintiff. They imply her story of a sexual relationship with Stokes was made up only after his death.  BYU-Idaho spokesman Brett Crandall issued the following statement about the case: “Brigham Young University-Idaho is committed to promoting and maintaining a safe and respectful environment for the campus community. It is the university’s policy to take immediate and appropriate steps to stop sexual harassment, prevent any recurrence and address its effects. BYU-Idaho confirms it has reviewed allegations of sexual harassment concerning a former employee who passed away in July 2016. The university was unaware of these allegations prior to the employee’s death and is confident it has acted appropriately. Moreover, the university is not aware of any violations of state or federal law. In its court submissions, BYU-Idaho has responded to the lawsuit’s specific allegations and is confident the legal system will determine the truth of this case and will act accordingly.” BYU-Idaho and Susan Stokes are being represented by Boise law firm Andersen, Schwartzman, Woodard and Brailsford. In its rebuttal to the lawsuit, the university denies discriminating against the plaintiff. BYU-Idaho also says administrators had no knowledge of any harassment or abuse.  “When plaintiff met with BYU-I before Stokes’ death, she did not reveal a physical or romantic relationship. Contrary to (her complaint), she did not mention any harassment or abuse,” according to a university statement in court records. Instead, BYU-Idaho claims Stokes’ interactions with the plaintiff were limited to emotional and financial support. “It was not until after Stokes’ death that plaintiff indicated she had a consensual romantic relationship with Stokes. Then months after Stokes’ death and after hiring an attorney and demanding significant sums of money, plaintiff changed her story to claim harassment and abuse,” the statement reads.   The university admits Stokes did help the plaintiff pay for groceries, medication and helped her in a legal matter. But it denies the woman ever told any administrator that there was a physical or romantic relationship with Stokes. BYU-Idaho also asserts the plaintiff’s friend denied knowing anything about a physical relationship between her and Stokes.  EastIdahoNews.com reached out to the friend for comment but has not received a response.  The university said it sent a letter to Stokes directing him to cease all non-academic interactions with the plaintiff. However, nothing reported to BYU-Idaho at the time required a Title IX investigation because all involved said there had been no discrimination or harassment, according to the university.  BYU-Idaho said the plaintiff told several individuals about a consensual romantic relationship after Stokes’ death. Upon hearing those rumors, the Title IX coordinator reached out to the plaintiff multiple times, but she did not meet with him.  BYU-Idaho claims it exercised reasonable care to protect the plaintiff and that it did not know about Stokes’ alleged conduct. The university denies it discriminated against her based on her gender or disability or that she suffered any damages as a result of its actions. The lawsuit is currently in the discovery phase. No trial date has been set.  "
http://nypost.com/2007/02/07/pervy-prof-is-busted/,"
 A hands-on biology professor has been busted for giving personal anatomy lessons to two female students, police sources said yesterday. 
  Sikdar Masood, 49, fondled the women while teaching at Brooklyn College and the Franklin Career Institute, a Brooklyn trade school, the sources said. 
  “He grabbed my left breast with his right hand. I didn’t know what to do. I left the class crying,” the Franklin Institute victim told The Post. 
  The Brooklyn College victim said, “He was very practiced and slick.” 
  Police sources said the frisky-fingered prof was demonstrating anatomy by pointing to parts of the body of a 25-year-old female student. 
  When the class ended, he told the student to go into the office, where – to her shock – he began fondling her breasts, the sources said. 
  Then he touched her waist and buttocks and told her, “You are so pretty. You don’t have to worry about [passing] this class.” 
  A friend encouraged the young woman to call cops and Masood was busted that night on sexual-abuse and harassment charges. 
  “I’m sure a lot of girls have given him leeway for an easy ‘A,’ ” his victim said. “I don’t think he should be teaching at any college. He should definitely go to jail.” 
  The Post is withholding the victims’ names due to the nature of the alleged crimes. 
  Masood’s wife, Laila, 35, rejected the charges, saying the two women were trying to harass her husband for being too tough a teacher. 
  “I know my husband. He’s strict, but he’s honest,” she said at their Jamaica home. 
  Masood, who trained as a doctor in his native Bangladesh, was fired from Brooklyn College and no longer works at the Franklin Career Institute. 
  The latest incident occurred after a Brooklyn College anatomy class on Sept. 25. 
  Masood was fired on Oct. 11 after an internal investigation, a college spokesman said. 
  The Brooklyn District Attorney’s Office subsequently ran a background check and found a letter from a former student in Masood’s Franklin Career Institute file. 
  The student, also a 25-year-old woman, claimed that on Nov. 1, 2005, after a class on taking a patient’s blood, the pervy prof had students fill out some papers. 
  When the woman handed hers in, Masood squeezed her breast and whispered, “Good job,” the sources said.

http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/social-affairs/20170606/cabrillo-professor-sued-for-sexual-assault-college-sued-for-title-ix-violations,"APTOS >> A former student and teacher’s aide has filed a lawsuit against Cabrillo College and a member of its faculty, alleging the professor repeatedly sexually harassed her and committed sexual assault and sexual battery in May 2016.
The professor, Alex Taurke, has taught math at Cabrillo College since 1994. During that time, Taurke only received one training session related to sexual harassment awareness and prevention, according to the May 18, 2017 complaint
At the time of the alleged incidents, the student was an undergraduate math major and enrolled in Taurke’s calculus class. Under the professor’s guidance, she worked as a tutor in the Math Learning Center, eventually becoming his aide.
The complaint alleges Taurke sexually harassed the student throughout the spring semester, including closing blinds to “ensure privacy” during office meetings; moving his chair close to the student’s chair; placing his knees around hers so their knees and thighs would touch; and caressing and stroking the side of the student’s face, head and legs.
Many of the student’s colleagues and friends witnessed the interactions, causing further humiliation, according to the complaint.
When the student filed a grievance with Cabrillo College, she found the proper reporting procedure unclear and the necessary documents inaccessible to students, the complaint reads.
In addition, the complaint alleges that Cabrillo College has never complied with its Title IX obligations nor employed a permanent and designated Title IX coordinator.
By failing to provide sufficient sexual harassment faculty and staff training management, Cabrillo College failed to protect the student, according to the complaint.
After being unable to contact the Title IX coordinator at Cabrillo College, the student was directed to a male athletic coach with whom the student felt uncomfortable speaking. As a result, the student submitted a grievance against Cabrillo College with the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights on May 25, 2016. 
In the course of the ensuing investigation, the Office for Civil Rights determined that Cabrillo College “did not and never had” a permanent and designated Title IX coordinator. 
During the interview, Taurke admitted to the Office for Civil Rights that he had made the statements to the student and realized the statements constituted sexual harassment, according to the complaint.
In addition, Cabrillo College officials admitted to inadequacies in its Title IX policy obligations as well as Title IX notification, reporting, monitoring and training requirements, according to the complaint.
Cabrillo College spokeswoman Kristin Fabos confirmed that the Office for Civil Rights complaint had been filed and investigated. 
A Dec. 21, 2016 resolution agreement posted on the Office for Civil Rights website contains an extensive list of required revisions to Cabrillo College’s Title IX procedures and policies. It includes mandatory staff and student trainings as well as remedies to its reporting process.
Fabos also confirmed that the student had filed the lawsuit.
“It is now a legal matter as well as a personnel matter,” said Fabos.
Although Fabos went on to confirm that Taurke remains employed by Cabrillo College, she said the college would not comment further on the lawsuit at this time. He is also listed as scheduled to teach multiple courses in Fall 2017.
The student is represented by John Kristensen of Kristensen Weisberg LLP, a Los Angeles-based law firm, who won a $1.15 million sexual assault settlement from the University of California Regents in January. That claim centered on allegations that a UC Santa Cruz student was sexually assaulted on June 13, 2015 by one of her professors.
Kristensen is in trial this week and unavailable to comment on the more recent Cabrillo College case, according to a representative of his law firm.
Prior to the start of the Fall 2016 academic semester, the student quit her job with Taurke as a teacher’s aide because the potential of seeing or interacting with Taurke made her feel “anxious, nervous and uneasy.”

https://www.santacruzsentinel.com/2018/03/06/cabrillo-settles-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-for-350000/,"APTOS >> A sexual harassment lawsuit brought against Cabrillo College and one of its instructors ended with the college agreeing to pay a former student $350,000.
Approval of the settlement was announced Monday night by the Cabrillo Governing Board, according to Cabrillo College President Matt Wetstein. 
“This brings to a closure all litigation surrounding a claim of sexual harassment that was filed by a former student,” Wetstein said in a statement to the Sentinel.
The college agreed to pay $115,000 to the former student out of its own coffers, with the remainder of the $350,000 stemming from insurance funds, according to Wetstein. The settlement, Wetstein emphasized, is not an admission of liability. 
A female former student and teachers aide filed the suit in May, alleging the math instructor Alex Taurke repeatedly harassed, sexually assaulted and sexually battered her in May 2016. The woman was enrolled in Taurke’s calculus class and also served as his teacher’s aide during the time of the alleged incidents.
The suit accused Cabrillo of failing to comply with Title IX, a federal civil rights law prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sex. The complaint alleged Cabrillo failed to provide Taurke with adequate sexual harassment training and did not have a clear pathway to report harassment. The former student claimed she repeatedly tried to report the alleged harassment but was so stymied she eventually turned to the federal Office of Civil Rights. That office began its own investigation, which concluded in January 2017 that Cabrillo had violated Title IX with respect to its “notice, policies and procedures” and that the student was subjected to “unwanted touching and comments by a faculty member, which created a hostile environment on the basis of sex.” 
As a result, Cabrillo agreed to overhaul its harassment policies and procedures to include annual training and clear reporting mechanisms, and has since hired a full-time Title IX coordinator and compliance officer. 
A federal judge granted Cabrillo’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit in September, but gave the student leave to amend the complaint and re-file, which she did on Oct. 20.
Due to the “nature of the settlement and the personnel issues involved,” Wetstein said he was unable to provide further comment about the cause.
“However, I can say that we have strengthened our processes around Title IX and sexual harassment training and as an institution of higher education we take responsibility for ensuring that our learning and working environments are safe, free of harassment, and open to all who can benefit from educational advancement,” he said.”
Cabrillo spokeswoman Kristin Fabos declined to comment on any internal discipline proceedings and Taurke’s continued role in the college, calling the matter an “ongoing personnel issue.”
The law firm representing the former student, Kristensen Weisberg LLP, won a $1.15 million settlement from UC Santa Cruz in 2017, alleging sexual assault by a UCSC professor who is now terminated.
Attorneys representing the former student did not respond to requests for comment by press time, nor did attorneys representing Taurke or Taurke himself.

Cal Poly professor accused of looking up professor’s dress
June 18, 2018  

Jason Alan Williams

A Cal Poly psychology professor whose research field includes covert communication allegedly used his phone to look up a female professor’s dress. [KSBY]
The incident occurred on May 2 in a faculty office building, university officials say. Cal Poly police arrested Jason Alan Williams, 52, shortly after the incident.
Last week, San Luis Obispo County prosecutors charged Williams with a misdemeanor count of peeping with a concealed device with intent to arouse. Williams faces up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted.
Williams is an associate professor in the psychology and child development, according to the Cal Poly website. He has taught at Cal Poly since 2008, according to his resume.
Courses Williams has taught at the university include general psychology, research methods and memory and cognition.
Williams’ research interests include nonverbal and covert communication, including eye movements and the role of emotion in these processes. He is also interested in researching the role of emotion on electronic communication, according to the university website.
University officials say Williams was not teaching at Cal Poly during the spring quarter. Officials have not said whether the university is taking administrative action against the professor.

https://mustangnews.net/psychology-professor-sentenced-to-five-years-probation-more-than-a-year-after-taking-photos-up-a-colleagues-skirt/,"
Cal Poly psychology and child development professor Jason Williams was sentenced to five years of probation and fined $221 for using his cell phone to take photos up a colleague’s skirt in May 2018.
Court documents show officials have the right to search through the defendant’s electronic devices and his residence. He was also served a protective order mandating that he cannot be within 50 yards of Cal Poly lecturer Kendra Williams. Jason and Kendra are not related. 
The defendant pleaded no contest to the misdemeanor charge, according to court documents.
The sentencing was postponed four times since the complaint against Jason was filed. Kendra gave an impact statement in court Monday morning, saying the current Title IX policies and procedures are “not enough.”
When Kendra returned as a lecturer the following academic year after the incident, she was reportedly told by Cal Poly not to speak about the incident.
During times when she would need to appear in court for multiple days throughout the quarter or when she would feel triggered during lectures about sexual relationships, she said she would have to tell her students it was “a personal matter.”
“[Cal Poly was] using Title IX to limit my speech and save face,” Kendra Williams said during her impact statement.
The licensed marriage and family therapist also addressed President Jeffrey Armstrong in her impact statement about the alleged mishandling of her investigation, which she said limited the charges the San Luis Obispo County District Attorney could bring against the perpetrator.
“Cal Poly is aware of Jason Williams’ plea agreement reached today,” University SPokesperson Matt Lazier wrote in an email to Mustang News. “The university issued a notice of discipline to Mr. Williams on May 8 of this year. He is currently suspended pending outcome of the disciplinary process, and we have no additional details to provide at this time.” 
Lazier declined to answer whether or not Williams is receiving pay while on suspension. He also did not provide any addition information about the disciplinary process when asked. 
According to Transparent California databases, Jason made more than $85,000 in the 2018 academic year. Data for the 2019 academic year is not yet included in the database. 
Kendra said she hopes the defendant loses his position as a tenured Cal Poly professor.
Days before her appearance in court Monday, Kendra said she invited Armstrong to the sentencing via email. Instead, he sent a representative on his behalf.
Kendra said her husband, two children, friends and department staff supported her throughout the course of the Title IX investigation.

The incident reportedly occurred around 10 a.m. May 2, 2018.
Kendra said Jason stood behind her in the department mailroom and initiated small talk with her.
She had her back to him as she checked her mail, when she said she felt something touch the inside of her right leg.
Upon looking down, Kendra said she saw Jason pointing his cell phone up her skirt and taking photos of her body with the flash on.
She said she confronted her colleague after seeing him upskirting her.
“You didn’t expect to have a woman, who you thought of as only an object, turn back into a woman and challenge you,” Kendra said to Jason in court.
She said this incident was not his first attempt, nor was she his only victim. The names of other potential victims that Kendra referred to are unknown.
Kendra said the defendant pretended to tie his shoes at the time of his prior attempt.
After the sexual harassment was reported, Kendra was placed on medical leave and Jason was booked into San Luis Obispo County Jail, according to an article from The Tribune. He was released from custody that same day, according to the article.
Kendra said she experienced symptoms of acute stress disorder for weeks following the incident, including feeling startled when her husband would enter the same room as her or being triggered when she would lecture about topics relating to sexual relationships.
“I did have times where I would have to skip through a couple of slides in a lecture and just take some time to breathe to get back in a position where I could keep teaching,” Kendra said in an interview with Mustang News.
Advocating for survivors of sexual assault and harassment
Kendra said she respects sexual assault survivors who choose not to be outspoken about their experiences, but is sharing her story to incite change and inspire other survivors to come forward.
“By not putting my voice and my story and my face out there, that allows [Jason] to stay more protected instead of protecting me,” Kendra said.
The total number of sexual assaults at Cal Poly jumped by 50 percent between the years 2015 and 2017, according to previous Mustang News coverage.
According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), only 23 percent of sexual assaults are reported to the police.
Mustang News reached out to the current Title IX Coordinator for Cal Poly. She was not available for comment.

The San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office charged former bioresource and agricultural engineering (BRAE) professor Shaun Kelly with a misdemeanor of indecent exposure. The San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office charged former bioresource and agricultural engineering (BRAE) professor Shaun Kelly with a misdemeanor of indecent exposure.

The San Luis Obispo District Attorney’s Office charged former bioresource and agricultural engineering (BRAE) professor Shaun Kelly with a misdemeanor of indecent exposure after witnesses claimed he flashed his genitals in the library this past year.
On May 27, 2012,the University Police Department (UPD) was called to the Robert E. Kennedy Library, UPD Chief George Hughes said.
The officers arrived on the scene and immediately began interviewing potential witnesses and victims, Hughes said. From the information gathered they were able to identify Kelly as a potential suspect, he said.
“We interviewed Mr. Kelly and at that time we didn’t have enough probable cause to make a physical arrest,” he said.
The case was then forwarded from the UPD to the District Attorney’s Office. Once the office reviewed the case, it filed charges on Kelly, Hughes said. The DA was not available for comment.
Cal Poly legal counsel Carlos Cordova wrote in an email to Mustang Daily that UPD informed Kelly he should not return to campus.
Cal Poly immediately investigated the circumstances surrounding the allegation and served Kelly with a Notice of Pending Disciplinary Action-Dismissal on June 14, 2012, Cordova wrote.
“This is the quickest I have seen a discipline served on a faculty member in the 24 years I have worked for CSU,” he wrote.
Kelly’s teaching assignments were covered by other faculty members and the proposed date for his dismissal was Sept. 10, 2012.
However, a collective bargaining agreement provision between CSU and the California Faculty Association prohibited Cal Poly from imposing the disciplinary sanction until the arbitrator heard the case. The hearing was scheduled for Tuesday, but was cancelled when Kelly submitted a letter to Cal Poly stating he was resigning his employment and withdrawing his request for an arbitration hearing.
Kelly further stated that his resignation was not admittance to the disciplinary allegations held against him.
Head Librarian Anna Gold said the alleged incident had no observable effect on the atmosphere of the library, nor are there any concerns regarding the safety of the library. The use continues to climb and since it is busy, it is very safe, Gold said.

LONG BEACH, Calif. --  A college professor suspended for dating students and offering course credit for homosexual and extramarital sex abruptly resigned his teaching post, university officials said Thursday.
Professor Barry Singer, 39, sent a postcard informing Cal State Long Beach officials of his resignation last Friday, two days after he was suspended for 30 days without pay.

University spokesman Dr. Robert Breunig said officials received the written notice Wednesday, followed by a letter of confirmation, and immediately accepted the resignation.
'He did not indicate at all why he resigned,' Breunig said.
Singer, a tenured psychology professor, came under fire from Christian groups and university officials last month after it was reported that he offered credit in his 'Psychology of Sex' course for homosexual, group and extramarital sex.
Chancellor Glenn Dumke, head of the 19-campus Cal State system, recommended last Wednesday that Singer be suspended for his 'reprehensible' behavior after the professor disclosed he had dated several students.
Singer, who could not be reached for comment, said last week he was surprised by the public outcry over his teaching methods and said he had received several death threats.
'I've pretty much sunk to the basement level,' he said. 'I've got 40 million people out there who are ready to kill me. Some of my colleagues are put out with me, and campus administrators are upset too.'

After his course came under scrutiny by a faculty review committee, Singer agreed to drop credit for the sexual activities, but still gave credit for field trips to gay bars, dressing in drag and visiting nudist colonies.
'It can be a very powerful growth and learning experience,' Singer said of the homework assignments. 'The idea is not to go out and do some kinky things just to see what they're like, but to see change in your behavior and your feelings.'
In a series of subsequent interviews, Singer revealed that he attended risque student parties where nudity and sex occurred and had been 'romantically involved' with several students.
He also released a letter he wrote two years ago outlining the benefits of intimate relations with students, noting it gave the professor experience that could improve his teaching.
Breunig said Singer made an appointment to meet this week with the vice president for academic affairs, but failed to show for the meeting.
He said the university had received about 60 letters and telephone calls from people describing themselves as taxpayers and citizens who were outraged by Singer's teaching methods.
The 'Psychology of Sex' class, which Singer taught for 8 years, will be offered next year under stricter guidelines, Breunig said.

'Dr. Glendon Drake, vice president for academic affairs, has directed the Department of Psychology to establish guidelines for this course, consistent with those established by the American Psychological Association's ethical principals for psychologists,' Breunig said.
Singer, who earned between $30,276 and $36,540 as a tenured professor, will be eligible for retirement benefits.

							     [Civ. No. 23481. Court of Appeals of California, Third Appellate District.  April 16, 1985.]  ORIE ALFRED BROWN, Plaintiff and Appellant, v. STATE PERSONNEL BOARD, Defendant and Respondent; TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGES, Real Party in Interest and Respondent.  (Opinion by Blease, J., with Puglia, P. J., and Carr, J., concurring.) [166 Cal. App. 3d 1152]  COUNSEL  Colley, Lindsey & Colley and Nathaniel S. Colley, Sr., for Plaintiff and Appellant.  No appearance for Defendant and Respondent.  John K. Van de Kamp, Attorney General, N. Eugene Hill, Assistant Attorney General, Charles C. Kobayashi, and Susan P. Underwood, Deputy Attorneys General, for Real Party in Interest and Respondent.  OPINION  BLEASE, J.  Four years after discovery of allegations that associate professor Orie Brown made amorous overtures to two adult female students, [166 Cal. App. 3d 1155] officials of California State University at Sacramento (CSUS) filed charges of misconduct. They charged these acts (and three others), as ""a series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students,"" were cause for dismissal and Brown was fired. The two remote acts and one other occurring in 1979 were upheld as justifying dismissal by the State Personnel Board (board). Brown appeals from a judgment denying him relief by way of a writ of mandate (Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5). We conclude that the extreme delay in filing these charges precludes their use as grounds of discipline and that the remaining ground of discipline is insufficient to sustain the charge made. We will reverse the judgment and direct Brown's reinstatement.  Facts  The basis for the dismissal is unprofessional conduct and failure to perform the duties of his office, charged as ""a series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students."" The events sustaining the cause were alleged to be five in number, three of which it was alleged were accompanied by threats of retaliation or retaliation. CSUS admits that it ""does not now, and never has had any rule, regulation, law or policy against faculty and students dating each other, or even living together or marrying one another."" Thus, the claim of misconduct is not premised on the fact of the sexual overtures alone. Rather, it is the extensiveness of the conduct which impairs the teacher student relationship by threats of retaliation which is viewed by CSUS as rendering the matter actionable.  Brown was charged in 1981 with five instances of sexual harassment of his female students, in violation of Education Code section 89535, subdivisions (a), (b) and (f). The board found that allegations of two of the instances were baseless. Allegations that Brown had linked his conduct with retaliation or threats of retaliation were found not to be true. Of the remaining charges two of the instances were in 1975 and the remaining instance in 1979. The board did find that these three charges had merit, albeit in two cases only partial merit. This was found to be cause for dismissal as both unprofessional conduct and a failure to carry out the duties of his position. (Respectively subds. (b) and (f) of Ed. Code, § 89535.)  fn. 1  At the outset of the board hearing Brown argued that two of the three incidents which form the basis of his dismissal should not be considered because the events in 1975 are too remote to serve as grounds of discipline. The board hearing officer rejected the contention that delay in prosecution of the charges could bar their use as a basis of dismissal. He said that if the [166 Cal. App. 3d 1156] evidence showed inability to defend as a result of the delay he would consider the claim. In his proposed decision the hearing officer reiterated the conclusion that no statute of limitation was applicable to failure to prosecute a misconduct claim against a CSUS employee. The hearing officer found the passage of time had prejudiced Brown with respect to defense of the two charges found not sustained but that there was no such prejudice regarding the 1975 incidents. A general description of the charges found substantiated by the board will suffice to set the analytical stage.  Brown taught courses in criminal law at CSUS in the spring of 1975. One of Brown's female students, Ms. H., accompanied him to his office after they had been drinking beer in the school cafeteria. Brown made a pass at her, embracing her and attempting to kiss her. She rejected his advances. Another female student, Ms. N., was discussing an extra credit paper with Brown in his office when he made comments on her attractive physical appearance. He made a pass at her, embracing her and attempting to kiss her. She pushed him away and left his office.  Neither student complained to school authorities concerning these incidents until a year later, in the spring of 1976, when Brown was being considered for promotion and tenure. Then the complaints came to the attention of Professor Melnicoe, the chairman of Brown's department. Melnicoe testified that, although he believed the complaints were relevant to Brown's fitness to teach, they were not mentioned in the promotion and tenure proceedings. He said that the charges were not pursued as disciplinary matters because of the reluctance of the complainants. Melnicoe did bring them to the attention of his administrative superiors but was instructed ""not to go forward [with] anything because the complainants were unwilling to take any action at that time.""  Brown testified that Melnicoe brought up the accusations prior to the award of promotion and tenure. He also testified that the school's rules provided that charges of misconduct were germane to the decision to grant or deny tenure and promotion. He testified that he was summoned before the faculty committee considering his application for tenure and promotion and questioned concerning the charges of Ms. N. and Ms. H. Thereafter, the committee recommended that he receive tenure and be promoted. The CSUS president accepted the recommendation. The board found that the Ms. H. and Ms. N. incidents had been ""discussed by the faculty of the department at a meeting where [Brown's] promotion was being considered.""  The final alleged incident of sexual harassment sustained by the board hearing officer occurred four years later. It concerned Ms. B. She was a [166 Cal. App. 3d 1157] student in two of Brown's courses in the fall of 1979. She had sought Brown out on two occasions to discuss with him personal problems unrelated to her coursework. Later, on October 15, 1979, she went to his office to discuss her difficulties in studying for midterm examinations. While she was there Brown asked when his ""date"" was. Ms. B. said there was no date and noted Brown was a married man and a parent. As she was leaving Brown stated he would ""sure like to make love to [her]."" Ms. B. took this to be a proposition and was offended. She complained to another university professor who took her to Melnicoe.  Melnicoe took no immediate action. In January 1980 Ms. B. filed a title 9 complaint with CSUS. An investigation was commenced by university authorities in March 1980. A protracted review procedure culminated in the issuance of the notice of dismissal in June of 1981. The notice included Ms. B's charges as one of the alleged ""series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students."" The notice is the administrative pleading upon which the dismissal action which we review was predicated.  Discussion  I  Brown challenges the five-year delay in the bringing of charges based upon the 1975 events on grounds it violates the statute of limitations in Government Code section 19635 and, failing that, constitutes laches. Only the latter claim has merit.  Brown implicitly relies upon the statute of limitations applicable to state civil service employees, Government Code section 19635. It provides: ""No punitive action shall be valid against any state employee for any cause for discipline based on any civil service law of this State, unless notice of such punitive action is served within three years after the cause for discipline, upon which such notice is based, first arose. Punitive action based on fraud, embezzlement, or the falsification of records shall be valid, if notice of such action is served within three years after the discovery of such fraud, embezzlement, or falsification."" [1] This section would be dispositive of the 1975 charges if it governed state university disciplinary proceedings. It does not. Although Brown is a state employee, the cause of discipline (Ed. Code, § 89535) is not ""based on any civil service law ...."" fn. 2 [166 Cal. App. 3d 1158]  Brown then suggests that the provisions of Government Code section 19635 have been incorporated into the board's hearing procedures which are made applicable to him by Education Code section 89539. That is not the case. Section 89539 provides that when, as here, a university employee elects to have his case heard before the board, the board ""shall hold a hearing, following the same procedure as in state civil service proceedings ...."" That direction addresses only the civil service hearing procedures before the board. It refers to Government Code section 19578 which requires that the ""hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 11513 of the Government Code ...."" The latter section specifies the evidentiary and other rules for the conduct of the hearing. It does not encompass pleadings, notices and other matters ancillary to the hearing such as matters pertaining to the limitation of actions (Gov. Code, § 19630 et seq.) of which Government Code section 19635 is a part.  Thus, Government Code section 19635 does not directly govern the period within which CSUS must file charges, nor does it do so via Education Code section 89539. These conclusions, however, do not mean that section 19635 has no application to Brown's case.  II  [2] In civil actions laches is a bar to equitable relief. (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law (8th ed. 1974) Equity § 14, pp. 5239-5240; Stevenson v. Boyd (1908) 153 Cal. 630, 636 [96 P. 284].) It has been made applicable to quasi adjudicative proceedings as a common law policy pursuant to the ""inherent power [of courts] independent of statutory provisions to dismiss an action on motion of the defendant where it is not diligently prosecuted."" (Steen v. City of Los Angeles (1948) 31 Cal. 2d 542, 546 [190 P.2d 937]; cf. Gates v. Department of Motor Vehicles (1979) 94 Cal. App. 3d 921, 924-925 [156 Cal. Rptr. 791]; see generally Cal. Administrative Hearing Practice (Cont.Ed.Bar 1984) Proceedings Before Hearing, § 2.21.) ""The policy to expedite justice underlying the rule, exists where the proceeding is before a local administrative agency exercising quasi judicial functions such as the board in the instant case. By analogy a proceeding before such a board should be dismissed where an unreasonable time has elapsed--where the proceeding is not diligently prosecuted."" (Steen, supra, at pp. 546-547.) In such cases"" the appointing power is analogous to what in a civil action would be the plaintiff, and the employee the defendant."" (Id, at p. 547.) [166 Cal. App. 3d 1159] Thus the administrative agency must diligently pursue the disciplinary action as if it were seeking equitable relief. In measuring diligence the courts will apply notions of laches borrowed from the civil law.  [3] In civil actions the ""defense of laches requires unreasonable delay plus either acquiescence in the act about which plaintiff complains or prejudice to the defendant resulting from the delay."" (Conti v. Board of Civil Service Commissioners (1969) 1 Cal. 3d 351, 359 [82 Cal. Rptr. 337, 461 P.2d 617], fns. omitted.) Ordinarily delay alone does not constitute laches because ""[t]he policy of this state with respect to lapse of time is [separately] embodied in statutes [of limitation] ...."" (McGuire v. Hibernia S. & L. Soc. (1944) 23 Cal. 2d 719, 736 [146 Cal. Rptr. 673, 151 A.L.R. 1062].) For this reason the courts ""have consistently rejected the concept that lapse of time less than the period of limitations in itself constitutes a defense."" (Conti, supra, at p. 359, fn. omitted.) Thus ""[d]elay is not a bar unless it works to the disadvantage or prejudice of other parties."" (7 Witkin, Summary of Cal. Law, supra, Equity, § 15, p. 5240; see also 2 Pomeroy's Equity Jurisprudence (5th ed. 1941) pp. 177-179.)  It is said that ""[t]here is no fixed rule as to the circumstances that must exist or as to the period of time which must elapse before the doctrine of laches can be appropriately applied."" (Brown v. State Personnel Board (1941) 43 Cal. App. 2d 70, 78 [110 P.2d 497].) That is so because what generally makes delay unreasonable is that it results in prejudice. ""These two factors are interrelated ...."" (In re Marriage of Modnick (1983) 33 Cal. 3d 897, 908 [191 Cal. Rptr. 629, 663 P.2d 187].) ""'It is not so much a question of the lapse of time as it is to determine whether prejudice has resulted. If the delay has caused no material change in statu quo, ante, i.e., no detriment suffered by the party pleading the laches, his plea is in vain.'"" (Conti, supra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 360, quoting from Brown, supra, at p. 79.) Because of the relationship between prejudice and delay the circumstances which give rise to laches vary widely depending upon their interplay in the specific case.  [4] However, there is one circumstance in which unreasonable delay could be found as a matter of law. At the common law, in cases in which equity was not strictly bound by the statute of limitations applicable to actions at law, the courts sometimes adopted for purposes of laches ""a period within which its aid must be sought, similar to that prescribed in analogous cases at law."" (1 Wood on Limitations (4th ed. 1916) p. 276; cf. Holmberg v. Armbrecht (1945) 327 U.S. 392, 396 [90 L. Ed. 743, 747 [66 S. Ct. 582, 162 A.L.R. 719].) In such cases the burden was placed on the plaintiff to show a reasonable excuse for the delay. (Wood, supra, at p. 277, fn. 64.) A similar rule has been adopted in California. In cases in which no statute [166 Cal. App. 3d 1160] of limitations directly applies but there is a statute of limitations governing an analogous action at law, the period may be borrowed as a measure of the outer limit of reasonable delay in determining laches. (SeeIn re Marriage of Modnick, supra, 33 Cal.3d at p. 909;Vai v. Bank of America (1961) 56 Cal. 2d 329, 343 [15 Cal. Rptr. 71, 364 P.2d 247]; Keys v. Marin County (1871) 42 Cal. 252, 256; Ponce v. Graceous Navigation, Inc. (1981) 126 Cal. App. 3d 823, 829 [179 Cal. Rptr. 164]; Scott v. Municipal Court (1974) 40 Cal. App. 3d 995 [115 Cal. Rptr. 620]; Longfellow v. Presidente Miguel Aleman (1974) 36 Cal. App. 3d 508, 514 [111 Cal. Rptr. 643]; Protopappas v. Protopappas (1963) 213 Cal. App. 2d 659, 665 [28 Cal. Rptr. 884]; Curbelo v. Matson Navigation Co. (1961) 194 Cal. App. 2d 305, 308 [14 Cal. Rptr. 913]; compare Zastrow v. Zastrow (1976) 61 Cal. App. 3d 710, 714-715 [132 Cal. Rptr. 536]; see also Ulakovic v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. (1940) 339 Pa. 371 [16 A.2d 41]; 3 Sutherland, Statutory Construction (4th ed. 1974) § 70.03; cf. Lux v. Haggin (1886) 69 Cal. 255, 269 [10 P. 674]; Civ. Code, § 3511.) Whether or not such a borrowing should occur depends upon the strength of the analogy.  [5] We find a strong analogy in Government Code section 19635. As related, it does not govern this case as a statute of limitations. However the section does reflect a legislative policy judgment that a delay of three years is inherently unreasonable in the prosecution of a disciplinary action against a broad range of public employees. The vast and undifferentiated gamut of state employees which are covered by this provision includes employees whose positions mirror those of CSUS employees. (See, e.g., Gov. Code, § 18597.) Thus, section 19635 provides a compelling indication of the outer limit of delay which is reasonable in the prosecution of a disciplinary action against an employee of the state university system. We borrow this period and hold that unless excused, a delay in the initiation of disciplinary proceedings for more than three years is unreasonable as a matter of law.  The board offers as contrary a line of case law of which Bold v. Board of Medical Examiners (1933) 133 Cal. App. 23 [23 P.2d 826] is the leading case. It asserts that statutes of limitation in the Code of Civil Procedure should not be borrowed and applied to administrative disciplinary proceedings. (Also see, e.g., Bernd v. Eu (1979) 100 Cal. App. 3d 511 [161 Cal. Rptr. 58]; Rudolph v. Athletic Commission (1960) 177 Cal. App. 2d 1, 22 [1 Cal. Rptr. 898]; cf., e.g., In re Lowenthal (1889) 78 Cal. 428 [21 P. 7].) However, this case law is distinguished by two critical considerations. First, the analogies between the claims covered by the civil statutes of limitations and those at issue in the administrative actions were weak. Second, in none of these cases was there a delay by the public agency against whom laches was asserted. By contrast, the analogy between the kind of cases [166 Cal. App. 3d 1161] covered by Government Code section 19635 and Brown's case provides a precise parallel and it is the agency which has delayed.  That leads us to consider the effect of the unreasonable delay. [6] Statutes of limitation and the doctrine of laches share a common policy. ""'Statutes of limitation, like the equitable doctrine of laches, in their conclusive effects are designed to promote justice by preventing surprises through the revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.'"" (Wood v. Elling Corp. (1977) 20 Cal. 3d 353, 362 [142 Cal. Rptr. 696, 572 P.2d 755], quoting from Telegraphers v. Ry. Express Agency 1944)321 U.S. 342, 348 [88 L. Ed. 788, 792, 64 S. Ct. 582].) The policies also encompass other forms of injury such as those resulting from a change of position during a delay. A statute of limitations effectuates these policies by a fixed rule which, absent tolling, bars the proceeding without proof of prejudice. Laches, on the other hand, requires proof of a delay which results in prejudice or change of position.  However, as applied to laches the ""effect of the violation of [the analogous] statute is to shift the burden to the plaintiff to prove that his delay was excusable and that the defendant was not prejudiced thereby."" (Curbelo, supra, 194 Cal.App.2d at p. 310; see also Ponce, supra, 126 Cal.App.3d at p. 830.) That gives effect to the policies of the statute in the context of laches while removing the rigidity of the statutes of limitation. Conti says that the burden of proof of prejudice ought not to be shifted, at least where the party asserting the defense of laches enjoys better access to the date respecting prejudice. (Conti, supra, 1 Cal.3d at p. 361.) But Conti did not concern the borrowing of an analogous statute of limitations. Rather it operated within a context of a directly governing statute of limitation. In that context, the policy of the statute was effected solely as a statute of limitations. Here, no effect can be given to the policy of the borrowed statute unless it establishes a presumption which shifts the burden of proof. We turn to the issues of excuse and prejudice.  ""In order to excuse delay, [the responsible party] must show exceptional circumstances prevented earlier action."" (Ponce, supra, 126 Cal.App.3d at p. 829, citation omitted.) That might be shown, for example, where the public agency lacks knowledge of the grounds of action. That is not the case here. [7] The only excuse advanced by CSUS is the reluctance of the witnesses to the 1975 events to lodge a formal complaint. This is unpersuasive. If an overt sexual advance to a student while acting as a professor is unprofessional conduct that is so regardless of the subjective response of the student. Whether the student welcomes the advance, declines the [166 Cal. App. 3d 1162] offer, or is deeply affronted, is extraneous. Unprofessional conduct may be a breach of the rights of the particular student or students affected. However, with respect to the dismissal of a professor for cause, the administrative cause of action is not founded upon a private right of a particular student. It is founded on the right and duty of CSUS to deter misconduct with punishment, just as a criminal offense is a matter between the state and the offender, independent of the wishes of the victim of the offense. The disposition of the victim may be of interest in the exercise of discretion to prosecute or not to prosecute. However, when the election is made to forego prosecution the unreasonable delay that attends that election is not excused merely because the authorities have deferred to the wishes of the victim. It is just as unfair to let an employee ""twist slowly in the wind"" regardless of who the employer permits to hold the rope. CSUS attempts to bolster its argument by noting it has a ""practice"" to act only upon written complaint. That is not an excuse. A self-imposed constraint is no more a justification because it is delineated a practice than if it is discretionary. We note that when CSUS made up its mind to act it was able to persuade the formerly reluctant victims to participate.  In sum, we find no cognizable excuse for the delay of four years in initiating the disciplinary action concerning the 1975 events.  [8] That leaves the issue of prejudice. CSUS did attempt to meet this burden. The board said: ""[Brown] made no showing of injury as a result of the delay in the charges, nor could he do so. The only witnesses who testified about each of these incidents were the women involved and appellant. No one else could have testified, since appellant was alone with each woman at the time of the alleged harassment. None of their memories seemed to be dimmed by the passage of time. Thus, there was no injury, and the doctrine of laches does not apply."" The board however did not go far enough. Assuming that we credit its determination of credibility, prejudice may also be established by detrimental reliance by the affected party upon the status quo. (See Vesper v. Forest Lawn Cem. Assn. (1937) 20 Cal. App. 2d 157, 165-166 [67 P.2d 368]; see also e.g., Lux v. Haggin, supra, 69 Cal. at pp. 269-270;Conti v. Board of Civil Service Commissioners, supra, at p. 360 relying upon Brown v. State Personnel Board (1941) 43 Cal. App. 2d 70, 79 [110 P.2d 497]; see also Zakaessian v. Zakaessian (1945) 70 Cal. App. 2d 721, 726-727 [161 P.2d 677].) The record shows such reliance. The tenure committees in 1976 advanced Brown to tenure in the face of the 1975 charges. The board found that the Ms. H. and Ms. N. incidents had been ""discussed by the faculty of the department at a meeting where [Brown's] promotion was being considered."" That is a [166 Cal. App. 3d 1163] circumstance which we must assume, in the absence of contrary proof by CSUS, led Brown to devote his energies to his employment with CSUS and perforce to forgo other employment opportunities. Nothing in the record supports an inference that Brown was without alternative prospects. Professor Melnicoe testified that Brown was a good teacher whose evaluations compared favorably with other faculty members. The loss of four years at the outset of an academic career is a considerable change of position in reliance upon the status quo. That works a sufficient prejudice to transform the unreasonable delay in this case into the bar of laches. Accordingly, the disciplinary action may not be founded upon the 1975 events.  III  [9] That leaves intact the finding of a single sexual advance made in 1979 without threats of academic retaliation and tenders the question whether it alone supports the disciplinary action. We will answer in the negative because it does not support the charges upon which the disciplinary action was taken and they cannot be amended at this late date.  The notice of dismissal, the charging document filed by CSUS, alleged a linked set of events as the singular ground constituting the cause for discipline. It charged that ""[t]he events upon which the ... causes [e.g. unprofessional conduct] are based are a series and pattern of sexual harassment of female students by you, including harassment of: [Ms. N., H. and B. accompanied by threats or retaliation]."" The finding of a single sexual advance to Ms. B., made without threat or retaliation, remaining after elimination of the 1975 charges from consideration, does not support that charge. Manifestly a single instance does not constitute a series or a pattern. Nor was the act accompanied by retaliation as charged. That bears upon the question whether the advance impinged upon Brown's professional duties. We again note that CSUS admits that it ""does not now, and never has had any rule, regulation, law or policy against faculty and students dating each other, or even living together or marrying one another."" Accordingly, there is not substantial evidence to support the charge made. (See Code Civ. Proc., § 1094.5; cf. Wheeler v. State Bd. of Forestry (1983) 144 Cal. App. 3d 522, 528 [192 Cal. Rptr. 693].) That conclusion compels Brown's reinstatement. fn. 3 [166 Cal. App. 3d 1164]  [10] The discipline of an employee of the California State University and Colleges must be predicated upon a ""statement of causes [and] the events or transactions upon which the causes are based ...."" (Ed. Code, § 89538.) The causes for discipline are set forth in Education Code section 89535 and include unprofessional conduct. The university initiates the disciplinary proceedings by giving a notice (the charging document) to the employee alleging the causes and events upon which discipline is based and takes the disciplinary ""action"" (Ed. Code, §§ 89538, 89539). The action constitutes the university's judgment that the conduct, i.e., the alleged ""events or transactions,"" meets CSUS's criteria of the alleged cause of discipline, e.g., unprofessional conduct, and that the respondent has engaged in it. Neither section 89539 nor any other provision of law fn. 4 permits the amendment of the charging document after CSUS has taken its disciplinary action. fn. 5  Where, as here, the employee elects an appeal to the State Personnel Board, Education Code section 89539 governs both the grounds of appeal and (necessarily) the grounds upon which the board may act, here ""that the employee did not do the acts or omissions alleged as the events or transactions upon which the causes are based ...."" (Italics added.) This provision limits the board's authority to act (Ed. Code, § 89539) to the allegations [166 Cal. App. 3d 1165] of the charging document. Consequently, the board may not alter the charging document or take action upon a charge not made.  The judgment is reversed. The trial court shall issue a peremptory writ of mandamus directing the reinstatement of Brown and according him any other relief to which he may be entitled as a result of said reinstatement.  Puglia, P. J., and Carr, J., concurred.  FN 1. The board impliedly rejected the charge that the conduct was also immoral conduct. (Ed. Code, § 89535, subd. (a).)  FN 2. Employees of the California State University and Colleges are exempt from the constitutionally mandated civil service system. (Cal. Const., art. VII, § 4, subd. (h).) They are state employees. (Slivkoff v. Board of Trustees (1977) 69 Cal. App. 3d 394, 401 [137 Cal. Rptr. 920].) However, they do not come within Government Code section 19635 because it applies only to a ""cause for discipline based on any civil service law of this State ...."" The cause of discipline in this case stems from Education Code section 89535 which is not a civil service law. (See Gov. Code, § 18526.) That the Legislature has accorded the state universities some attributes of civil service protection, e.g., tenure and the right to a State Personnel Board hearing concerning disciplinary action, does not have the effect of conversion of their status to that of civil service employees. (Cal. State Employees Assn. v. Trustees of Cal. State Colleges (1965) 237 Cal. App. 2d 530, 538-539 [47 Cal. Rptr. 73].) Thus Government Code section 19635 cannot be applied directly as a limitation applicable to Brown's dismissal.  FN 3. It might be argued that the appropriate disposition is to remand the case to the board for a reconsideration of the penalty in the light of the remaining finding. That is sometimes appropriate in cases in which there has been a failure to make a finding necessary to support the charge made. (See American Funeral Concepts v. Board of Funeral Directors & Embalmers (1982) 136 Cal. App. 3d 303, 314 [186 Cal. Rptr. 196]; Robinson v. State Personnel Bd. (1979) 97 Cal. App. 3d 994, 1003-1004 [159 Cal. Rptr. 222].) However, nothing in these cases authorizes an amendment of the charging document or requires a respondent to defend against a charge not made.  FN 4. It is noteworthy that the provisions which govern state civil service proceedings, although not applicable here, provide for amendment of the charging document only prior to the submission of the appeal for decision by the board. In such case, ""[i]f the amended ... notice presents new causes or allegations the employee shall be afforded a reasonable opportunity to prepare his defense thereto ...."" (See Gov. Code, § 19575.5, italics added.)  FN 5. In the absence of a procedure which permits a respondent to prepare for and contest an amended charge a serious constitutional problem arises. Due process requires that the respondent be given ""notice ... of the standards by which his conduct is to be measured"" (Wheeler v. Board of Forestry, supra, 144 Cal.App.3d at p. 527) and ""fair notice as to the reach of the [disciplinary] procedure."" (In re Ruffalo (1968) 390 U.S. 544, 552 [20 L. Ed. 2d 117, 123, 88 S. Ct. 1222].) That requires that the respondent be given adequate notice both of the claimed legal standard and the events which are alleged to contravene it and an opportunity to challenge them. Where the cause alleged has potential application to a broad range of conduct, such as unprofessional conduct, the events alleged to contravene the charge do more than allege what must be proved. They also provide criteria by which the charge is narrowed. (Cf. Wheeler, supra, 144 Cal.App.3d at pp. 527-528.) Any significant amendment of the events alleged to constitute the cause alters not only what must be proved but may alter the criteria by which the cause is to be measured. Although Brown was put on notice that the events which constitute the remaining finding were in issue their significance as a singular ground of discipline was not charged or communicated to him. That might have entirely altered the cast of Brown's case. We note that the board expressed equivocation about the viability of the 1979 events as a sole ground of discipline. We imply no opinion on that subject.

On her Skepchick blog, Watson slammed Krauss for not acknowledging his obvious bias — and thus violating a core value of skepticism. “Krauss’ statement is extremely disturbing and makes scientists look like ignorant, biased fools who will twist data to suit their own needs,” she wrote.“I remain skeptical, and I support a man whose character I believe I know,” Krauss responded in the post’s comments. “If you want to condemn me for that, so be it.”The dust-up was part of a broader discussion among feminist skeptics about what they saw as the misogyny of some of the old guard. In June 2011, Watson posted a YouTube video mentioning her experiences with men in the movement.In the resulting furor, Watson was publicly mocked by Dawkins and received a torrent of online abuse. Over the next couple of years, she posted a sample of the abusive comments she received on her blog.With these issues dividing skeptics, Hensley, by then executive director of CFI’s Washington DC branch, organized a new conference called “Women in Secularism,” which debuted in May of 2012. It was a space to celebrate the history and accomplishments of secular women, Hensley said, “but also to give a platform so that we could talk about the issues and problems we were facing.” In now-deleted comments on CFI’s blog post announcing the event, some skeptics argued that the movement didn’t have a problem with women, and that the event would amount to “man bashing.”On one panel, Jen McCreight, then a biology PhD student, spoke out about the whisper network. Before going to her first big atheist meeting, she said, “unsolicited I got many emails from different individuals basically warning me which male speakers not to interact with as a young woman.”She didn’t name names. But in August of 2013, with accusations swirling about sexual harassment by several other prominent atheists, McCreight pointed the finger at Krauss. On her Blag Hag blog, she described the experiences of two unnamed women. One was Hensley. The other asked BuzzFeed News to refer to her by her first initial, A.A. was an undergraduate who had first met Krauss in 2008 at the annual American Atheists Convention through her work as a student atheist activist. Three years later, when she and other students walked into the bar at the same meeting in Des Moines, Iowa, A. recalled, Krauss pulled over a chair for her and started running his hand up her leg under the table.“I kind of shifted away,” A. said. “He put his hand on again. I crossed my legs. He put his hand on again. And eventually I had to like physically turn my entire body.”A. was shocked, but didn’t want to make a scene, she said. “The last thing I need to do is, you know, yell at Lawrence and then have to deal with any potential fallout.”Krauss denied A.’s account, and said that it was A. who had come on to him, inviting him to join her in the hotel’s hot tub. Robin Elisabeth Cornwell, a friend of Krauss’s and then executive director of the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science, was also there, and backed his account. A. denied mentioning the hot tub or flirting with Krauss. Benjamin Wurst, one of her student companions, told BuzzFeed News that, as they left the bar, A. told him Krauss had put his hand on her.Some CFI staff, too, were concerned about Krauss’s behavior, and it was a point of contention when the organization’s leaders were considering whether to invite him as a featured speaker on a cruise to the Galápagos Islands. He was by then an honorary member of the organization’s board of directors.“I really don’t want Krauss on this trip,” Patricia Beauchamp, CFI’s business and finance manager, emailed CFI’s then-president, Ronald Lindsay, on March 11, 2013. “His behavior on past trips has been offensive to many and this is a very expensive and small vessel.”She was referring to a 2011 CFI cruise of the Greek Islands. Krauss had reportedly propositioned a woman to join him and a female companion for sex in their cabin. (Both Krauss and his companion on the cruise, now his wife, told BuzzFeed News that the incident did not happen.)Lindsay’s response to Beauchamp’s email focused on the bottom line: “Is it your position that Krauss will keep us from selling cabins? If so, you need to say so expressly, and you also need to give me some evidence. If Krauss is not invited, this will be a major issue, so i need facts, not speculation.”Beauchamp noted the “report of unwanted sexual attention given to one guest.” She concluded, “This is not the kind of person I think should represent us on a cruise.”Beauchamp declined to comment for this story. Lindsay told BuzzFeed News that, after Beauchamp’s email, he discussed the incident with the passenger in question. “I did call the guest and she substantially confirmed what Ms. Beauchamp had said. I apologized on behalf of the organization,” Lindsay said by email. He also said he discussed the incident with Krauss, who denied it. Krauss was invited on the cruise.Hensley had by then started talking about the incident in the Washington, DC, hotel room, telling several CFI colleagues, including Lindsay. He said he told her she “probably” could file a complaint.Lindsay no longer leads CFI, which has since merged with the Richard Dawkins Foundation for Reason and Science. Dawkins did not respond to requests for comment, and the organization’s current leadership stated that it “follows its policies and procedures regarding complaints of improper behavior, and will continue to do so, to further its goal of ensuring the safety and well-being of attendees, guests, volunteers, and employees at its events.”After Krauss left a comment on McCreight’s blog denying her allegations, she took the post down. “Well, Famous Skeptic is vaguely threatening to sue me,” McCreight wrote the day after her initial post was published. “Since Famous Skeptic is rich and I am poor, and since my two sources are too terrified to openly speak out,” she said, “I have removed the part of my previous post that refers to him so I don’t go bankrupt with legal fees.”McCreight declined to be interviewed for this article. A second blog post published at about the same time by another young skeptic, Ed Cara, which described the allegation about the 2011 cruise, was also quickly taken offline.

NEW BRITAIN–A former professor has been arrested after allegations that he sexually assaulted a student. 

Daniel Gula, 52, a former CCSU professor, was accused of assaulting a student of in the fall of 2014. He was arrested on Wednesday, September 2, and charged with sexual assault in the third degree, unlawful restraint in the first degree and disorderly conduct. 

The student made the allegations to the school’s Women Center on September 23, 2014, who then reported it to the chief diversity officer and Title IX officer. 

The school then interviewed the student, who started CCSU in the fall of 2014. 

In the interview, the student said she met Daniel Gula, an adjunct professor in the English department, early in the semester. She soon chose him as a mentor, and the two exchanged emails. 

The interview was outlined in an investigatory report from the school, which Fox CT obtained. In it, the student said that until September 15, the relationship was professional. However, on that day, she stopped by his office to talk, and things changed. She said that as she went to leave, Gula inappropriately touched her and exposed his genitals. 

The suspect said she believed he was like that with other students, and it seemed like he had planned the interaction. 

The school began an investigation, which was completed on October 22. In the instigation, it says the student initially did not want to name the professor or pursue charges, but she did want to have a class of hers moved to a different building because it was at the same time the professor was in that building. She also wanted to drop Gula’s English class. 

Eventually, she dropped both of those classes and was issued a full refund. 

Six days after her initial report of the incident, on September 29, the student named Gula as the perpetrator in a report to CCSU police. She still didn’t want to pursue charges, or participate in the investigation. 

When the school investigator tried to interview Gula, he wouldn’t respond. Eventually, he provided a handwritten statement to police admitting to the allegations. 

The investigation concluded Gula had violated the college’s sexual misconduct, sexual assault and intimate partner violence policy. He was asked to resign, and he did. 

Gula was only arrested this week because the victim decided to pursue charges after learning he had resigned from the school instead of being fired, meaning he could potentially get another job with another university. 

Gula’s lawyer released the following statement to Fox CT: “At this point, we are gathering information in terms of what specifically is being alleged to have occurred in order to resolve this matter.”

https://www.wtnh.com/news/former-professor-who-was-sentenced-for-inappropriate-behavior-now-facing-lawsuit/1068779029,"
NEW BRITAIN, Conn. (WTNH) — A former Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) student has filed a lawsuit against the professor she has alleged sexually assaulted her while attending the college.
In a release sent to News 8, Nina Pirrotti of Garrison Levin‐Epstein Fitzgerald & Pirrotti announced that she has filed a lawsuit on Jan. 31, 2017 on behalf of her client, Shannon Cunningham, against Daniel Gula, formerly a professor at CCSU. The complaint alleges that while Cunningham was a student at CCSU and Daniel Gula was a professor there, he sexually assaulted her in his office. The release states that Cunningham reported his conduct against her to the Woman’s Center at CCSU, the university’s Title IX Officer and the CCSU Police Department. The firm announced that according to CCSU police reports, Gula confessed to the conduct.
Cunningham’s attorneys say that she initially did not wish to pursue a criminal case against Gula but, when she found out that CCSU had permitted him to resign and that he subsequently was able to secure employment as a professor in an all‐women’s college, she sought his arrest and prosecution. On Jan. 31, 2017, Gula entered a plea of nolo contendere after which the court entered a verdict of guilty of the crimes of unlawful restraint in the second-degree, reckless endangerment in the first-degree and Coercion and sentenced Gula to a one‐year suspended jail sentence and two years’ probation.
According to Cunningham’s attorney’s, she has filed this lawsuit because “she is determined to do what she can to hold Daniel Gula fully accountable for his actions, not only for her sake but for the sake of all female students with whom he may interact now or in the future”.

Joshua Perlstein
Two Central Connecticut State University theater professors investigated on suspicions of engaging in sexual misconduct with their students have left the university.
Joshua Perlstein, who was hired in 1992 and placed on paid administrative leave in April 2018, abruptly resigned on May 16, shortly before a scheduled termination hearing, a spokeswoman for the college said Wednesday.
Thomas Delventhal, who was hired in 1998 and placed on paid leave in January, was terminated by the university on May 24, but is exercising his right to appeal the action, the spokeswoman said.
Thomas Delventhal
Both professors were the subject of an investigation that concluded in January that each had likely engaged in sexual misconduct with one or more students.
Perlstein, whose annual salary was $97,847, had been on paid administrative leave for about 13 months, a spokeswoman said, while Delventhal, who was earning $97,652 annually, was on paid leave for about four months. The spokeswoman said Perlstein has applied for retirement benefits, a process which she said is handled by the state comptroller.
CCSU President Zulma R. Toro, who announced plans to fire both professors in January, expressed frustration at the length of termination proceedings under the collective bargaining agreement.
“It has been a long process, especially for the sexual assault survivors and the Theatre Department students and faculty. The investigation and termination proceedings have been frustrating and challenging, but we are moving forward,” Toro said Wednesday. “We have learned a great deal and made significant changes in personnel, policies, and procedures – with much more to come.”
Toro hired the Hartford law firm, Shipman & Goodwin LLP to investigate last spring after an April 2018 article in CCSU’s student newspaper, The Recorder, revealed allegations of sexual misconduct against Perlstein. The same article also detailed a lack of administrative action when complaints were made.
The investigation, which was completed Jan. 10 and entailed reviewing thousands of documents and emails, and conducting interviews with dozens of faculty, staff and current and former students, found significant evidence that Perlstein was involved in sexual misconduct with several students, including a lengthy, manipulative relationship with one student that continued after her graduation. The investigation did not provide the names of the students.
It also found that the professor had a “history of questionable interactions” with female students, was untruthful to investigators and attempted to conceal his problematic conduct because he believed it would put his job in jeopardy.
Following up on students’ complaints about Delventhal, the investigators said that he admitted to over the years kissing five students on the neck and/or forehead, was untruthful during his investigatory interview, and denied attempting to engage in any relationship with current or former students.
Perlstein said Wednesday in an emailed statement, “I want to apologize deeply and genuinely for the harm I have caused to the women who shared their stories; to my students and the faculty and staff of CCSU; and most of all to my friends and family.” His full statement is below.
Delventhal could not be reached for comment.
Students relieved — and frustrated
Kileen Nadeau, left, and Anna Kelly have said they were the victims of  unwanted advances from CCSU Professor Joshua Perlstein when they were students at the university. Kileen Nadeau, left, and Anna Kelly have said they were the victims of  unwanted advances from CCSU Professor Joshua Perlstein when they were students at the university.
Several of the students who were interviewed by investigators and whose stories were told without names in the report have come forward in the past year to discuss their cases with reporters.  On Wednesday they expressed relief that the professors are not employed at the university any longer along with some frustration that Perlstein had not been fired.
Ashley Malloy, who says she is the student who had the long relationship with Perlstein — which lasted  off and on through the last 18 months of her college career and beyond — said, “Ultimately I think it’s great that [Perlstein] is not entrusted with the education of young people anymore, specifically young women, but this is not the ending I would have liked to have seen.”
Malloy said she would have liked to have seen Perlstein fired. The lack of that “punitive action” from the university toward him “is deeply upsetting,” she said.
Malloy said she was coerced into a relationship with Perlstein in 2013 when he was the advisor for her senior thesis and that she feared if she broke off her relationship with him, her academic career would be derailed. The investigation details emails between her and Perlstein, she said, which document the manipulative relationship in which she felt trapped.
“How do you say no to someone who has the power to alter your grades and affect the course of your future as an actor?” Malloy asked Wednesday. “You are trying to live out your dream and this person is carving out the path for you and you feel like if you deviate from what he wants, it could cost you something.”
Anna Kelly, another former CCSU student whose report of Perlstein’s sexual misconduct toward her was covered in the investigation, said “a big part of me is disappointed” that Perlstein was able to resign, rather than being fired.
She said, however, that she has been pleased with Toro’s response to the revelations. “I felt heard and I felt listened to,” Kelly said. And she has been happy about the speed with which Toro has made changes on campus.
Central Connecticut State University President Zulma R. Toro CCSU
In January, when the investigation was complete, Toro announced plans to reorganize the university’s human resources department after evidence showed that administrators for years failed to take proper action on complaints of sexual misconduct. The university president said at the time she was “disgusted and disheartened” by the findings that the two professors had “repeatedly engaged in sexual misconduct and inappropriate behavior with their students.”
“Also disturbing are the apparent failures by administrators who, over the years, did not protect our students,” Toro went on. “The findings pinpoint vital changes that are needed to ensure past misbehaviors, mistakes and inaction are not repeated at this university.”
Toro said she planned to appoint new leadership to the Office of Diversity and Equity, and on Wednesday a spokeswoman sent a statement saying that Nancy “Rusty” Barcelo, who most recently worked as a diversity consultant with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, will join CCSU in July to lead the Office of Diversity and Equity on an interim basis.
In a letter to the CCSU community, Toro also outlined other steps taken to improve the university’s systems, including hiring Sibson Consulting to help reengineer the Offices of Diversity and Equity and Human Resources and hiring two more staff members for the diversity and equity office. The maximum cost of Sibson’s work will be $170,000.
The university is also planning to implement an institution-wide reporting, monitoring,  and tracking system in the late fall to facilitate and maintain the collection of information, including complaints. And it has contracted with a company to design and administer a campus climate survey that will be done in September.
Here is the entire text of Joshua Perlstein’s statement: 
        I want to apologize deeply and genuinely for the harm I have caused to the women who shared their stories; to my students and the faculty and staff of CCSU; and most of all to my friends and family.
        In theatre, character is defined by what someone does under adverse circumstances. My experience at the Freedom Theatre in a refugee camp in Palestine showed me that even under the worst conditions, one can respond creatively and humanely. Bryan Stevenson, in his book JUST MERCY, reminded me that “no person should be judged by their worst act.” In order to insure that, I knew I must act creatively and give my time and energy in service of those in need. During the past 15 months I have trained in Restorative Justice techniques; volunteered in Hospice care; been certified as a Court Appointed Special Advocate through the Department of Children and Families; signed on to do literacy work in prisons; and most recently was accepted into the AmeriCorps program. I have had meaningful discussions with my two daughters about toxic masculinity and other issues affecting relationships in the current time. Finally I have sought the advice of a therapist to look deeply at the roots of my behavior.
            It would have been my preference to sit with those harmed in a mediated setting; to listen deeply to their stories; answer any concerns they have; and begin the process of repair with their needs in mind. In lieu of that I hope that my recent work will satisfy them. And if not I hope they will contact me and let me know what more  I can do.
            I look back on my years at CCSU with cherished memories. I wish the best for all whom I have impacted and all who have impacted me.

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to seek out such material.""My childhood and teen years put some context around what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday, July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City. Merrill, 58, whose CMU research included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not excuse such conduct.“I never harmed a child, but I understand children were abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said.Before Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material.“I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those individuals,” Merrill said.Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that Merrill’s collection depicted  children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90 percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon violence toward children, Dill said.Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU.In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year felony.Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous Merrill apologized to them and to CMU.Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds, said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment.Merrill told Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn.“I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child pornography,"" he said.Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records.A member of the university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff alerted university police of the content.Questioned by police, Merrill said he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have any more such material.Police in November executed a search warrant at Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers. Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487 images of child porn and 26 similar videos.Merrill resigned from his tenured position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor weapons offense.Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case.A federal grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012."

OLYMPIA — Central Washington University has fired professor and state Rep. Matt Manweller, R-Ellensburg, following its latest investigation into allegations of inappropriate behavior by the lawmaker.In a statement released Tuesday, the university said it wouldn’t make public an investigation report into the allegations until later this month, but that Manweller’s employment had ended.Manweller has blasted the university’s investigation, calling it politically motivated. In a text message Tuesday, Manweller wrote that he intended to file a lawsuit against the university and the investigator.“Over nine months ago the university communicated to me that they were going to terminate my employment regardless of what the investigation revealed,” Manweller wrote. “Today, they made good on that threat.”Manweller could authorize release of the report early. In a text message to The Associated Press, he said he has not yet decided whether to allow the early release of the report, or to seek an injunction to block it.The most recent investigation was completed last month by Trish Murphy of Northwest Workplace Law. While the university didn’t provide details about the investigation, its statement said Manweller “has been afforded all of his due process rights under the faculty collective bargaining agreement, including the right to union representation.”In previous years the university looked into two allegations of sexual harassment made against Manweller. The lawmaker, meanwhile, was the subject of another, separate complaint made last year at the Washington Legislature.#MeTooManweller is one of several current or former Washington legislators who have faced scrutiny in the wake of the #MeToo movement.The university’s action comes as lawmakers and officials in Olympia are grappling with how to strengthen a system to report complaints and hold accountable those found to have behaved inappropriately.In anticipation of the report becoming public, Manweller released a video earlier this month in which he criticized the investigation as politically motivated and accused officials of targeting him over trivial issues.“Let’s be clear: Central is not responding to allegations, they are manufacturing allegations,” Manweller said in the video.He said sexual harassment should be taken seriously but that it’s a disservice to the #MeToo movement if some of the issues raised in the report are considered harassment.“There is nothing in this report to apologize for,” he said. “The things that are true are not inappropriate. And the things that are inappropriate are not true.”Earlier this month, Manweller provided to reporters affidavits from two students, including one who wrote that Murphy “put words in her mouth” and she felt she was “being pressured into saying things that were not true.” Manweller said an additional student is set to sign an affidavit as well. Murphy declined to comment Tuesday, but in its statement, the university wrote that it stands by her “comprehensive investigative report and is confident that the report will withstand public scrutiny.”In its statement, the university said it “deeply regrets that Dr. Manweller has chosen to make public statements minimizing, trivializing, even ridiculing, the female students who have come forward with legitimate concerns.“The University trusts that the investigation report — and the University’s response — will fully address and validate the concerns of our students, and we thank them for their courage in coming forward,” the statement says.Manweller had been at the university since 2003 and worked as a political-science professor. A state lawmaker since 2012, he has been cruising toward re-election this year. He received more than 63 percent of the vote in last week’s primary. He advanced to the November ballot along with Democrat Sylvia Hammond.He also noted the strong support he received in the recent election, calling it “an overwhelming landslide.”“It is never easy to stand up to a bully but I’m glad the voters in the 13th district are supporting my efforts,” he wrote.InvestigationsThe latest investigation of Manweller began after a Seattle Times story in December that detailed two previous investigations conducted at CWU.In one of those, a student had reported that Manweller invited her to a bar in 2006 and propositioned her and a friend to have a threesome, according to records. In another, a student had reported that Manweller had made sexual comments, touched her leg and kissed her in his office.Manweller disputed the accounts but conceded he may have said something in the bar meeting that caused offense. The inquiries had concluded that there was evidence to suggest he had violated the school’s sexual-harassment policy, and the second investigation led the dean to issue a letter of reprimand and require that Manweller undergo sexual-harassment training, according to records.After the Times article, Manweller’s first wife said she believed Manweller was grooming her when she was a high-school sophomore and he was a teacher at her school. The two married in June 2000, shortly after her graduation.The Times also reported the account of a woman who worked at the Legislature and complained last year about his conduct.That woman reported that she had a meeting with Manweller that she thought was to be about her career, but she said it ended up feeling more like a date. She said Manweller steered the conversation toward personal issues, made what she thought were flirtatious comments, put her coat around her and opened the door to his car for her to get in.Manweller has said he was only being polite and trying to help the woman.CWU placed him on leave in December and began the new investigation. Manweller stepped down from his position as assistant floor leader in the state House.The Associated Press contributed to this report.

http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/education/2014/11/09/fired-ccc-official-accused-sexual-harassment/18758999/,"A Chemeketa Community College official, who was fired this year after a female employee accused him of sexual misconduct, had a sexual harassment complaint filed against him in 1999 when he worked at Lane Community College, the Statesman Journal has learned.A female employee raised concerns in 1999 that Lanning — then the division chairman of health, physical education and athletics at the college — was going to fire her for allegedly rejecting his sexual advances and questioning his integrity and decisions.""I had an enormous amount of respect for this man before all this began and now I do not trust him at all and even consider him to be a possible danger,"" the woman wrote in the complaint.The complaint was not upheld after a third-party investigation, according to documents released by the college from that year.The documents did not outline exactly why the complaint was unfounded. A lawyer for Lane Community College said there are no other records available related to the complaint the college could find. A call to Lanning's lawyer was not returned.The prior complaint came as a surprise to Chemeketa officials, who said they only recently learned about it after Lane responded to a public records request by the Statesman Journal. The college hired Lanning in 2007 after he worked at Lane for more than a decade. He became the college's Yamhill Valley Campus president in 2011.In May 2014, Lanning was the top pick to become the next president at Central Oregon Community College in Bend. But the college's board decided not to hire him after Lanning did not disclose to them he was on paid leave because of the complaint against him.A female employee, who is now suing the college and Lanning for at least $4.8 million in federal court, accused Lanning of raping her during an education conference in Portland. Lanning told a college investigator that what happened was consensual, but the college fired him in June after concluding he violated its sexual harassment policy.When COCC officials learned about the pending sexual misconduct complaint, it wasn't Chemeketa that tipped the college off.""That was a real dilemma for us and we chose to follow the advice our attorney that to do so would be violating Patrick's constitutional rights and potentially put us in a situation where the college might be subjected to litigation,"" said Greg Harris, a spokesman for Chemeketa.No known red flagsJeff Burgess, a training and development specialist with Oregon's Bureau of Labor and Industries, said it's unlikely an employer would find out about allegations against a prospective employee unless the claims were substantiated and he or she was disciplined.Typically, employers have the duty to disclose whether there is a propensity for violence, dangerous or criminal behavior, he said.""Employers kind of have to walk the fine line between respecting an employee's privacy and not divulging confidential information and limiting their exposure to a tort claim,"" he said.By revealing complaint information about an employee, it could sway the prospective employer's decision during the hiring process.""The concern for a lot of employers is by giving information about the existence of an investigation there might be a perception on the other end of the conversation that this person is guilty before they're proven innocent,"" Burgess said.Chemeketa found out about Lanning's prior sexual harassment complaint at Lane in late October, Harris said.""We had not heard about it at the time that he was hired. There was nothing provided to us from Lane that would indicate there was a problem,"" he said.The Statesman Journal submitted a public records request to Lane in May for any prior complaints filed against Lanning. The college initially told the newspaper there were no records, but when asked again about previous complaints, a new archivist was able to find one complaint using a different search method.At the time of the newspaper's request in May, the college had also just moved its archives into the basement of its former downtown Eugene instructional center.""As a result of her greater familiarity with both the physical archive files and the college's past archive practices, she was successful in locating one file responsive to your request,"" Meg Kieran, Lane Community College's lawyer wrote to the Statesman Journal on Oct. 31.The name of the woman who accused Lanning of sexual harassment was redacted from the documents.Lane Community College President Mary Spilde, who was vice president at the time the complaint was filed, said that without the investigation report she did not want to speculate about why it was unfounded.""I don't have the file either, so I can't refresh my memory about something that happened 15 years ago,"" she said.The college did a full investigation after the complaint was filed in 1999, Spilde said.""With no evidence to support a finding, the matter was closed. It would not be appropriate to share information about a complaint that was determined to be unfounded after a thorough process,"" she said.Former Chemeketa Community College President Cheryl Roberts worked with Lanning at Lane Community College.But the complaint was filed two years before she was hired by Lane Community College, according to her resume.""I had no idea. I had not heard anything about it when I was vice president there,"" Roberts said.When Lanning was first hired, Harris said, the college did a public records search into whether he had been arrested in the last seven years and conducted reference checks. Harris said once the college learned about the prior complaint at Lane, they went through records of Lanning's hiring process. The process is more rigorous now than it was the year Lanning was hired, he noted, with college officials talking to two direct supervisors of a prospective employee rather than just checking references provided to them by the candidate.They still could not find any red flags in Lanning's file.""We found nothing but positive recommendations,"" he said.A prior complaintIn 1999, a female employee filed a complaint to Lane Community College writing that she was uncomfortable with Lanning's flirting.""I believe Patrick Lanning has been harassing me in one form or another for a number of months now and I want this behavior to stop,"" she wrote. ""I would like to see him go through a complete psychological evaluation.""He told her that her voice sounded just as good on the phone as it did in person, suggested that he knew of a previous sexual encounter with an ex-boyfriend, told her that she was exactly like an ex-girlfriend of his and was inquisitive about her social life and men she was seeing, she wrote in the complaint.After a trip to Florence to meet a prospective instructor, she wrote in the complaint that she told Lanning she needed him to back out of her personal life.She then raised concerns about the hiring of a new prospective employee who she claims asked her and Lanning whether it would be known outside the college that she would be working with them.She raised other concerns, she wrote in the complaint, about the new employee including claims that she ignored students and made lengthy personal phone calls.""I informed Pat of these things but I felt my words were ignored,"" she wrote in the complaint.The woman who filed the complaint wrote that she was put on a 10-day trial period after Lanning alleged there were complaints about her from the faculty. The two had argued about office work, according to the complaint.""He has grown increasingly more erratic in his behavior and at the very least I want a full investigation into the allegations he had (lodged) against me and into his behavior,"" she wrote.On July 28, 1999, the woman received a letter from Lane Community College's President Jerry Moskus after the investigation was extended, potential witnesses were interviewed and the Sexual Harassment Hearings Committee met that month to review the complaint again.The complaint was not upheld.A history of sexual misconduct?A September lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court by the woman who accused Lanning of sexual misconduct in 2014 alleges that Chemeketa Community College was negligent, failing to protect her from sexual abuse when they knew of Patrick Lanning's ""history of sexual misconduct.""That includes Lanning's prior sexual harassment of another female employee at Chemeketa in 2012, the lawsuit states.In February, a college employee accused Lanning of raping her at a Portland hotel room following a night of drinking and socializing during an education conference Feb. 6 and 7.The alleged rape was reported to the Port of Portland Police Department that month, but no criminal charges were filed against Lanning.The Multnomah County District Attorney's Office did not pursue the case, stating in May there was ""insufficient evidence to prove a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.""Lanning also threatened to sue the college in July for a breach of employment contract, defamation and failure to pay wages. In September, Chemeketa paid Lanning $38,391 to prevent him from filing a lawsuit in what could have been a more costly trial.The Statesman Journal submitted a public records request for any complaints against Lanning filed in 2012, but was told there were no records responsive to the request.""We are quite clear and we have indeed looked and there is no record in our files of anyone filing a complaint like what was filed at Lane Community College,"" Harris said.qwong@statesmanjournal.com, (503) 399-6694 or follow at Twitter.com/QWongSJ.Technical Assistance for Employers ProgramThe Bureau of Labor and Industries runs a helpline that employers can call if they have questions about state and federal labor and employment laws.That phone number is 971-673-0824.Source: BOLI"

A famed architect and CUNY dean has been put on leave after a student accused him of ­unwanted advances.
George Ranalli, 68, who has helmed the Spitzer School of Architecture since 1999, offered Ariella Campisi a ride home after the faculty holiday party at the Smoke Jazz & Supper Club in December 2013, Campisi claims in a Manhattan federal-court lawsuit. Campisi, now 23, was there because she worked part-time as an office assistant for the architecture school.
During the 30 minutes they spent idling in traffic on the West Side Highway, Ranalli began rubbing her knee and thigh “in a sexual manner right below where her skirt ended,” she claims.
When the dean stopped downtown to drop off an adjunct professor also riding in the car, Campisi tried to flee. But the educator was insistent she stay: “You look so beautiful tonight. Can I kiss you?” he allegedly asked.
The “disgusted” girl ran to the nearest restaurant restroom and burst into tears, according to the legal filing against CUNY and Ranalli. She reported the incident to her bosses the next day, and they promised an investigation.
It was 18 months later when Campisi asked for an update, and learned there was no probe. Her bosses had incorrectly reported the incident to the school’s Human Resources office, instead of the Office of Diversity and Compliance.
She accuses CUNY of “deliberate indifference.”
Ranalli was put on administrative leave in April. He categorically denies the allegations, said his lawyer, Andrew Celli Jr.
CUNY investigated, and disciplinary proceedings against Ranalli are ongoing, a school spokesman said.

http://bangordailynews.com/2011/02/11/news/colby-professor-resigned-after-being-accused-of-videotaping-student-in-bathroom/,"

WATERVILLE, Maine — A tenured economics professor at Colby College has resigned and the Maine State Police Computer Crimes unit is investigating allegations he secretly recorded video of a female student in a bathroom while on a school trip to China.
The Morning Sentinel of Waterville says Philip Brown has not been charged with a crime.
On Jan. 28, Colby College President William Adams wrote students and staff that Brown had resigned after the college indicated it was prepared to fire him over a “violation of student privacy.”
An affidavit filed in court in Augusta says that on Jan. 22 two students on the China trip found computer images of a partially clothed female student.
Brown later told college officials the students’ allegations were true.
Brown could not be reached for comment.

http://www.gainesville.com/news/20160714/cf-professor-accused-of-sexual-battery-on-student,"Austin L. Miller Staff writerA 41-year-old assistant professor at the College of Central Florida was arrested Thursday morning on suspicion of sexual battery against a female student.Ryan Meany faces two counts of sexual battery. He was arrested around 9 a.m. and was released from the Marion County Jail at 4:34 p.m. on $30,000 bond. Meany denied a reporter's request for an interview.The incident allegedly occurred early Thursday morning, according to Ocala Police Department Detective Dustin Todd’s report.The woman — who is in her early 20s and is a former student of the communications teacher — told police she contacted Meany to meet for coffee and talk about a position she was interested in, the report states.Instead of coffee, she said, he suggested they meet for beer. She met him at The Crazy Cucumber in Ocala for beers and conversation.About an hour later, he suggested they go to O'Malley's Alley in downtown Ocala, where she had a few more drinks, according to the OPD report. She became sick and went to the bathroom to throw up.At one point, the woman said two other women entered the bathroom and asked her if she needed help, the report states. She said he came in and, while she was vomiting, smacked her buttocks and touched her inappropriately.The woman said she told Meany to stop and to call her boyfriend to come get her. She said Meany stopped and said he would take her home.Instead, he took her to his home on Northeast 17th Court.On the way, she said, he repeatedly asked her to spread her legs while he slapped her legs and groin area. The woman said she kept telling him no, according to Todd’s report.The woman said she asked why he didn’t take her home. He told her, the woman said, that she should come inside and he would call her boyfriend to come pick her up, the report states. He allegedly told her to be quiet because his girlfriend was sleeping.Lying on the couch, the woman said she felt sick. Meany removed her shorts, despite her telling him no, and had oral sex with her, according to Todd's report. She said Meany used her cellphone to call her boyfriend.When the boyfriend arrived, the woman overheard him asking Meany why her pants were down but Meany didn’t answer.Todd interviewed the boyfriend, who said he was aware of the meeting. The man said he became concerned when he got to Meany’s home and saw his girlfriend’s pants ""were undone,"" according to the report. The boyfriend said he questioned Meany about it but did not get an answer.After the incident was reported, Meany went to OPD, where he denied any inappropriate sexual contact with the woman. According to the report, however, Meany told the detective the woman ""may have sat on his face sexually at his house"" and that he ""may have accidentally"" touched her while her pants were down in the bathroom.Meany said the woman never said no — or yes — to him.Asked if CF would suspend — or take any action — against Meany, spokeswoman Lois Brauckmuller said the college had no comment. ""At the College of Central Florida, the safety of our college community it among our highest priorities. We will not comment on any ongoing investigation,"" she said.— Contact Austin L. Miller at 352-867-4118, austin.miller@ocala.com or @almillerosb."
https://www.ocala.com/news/20160927/ex-cf-prof-wont-be-charged-in-sex-case,"The State Attorney’s Office is declining to prosecute a former College of Central Florida assistant professor accused of sexually battering a student.Authorities arrested Ryan Meany, 41, in mid-July after a female student reported that he took advantage when the two met for drinks and discussion. She reported two instances of sexual contact — in a bar bathroom and at Meany’s home in Ocala — that she said were not consensual.In filing its determination in Meany’s case, Assistant State Attorney Debra Munchel wrote that additional witnesses and a laboratory analysis paint a more complete picture of the evening. This picture suggests the likelihood of conviction at trial is slight.CF placed Meany on administrative leave following his arrest. He subsequently resigned. The college's internal investigation into the matter is ongoing and independent of the criminal proceeding, a CF spokeswoman said on Tuesday.Much of what happened between Meany and the woman is not disputed, according to Munchel’s assessment. Both told authorities that they arranged to meet at the Crazy Cucumber about 8:30 p.m. July 13 to discuss an opportunity at the college. The conversation there skewed more personal over two or so drinks each, according to the document, and they agreed to continue the evening at O’Malley’s Alley about 10 p.m.The student became ill following more drinks at O’Malley’s, according to the document. She went to a bathroom at the bar to vomit. When the bar was closing, Meany and a security guard followed her, helped her off the floor, and walked her to Meany’s car.Once at Meany’s house, according to the document, Meany performed sex acts on the student. Afterward he called the student’s boyfriend who, according to the document, “took her to the hospital, called police department and instituted a report of sexual abuse on behalf of the victim.”The student reported that she did not consent to sex acts with Meany that night, including an instance she described in the bar bathroom in which she alleged that Meany digitally penetrated her.Meany initially denied any sexual contact while they were at his home. Later he said that “she may have sat on his face” and that she did not say “stop” or “no” while they were at his home.Of the bathroom incident, he told authorities that he pulled her pants up, because she was unable to do so herself, and that he “may have accidentally penetrated her while her pants were down.”Munchel references conversations with the bartender and Meany’s live-in girlfriend, who was at the home when the two returned to it that night, to clarify these events.The bartender said the student did not object to getting in Meany’s car, according to the document. The live-in girlfriend said she did not hear “anything from the victim that would indicate she was not enjoying herself.”Laboratory reports indicate that the student was not drugged that evening, according to the document, and the bartender’s statement suggests that her consumption of alcohol was voluntary.Voluntary intoxication, according to case law that Munchel cites in the document, does not render a person helpless and unable to communicate unwillingness to participate in a sex act.Munchel writes: “Since the victim was not physically helpless, but impaired by her own voluntary intoxication, if she did not consent to the sexual contact, she would have had to make that known to the defendant in order for the defendant’s actions to rise to the level of crime.”Contact Nicki Gorny at 352-867-4065, nicki.gorny@ocala.com or @Nicki_Gorny."

THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA
In The Court of Appeals
Dr. Robin
      Bowers, Appellant/Respondent,
v.
College of
      Charleston, Respondent/Appellant.
Appeal From the Administrative Law Court
 Marvin F. Kittrell, Chief Administrative
  Law Judge
Unpublished Opinion No. 2011-UP-569
Heard December 8, 2011  Filed December
  20, 2011  
AFFIRMED
Gregory Samuel Forman, of Charleston, for Appellant/Respondent.
Stephen L. Brown, Wilbur E. Johnson, and Russell G. Hines, all of
  Charleston, for Respondent/Appellant.
PER CURIAM:  In
  this cross-appeal, Appellant/Respondent Dr. Robin Bowers appeals from an order
  of the Administrative Law Court (the ALC) affirming Bowers' termination as a
  tenured professor at Respondent/Appellant College of Charleston (the College). 
  Bowers argues on appeal that the College denied him due process and there is no
  evidence to support the College's decision to terminate his employment.  On
  cross-appeal, the College argues the ALC erred by enforcing an automatic stay
  which required the College to pay Bowers' wages during the pendency of his
  appeal to the ALC.  We affirm.
1.  As to Bowers' argument that the College's grievance procedures
  denied him due process by placing an impermissible limitation on his counsel's
  participation, we find the issue unpreserved because Bowers did not object to
  the grievance procedures at either the prehearing conference or the hearing
  itself.  See Lee Cnty. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Trs. v. MLD Charter Sch.
    Acad. Planning Comm., 371 S.C. 561, 566, 641 S.E.2d 24, 27 (2007)
  (""[An appellate court] has a limited scope of review and cannot consider
  issues that were not raised to and ruled on by the administrative
  agency."").
2.  As to Bowers' argument that the complaints, text messages, and
  deposition were unreliable evidence and admitted upon an unlawful procedure, we
  find the issue unpreserved.  In regard to the complaints and text messages, we
  find the issue unpreserved because Bowers did not object to the admission of this
  evidence.  See Burke v. AnMed Health, 393 S.C. 48, 54, 710 S.E.2d 84, 87 (Ct. App. 2011) (providing a contemporaneous objection to the admission
  of evidence is typically required to preserve issues for appellate review).  As
  to the deposition of Raven Ray, the hearing committee informed the parties at
  the beginning of the hearing that Ray did not feel comfortable testifying
  unless her attorney was present.  The committee stated it had no objection to
  Ray's attorney observing the proceedings, but it would only allow Ray's
  attorney to do so if both parties agreed.  Bowers objected, and therefore the
  committee decided it would not allow Ray's attorney to be present.  Later in
  the proceedings, Bowers objected to the admission of Ray's deposition into
  evidence.  The committee decided to admit the deposition, finding Bowers had an
  opportunity to question Ray by either agreeing to allow her attorney to observe
  the proceedings or by submitting counter affidavits.  Bowers' attorney
  responded by saying she was unaware at the time she objected to Ray's attorney
  being present that the alternative was the committee would allow Ray's
  deposition in as evidence and Bowers would not have an opportunity to
  cross-examine Ray.  The committee explained it lacked subpoena power and again offered
  Bowers the opportunity to have Ray testify in the presence of her attorney.  After
  Bowers and his attorney discussed the matter, Bowers' attorney told the
  committee Bowers did not wish to delay the proceedings any further by having
  Ray testify and they were ready to continue.  The committee then asked Bowers
  if he would prefer to have Ray's deposition admitted into evidence rather than
  have her testify in the presence of her attorney.  Bowers responded by
  restating his objection to Ray's attorney being present and stated he just
  wanted to move along with the proceedings because he did not believe he would
  get much out of having Ray testify.  Bowers' attorney then said to Bowers,
  ""Sure, it's your case.""  We find Bowers waived his prior objection to
  the admissibility of the deposition by deciding he wanted to move along the
  proceedings when the committee yet again presented Bowers the option and
  opportunity to have Ray testify.  See CFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty.
    Assessor, __ S.C. __, 716 S.E.2d 877, 885 (2011) (holding CFRE waived on
  appeal its claim that the trial court erred by not sanctioning property tax
  assessor for its failure to formally respond to CFRE's interrogatories and
  production requests, where the trial court offered to continue the proceedings
  and order a formal response from the assessor, but CFRE declined the court's
  invitation and agreed that a continuance would be unlikely to produce anything
  further).
3.  As to Bowers' argument that he was not required to preserve
  issues related to his right to counsel or evidentiary procedures, we find the
  exception to the general rule of error preservation noted in Ex parte
    Jackson, 381 S.C. 253, 672 S.E.2d 585 (Ct. App. 2009), is not applicable in
  this case because Bowers had counsel present and actively representing him at
  all times during the prehearing conference and the hearing itself.  See id. at 261 n.3, 672 S.E.2d  at 589 n.3 (holding a pro se litigant could not be
  expected to raise the issue of whether he was entitled to counsel).
4.  As to Bowers' argument that the College denied him due process
  by not allowing him to confront Ray at the hearing, we find no error because Bowers'
  inability to cross-examine Ray was a result of his own conduct.  Ray agreed to appear
  and testify at the hearing so long as her attorney could be present.  Although
  the hearing committee explained to Bowers that Ray's attorney would be present
  in an observatory role only, Bowers did not agree to allow Ray's attorney to be
  present during her testimony.  Thus, Bowers' inability to cross-examine Ray was
  not a denial of due process.  See Zaman v. S.C. State Bd. of Med.
    Exam'rs, 305 S.C. 281, 285, 408 S.E.2d 213, 215 (1991) (holding a party
  cannot complain of a violation of due process if the party has recourse to a
  constitutionally sufficient administrative procedure, but merely fails to take
  advantage of it); In re Vora, 354 S.C. 590, 600, 582 S.E.2d 413, 418
  (2003) (""Due process is not violated where a party is not given the
  opportunity to confront witnesses so long as there has been a meaningful
  opportunity to be heard."").
5.  As to Bowers' argument that the record contains no evidence
  that his communications or actions towards Ray met the College's definition of
  ""sexual harassment,"" we find Ray's deposition, Bowers' text messages
  to Ray, and the lyrics of the poem posted on the internet, all provided evidence
  from which the College could reasonably find Bowers in violation of the College's
  sexual harassment policy.  See Risher v. S.C. Dep't of Health &
    Envtl. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 210, 712 S.E.2d 428, 434 (2011) (holding
  ""substantial evidence"" sufficient to support a finding of the ALC is
  evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds
  to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached); Spruill v.
    Richland Cnty. Sch. Dist. 2, 363 S.C. 61, 65, 609 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2005)
  (providing the appellate court traditionally defers to an agency's construction
  of its own regulation and the appellate court will not overturn such construction
  absent compelling reasons); ESA Servs., LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 392
  S.C. 11, 24, 707 S.E.2d 431, 438 (Ct. App. 2011) (holding a reviewing court may
  reverse or modify decisions that are controlled by error of law or are clearly
  erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the record as a whole).[1]
6.  As to the College's argument that the ALC erred by enforcing
  an automatic stay pursuant to ALC Rule 34, we find no error because enforcement
  of the stay merely held Bowers in the same position that he was in prior to his
  termination, on suspension with pay, pending the final decision of the ALC.  See ALC Rule 34 (""The filing of an appeal from the final decision of an agency
  shall stay the final decision of that agency . . . .""); Santee Cooper
    Resort, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 298 S.C. 179, 184, 379 S.E.2d 119,
  122 (1989) (""To stay an order is to hold it in abeyance or refrain from
  enforcing it; a stay is a stopping."" (internal quotations omitted)); Graham
    v. Graham, 301 S.C. 128, 130, 390 S.E.2d 469, 470 (Ct. App. 1990) (holding
  the purpose of a stay is to preserve the status quo pending the determination
  on appeal).
 AFFIRMED.
 HUFF,
  PIEPER, and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.  
[1] Because we find sufficient evidence to support the
  College's decision to terminate Bowers' employment for his violation of the
  College's sexual harassment policy, we need not address Bowers' remaining
  arguments regarding other grounds asserted by the College as justification for
  its decision.  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc.,
  335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing an appellate court need
  not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).

Philip L. Boroughs earlier this month, charging that Christie “is an imminent danger to students on your campus.”“Several of us were sexually abused by Prof. Christie while we were Holy Cross students,” the group wrote in its Aug. 3 letter. “Holy Cross has enabled Prof. Christie’s misconduct, and has a responsibility now to respond to our coming forward as quickly and decisively as possible.”Get The Big To-DoYour guide to staying entertained, from live shows and outdoor fun to the newest in museums, movies, TV, books, dining, and more.In a statement to the Globe on Thursday, Holy Cross said the college “was informed of allegations of serious misconduct and immediately placed Mr. Christie on administrative leave, in accordance with college policy. Mr. Christie had submitted a letter of resignation, and he will not be returning to the College.”An Oberlin spokesperson referred the Globe to a general statement dated Thursday on the school’s website regarding recent allegations of sexual misconduct against unnamed faculty members. In a Thursday e-mail to Oberlin students, staff, and faculty obtained by the Globe, conservatory dean Andrea Kalyn said the school’s Title IX officer recently received reports that Christie had allegedly violated Oberlin’s sexual misconduct policy.“Professor Christie was informed of these allegations and was placed on administrative leave pending an investigation,” wrote Kalyn. “He has resigned, and no longer teaches at Oberlin.”A Wellesley spokeswoman said the college has “no record of any complaints” against Christie, adding that in 2016 he was classified as an independent contractor there.Christie, 66, did not respond to multiple telephone and e-mail messages seeking comment.Christie, who was named International Performer of the Year for 2017 by the American Guild of Organists’ New York City Chapter, has performed with many of the world’s great orchestras during his long career. He has appeared on numerous recordings and has strong ties to the Boston area, where his work with the BSO has been singled out by reviewers in recent years.In a statement, a spokeswoman for the BSO said the orchestra had been unaware of the allegations against Christie, who performed with the orchestra as a freelance musician and has no formal title with the BSO.“The Boston Symphony Orchestra has never had complaints against Mr. Christie,” the statement read. “Mr. Christie is not on the schedule to perform with the BSO this upcoming season, and there are no plans to engage him for future performances with the orchestra.”In multiple interviews with the Globe, former students at Holy Cross and Oberlin described a consistent pattern of sexual harassment by Christie. Some said the organist used his considerable artistic standing to manipulate and cajole students, dangling before them entrance to some of classical music’s most rarefied circles. Former students also described a sexually charged environment that included lewd comments, large amounts of alcohol, and unwanted touching over a period between 1994 and 2017.Two of the former Holy Cross students who signed the letter also described long-term sexual relationships Christie initiated with them as undergraduates. The two men, who were younger than 21 at the time, said the relationships often involved heavy drinking and unprotected sex in a variety of public spaces, including green rooms, concert halls, Christie’s office at Holy Cross, and in and around the pipe organ at the school’s Saint Joseph Memorial Chapel.The Globe confirmed key elements of the former students’ accounts through e-mails, Facebook messages, and interviews with friends and acquaintances who either witnessed the events firsthand or learned of them soon after they occurred.The five signatories to the Holy Cross letter were all recipients of a prestigious organ scholarship at the school, a position that involves assistant duties and close study with Christie, who has served as distinguished artist-in-residence at the school for more than 30 years.The former students said Christie frequently injected sexual topics into conversation and often physically groped them, rubbing their thighs, proffering massages, and grabbing their rear ends.“I also heard descriptions of the size and shape of other men’s penises — other professors, concert organists, and students,” Jeff Wood, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2006 and went on to study with Christie at Oberlin, recalled in a written account of his experiences that he shared with the Globe and the Title IX office at Holy Cross.Brett Maguire (left), Jake Street, and Sean Redrow, seen at Holy Cross’s Saint Joseph Memorial Chapel, were among five former students to accuse James David Christie. Craig F. Walker/Globe StaffJake Street, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2010 and also went on to study with Christie at Oberlin, said Christie would often discuss his sexual conquests and the sexual anatomies and predilections of others.Street recalled a 2010 trip to Toronto where he and Christie drank heavily, eventually arriving one evening at his mentor’s hotel room.“At some point, my belt and zipper were undone, and my pants were down around my knees,” Street recalled in a written account of his experiences he shared with the Globe. He says he does not remember who removed his pants: “I remember him getting quiet in that moment, and I eventually fled.”Jennifer McPherson, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2013 and previously dated Street, recalled that Street told her about the experience after the Toronto trip.She added that Christie would often press her for information about her own sex life. “If I did not joke with him in return, he would then say I was prudish and should experiment more,” McPherson recalled in a written statement. “Sex was one of his favorite subjects. If I wanted to be a part of Jim’s ‘circle,’ I had to play along.”Wesley Hall, who studied extensively with Christie at Oberlin despite what he called the organist’s repeated unwanted physical contact, put it succinctly: “He’s the best organ teacher in America, and he could destroy your dreams.”Hall, who said he has spoken with the Title IX office at Oberlin, added: “He has asked me at least 10 times in lessons if I wanted to take my shirt off.”Sean Redrow first met Christie when he was an aspiring organist in high school, practicing before a master class with Christie.He was soon taking lessons with Christie, securing the coveted organ scholarship to Holy Cross starting in 1994.The relationship quickly went beyond mere touching at the keyboard, as Christie lavished praise and affection on his young student, telling him he was a rare talent and giving him a glimpse of life as a musician of international renown: “money, power . . . the College job at the school I loved more than anyplace or anything ever. He said he’d give it to me when he retired,” recalled Redrow in a written statement. “I would have to be prepared to give up all of my connections to family and friends because being an artist of my caliber would require frequent travel and/or moving to different parts of the country and globe in order to live up to my gift.”Redrow said the relationship soon turned sexual and involved heavy drinking. “We’d have some drinks, or wine, and then we would have sex,” said Redrow, adding that some of the episodes occurred at the home of Christie, who then lived in Newton.In one episode, Redrow recalled he and Christie were helping tune the organ at the Holy Cross chapel.“He took his penis out of his pants, started stroking it, and saying, ‘Come on,’ ” recalled Redrow, who said his professor was urging him to perform fellatio.Brett Maguire, who graduated from Holy Cross in 2002 and went on to study with his mentor at Oberlin, said Christie told him about the episode with Redrow in the organ loft.Maguire explained that the first gay sexual experience of his own life was with Christie, initiated by his teacher.“Christie has amazing artistic privilege . . . at Holy Cross to hand select from the most talented young organ students, to groom them as he sees fit,” Maguire said in a statement. “He has abused this position, using his power of selection to surround himself with insecure young men — teenagers — to satisfy his sexual appetites.”Malcolm Gay can be reached at malcolm.gay@globe.com.

https://www.telegram.com/news/20190620/holy-cross-finds-former-college-organist-sexually-harassed-students,"WORCESTER - The College of the Holy Cross has completed an investigation into sexual misconduct allegations against former college organist James David Christie and found Mr. Christie subjected students to “prohibited sexual harassment,” according to a notice from the college that was emailed to complainants last week.The penalties to be brought by the college include a black mark on Mr. Christie’s employment record, a permanent ban from campus, and revocation of any past honors and awards. Restitution for the victims remains to be determined.More:Professor accused of sexual misconduct no longer at Holy CrossThe college will issue a public statement to the Holy Cross community announcing the ruling and penalties against Mr. Christie as soon as a period set aside for appeals has concluded, a spokesman for the college, John Hill, said Thursday.Two of the alumni who made the accusations against their former organ teacher commented Thursday: ""Holy Cross reached the only result it could - that James David Christie violated College policy.""The College has indicated it will now discuss remedial measures with us,"" the two former students, Jacob Street and Sean Redrow, said in a joint text message. ""We are waiting to see if the College, as Christie's employer, takes substantive responsibility for Christie's egregious misconduct and its impact on all of us.""Mr. Street and Mr. Redrow were among five former holders of the college’s coveted Organ Scholarship who last summer publicly accused Mr. Christie, the college’s distinguished artist-in-residence and one of the most acclaimed organists of his generation, of sexual misconduct.Mr. Christie resigned and was barred from campus. Holy Cross launched what the college’s president, the Rev. Philip Boroughs, pledged would be an “aggressive and thorough” review of the allegations against the organist, who was accused of having pressed himself sexually on student proteges, even in the organ loft of the campus chapel.Tracy Kennedy, director of the college’s Office of Title IX Initiatives, responsible for investigating reports of sexual misconduct on campus, sent an email June 14 to the former students who had lodged the complaints against Mr. Christie, summarizing the findings of the investigation and the sanctions to be assigned.Mr. Redrow posted excerpts to his Facebook page on Saturday. “HC Title IX has spoken,” he wrote. “Our part still to be figured out.” The Telegram & Gazette independently verified the content of the email the Holy Cross administrator sent the complainants.Ms. Kennedy wrote that an investigatory panel had concluded that Mr. Christie - never named in the communication, but referred to only as “the Responding Party” - had engaged in unwelcome and inappropriate behavior of a sexual nature that constituted prohibited sexual harassment.She described the sanctions handed down: Mr. Christie’s employment record with the college would reflect he had been terminated for cause; a campus no-trespass order against him would be made permanent; and any past awards or honors to him from the college would be revoked.She wrote that Mr. Christie did not elect to participate in the investigation or resolution process, was not interviewed, and did not review or respond to the investigation report. He cannot appeal the result.Mr. Christie, 67, of Natick, has been influential in classical music circles as an organist for the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Wellesley College, as well as Holy Cross and Oberlin College.In August, the former Organ Scholars wrote to Rev. Boroughs and told their story to The Boston Globe, which reported their allegations of lewd comments, unwanted touching and sexual misconduct by Mr. Christie at Holy Cross between 1994 and 2017.Oberlin College in February announced the results of its own investigation into similar allegations against Mr. Christie, finding the organist “in all likelihood grossly abused his position of trust.” According to a former student, Mr. Christie’s nickname at the Ohio college was “the Harvey Weinstein of the Music Department.”Phone and email messages to Mr. Christie this week were not returned. Contacted in person at his home in South Natick in November, he declined to comment.The former Holy Cross Organ Scholars who raised the allegations are Mr. Redrow (class of 1998), Mr. Street (class of 2010), Jeffrey Wood (class of 2006), Brett Maguire (class of 2002) and Jennifer McPherson (class of 2013).Holy Cross’ Organ Scholarship, traditionally awarded every other year to a talented music major, provides full tuition (currently more than $52,000 annually) for four years, and is highly coveted. CBS New York has described it as “perhaps the most prestigious scholarship for the organ in America.”With the scholarship comes the responsibility of playing the 52-foot-high, 10-ton baroque pipe organ in Holy Cross’ St. Joseph’s Chapel at Masses and other college events, and assisting the college organist with all aspects of the chapel music program.Until last summer, that meant studying and working closely with Mr. Christie, who had been considered one of the most distinguished organ teachers in the nation, influential in the making of aspiring musicians’ careers.The accusations against Mr. Christie were the first in a series of allegations of faculty sexual misconduct that have roiled the campus of New England’s oldest Jesuit college over the past year.Misconduct claims also were made public against Christopher Dustin, a philosophy professor who was removed as dean of faculty and placed on leave after allegations were brought to light of unwanted sexual advances made upon former students.Meantime, students demanding greater transparency about sexual assault at the college created an Instagram page for posting anonymous accounts of date rape on campus, and in February staged a two-day sit-in outside the office of the college president.In April, Rev. Boroughs declined to retain an independent investigator to look into allegations of faculty sexual misconduct at the college, despite being urged to do so by faculty leaders. The Faculty Assembly voted to call on the board of trustees to appoint an independent counsel nonetheless.Last month, 87 members of the faculty signed a letter describing frustration at what was termed the administration’s “unwillingness to answer questions central to this brewing crisis.” Many faculty members at the college’s 173rd commencement exercises wore teal stoles with their academic regalia as a mark of solidarity with survivors of harassment and assault.Video: Worcester By Bike "

THE ""SLOCUM AFFAIR"" AT COLORADO COLLEGE
 
 
William F. Slocum was president of Colorado College from 1888-1917. During his presidency, the college grew from 50 students to 500 and from a single building to sixteen. His wife, Mary Slocum, founded the Woman's Educational Society at CC. After an investigation into his behavior with women at the college (students, staff, faculty, and faculty wives), the Board of Trustees asked for and received Slocum's resignation. He spent the 1916-1917 school year abroad and officially left CC after the 1917 commencement celebration.

EXCERPTS FROM WOMEN'S STATEMENTS selected and with occasional paraphrases (in brackets) by CC archivist Jessy Randall, 2017.

Maude S. Bard [CC class of 1912, secretary to the president 1912-1916, later wife  of CC professor Edward R. Warren]:
When I came  to the College in the spring of 1908, was warned by Miss Stevenson, as to what  I should expect from the President.
  When I  returned in September, 1912, Mrs. Bushee also warned me, as she, too, had had  to protect herself against Mr. Slocum.
 At first I  felt the protestations of love for me were genuine, and that it was incumbent  upon me, to try to save him from himself, and to save his self-respect. It  gradually dawned upon me, that I was dealing with a man of strong and evil  passions and that my only effort must be to protect myself.
 As two  evidences of the struggle which ensued, I cite the following:
 One  afternoon in the Spring of 1913, in the President’s office, at Palmer Hall, Mr.  Slocum took me by the shoulders, forced me to stand against the east wall of  his office, and pressed his whole body against mine, especially emphasizing the  pressure at the portion of his body and mine most calculated to arouse and  satisfy physical passion. I struggled to free myself, and fled from the office.  This particular form of bestiality he never attempted again.
 On  commencement day of this year, June 9, 1915, I was in the library of the President’s  home, when I fainted. A doctor was summoned, who directed I should lie on the  couch, until my own doctor could come to me. A woman friend was left to watch  me, while Mr. & Mrs. Slocum went to the Alumni Banquet at Cossitt Memorial.  Between courses the President came to his house to see me. Bending over the  couch, with back to the other persons in the room, he inserted his hand under  the clothing covering my chest, and stating that the doctor had told him to  watch my heart action, passed his hand again and again over me, as far down as  he could reach. I tried to protect myself by pushing him away as much as my  condition would permit. The next day he reminded me of this effort on my part,  and told me I had been a prude. This happened at my home on the next morning  after I had fainted. Mr. Slocum called to see me and was left alone with me. I  was in bed being too weak to get up. He repeated the insult of the day before,  still under the cover of the necessity of watching the heart action. Then  suddenly he stooped over me, laid his hand on my chest, and exclaimed, “Oh, I  love you so!”
  These are  two or three instances of the President’s persecution of a woman who works for  him. I can give others, but none more flagrant. I also know, from my personal  observation, that the women students in the college are not safe alone with the  President in his office.

 
Supplement of Miss Bard’s statement by Jean Auld [CC class of 1908; instructor  in Greek and Latin 1909-1911]:
Yes, I  remember the incident you speak of, though of course I couldn’t see it all. I  remember I was astonished and shocked at his manner. He sat down on the couch  beside you, as I recall it, and bent down over you very close while he felt  your pulse. Then he remarked that he was a physician, too, and added something  in an undertone which I couldn’t catch. I then saw him thrust his hand under  your clothes to feel your heart. That of course was all I could see, except  your expression of repugnance.

 
 
 
Harriet Sater [CC cashier, 1910-1918]:
 To feel  that I have not only been insulted once, but many times, has been a thing which  I have had to live with mentally. I have had to put up with “handling,”  insinuating looks and insidious familiarities, in many of the private  interviews which I have had with him, in obeying his wanting “to see me for a  few minutes.” I am unable to express the looks which have left me boiling with  a sense of shame and disgrace. The constant need of having his hand on your  body, feeling it, are things a woman cannot mistake. A constant desire to  always bring the physical side in is always present. [...] Another illustration [...]  at the end of a normal conversation, when he asked me if I was engaged, I  answered “No,” and like a flash the lights were turned off, and before I was  aware of what was happening, I was seized in his arms, and he said, “You have  got to kiss me.” The lights were turned off another time, but the second time I  was prepared. [...] I have been talked to on “cold-heartedness,” which was purely in  a physical way.

 
      Anonymous former secretary to the president:
Twice, much against my will, I was obliged to telephone (in  Mrs. Slocum’s absence) for Miss [name not given in transcription] to come down  from [place not given] on “important business.” Mrs. [name not given] told me  that Miss [name not given] spent the night at the Slocum house. When Miss [name  not given] was in evidence, I was moved into another office [...] to get me out of  the way.


 
Anonymous former instructor:
Of course I have known for a long time that Pres. Slocum has  a most disgusting attitude toward women who are unsuspicious, young, and thrown  into contact with him [...] Dr. Slocum made himself extremely disagreeable to me  for the first few weeks, cropping into my room in [name not given], late in the  evening, and saying many sentimental and silly things. I was young then and  felt very guilty, as though I had brought such familiarity on myself, and I  finally asked [name not given] about it. She told me that the experience was  fairly common [...] By never staying in my room alone in the evening the difficulty  finally relieved itself [...] I could not repeat anything he said. The impression  of him, however, is a very horrid one, and the trapping feeling when he took  advantage of his age and position and his friendship for my family, I can  assure you I have never forgotten.
 


Anonymous graduate:
I sat quite close to his desk in the chair he placed for me.  In the midst of the conversation he suddenly stopped, and leaning down, began  to look at me in a way which I cannot describe in any words save bestial [...] I  left the room at once. He simply sat at his desk and watched me go. I was never  alone with him after that [...] such a man has no right to occupy a position of  power over the lives of young men and young women, who are bound to hold him in  honor and respect.
 
 
        Anonymous student:
The first act of President Slocum which attracted my  attention was a too minute and familiar examination of a brooch I was wearing.  Soon after that he had me blot checks for him on several occasions [...] he said he  would find out when I was scheduled for office work and sign checks at those  times. One these occasions he seemed to wish the door to his office closed,  wanted me to sit very near him, and would look at my wrist watch now and then,  each time laying his hand on my hand or wrist [...] the expression of the man’s  eyes, when he looked at me, offended and horrified me. These instances appear  trivial to my reason, but [...] I have lain awake nights with the thing on my mind.
 



        Irma K. Persons [wife of Warren Persons, Dean of Business  Administration 1912-1918]:
[After a college dinner at the Acacia Hotel, Mrs. Persons  accompanied an injured Mrs. Slocum home. When Mrs. Slocum was settled, she  entered a dark room with Dr. Slocum to get her coat.] He put his arm around me  and then the first thing I knew he kissed me, on the mouth, and in the act our  eyeglasses became entangled. He turned on the lights to find our glasses and I  got out of the room. He was all this time calling me endearing terms [...] He  wanted to take me home, but I insisted on being taken back to the hotel, where  Mr. Persons was. From his house to the hotel he drove just as slowly as was  possible, all the while calling me endearing names, trying to hold my hand [...]  and several times he put his arms around me.
 


 
Florence Leidigh [CC class of 1902, assistant to Dean of Women Ruth Loomis 1902]:
During the early days of my freshman year, I was horrified at the discovery that the College's President was a man who made shocking advances to students and other women. One of my intimate friends [...] told me of her fear at being left alone with Dr. Slocum, even for a moment. If so left in a room of his own home, she was invariably made to submit to the most startling caresses. My greatest shock, however, came with the knowledge, that the President, almost every evening, was in the closed rooms of one of the officials of the girls' hall -- often remaining until after midnight [...] I could continue indefinitely with tales of young girls who  had horrifying experience with their president: one in a public train, another  in a closed carriage [...]
 
 
 
ALSO FROM THE KERR PAPERS

Statement made by Dean Edward S. Parsons at the joint  meeting of the Trustees and Faculty  August 28, 1916:
The first time the rumors began to come to me about Mr.  Slocum was about ten years ago. At that time there were relations with a lady,  who was a member of the faculty, which seemed to be foolishness, but were  entirely out of accord with the doctrines of the right relations of the sexes  preached from the chapel desk and in social committee meetings. Then perhaps  five or six years ago I began to hear more definite things concerning the  relations of Mr. Slocum to women members of the faculty, secretaries, and  students [...] [Parsons consults with Professor Schneider, who has some medical training. Schneider] felt that the dangers were very  great and could not be overlooked, that there was a pathological condition [...] [Parsons speaks with CC Trustee Philip B. Stewart, who said]  many men  do the things which Mr. Slocum had done and are not caught, but Mr. Slocum had  been caught, and he simply could not be retained in his present position [...]
 

 
Letter from Colorado Springs lawyer Charles W. Haines to Kerr, August 17, 1917:      
Our ""esteemed contemporary"" is suffering from acute  Erotomania. Medical men, one at least, here recognize it. How far 'tis a  misfortune (weakness, physical) and how far ""sin,"" I cannot be called upon to  decide, but I am clear in my mind that 'tis venial compared with chronic lying,  hypocrisy, and hideous selfishness -- itself conceit.

 


Other primary sources on the Slocum Controversy: 
Guy Harry Albright Papers, Ms 0389, Colorado College Special Collections, Box 1, Folder 3: letter from Albright to Paul Peck, October 23, 1917. Scan of typed transcription (CC Information File  Faculty-Bio-Parsons, Edward S., appendix to Fauvel article):
The fact was that Slocum was an erotic. No woman was safe from insult when left alone with him. Stories by the hundreds and affidavits by the dozen poured in proving that college girls, women secretaries, wives of professors, married women in town, pretty or homely, old or young, all were liable to shocking caresses and suggestive language from Slocum. Someway, while rumors had been abroad for many years, nobody dared expose the old libertine. His position and his power as well as women's modesty protected him through twenty-seven years in Colorado Springs. He was hated by students and distrusted by faculty folk because of his faithlessness, his lying, and his double-dealing. But until these young women were goaded to speak, no one had the courage to attack him. 
 

 
Julia Hassell Lipsey interview, 1977, Colorado College Oral History Collection R15. Lipsey was a member of the class of 1917 at CC.  Short excerpt in MP3 format.
[The faculty] said to the trustees, ""Look how this man is -- he's a  perfect hypocrite, and look at these actions with these secretaries,"" and  so forth, ""get rid of him."" And the secretaries, or some of the  trustees would say, ""Well, look at what he's done for the college. He's built up the college; he has a vast  number of wealthy friends, and provides for the college. That sort of thing happens in offices, business offices all the time,  now just don't talk about it.""

812 F. Supp. 413 (1993)
Sharon KARIBIAN, Plaintiff,
v.
COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, John Borden and Mark Urban, Defendants.
No. 91 Civ. 3135 (TPG).
United States District Court, S.D. New York.
February 3, 1993.
*414 Elizabeth L. Koob, Koob & Magoolaghan, New York City, for plaintiff.
Diane S. Wilner, Wilner & Associates, P.C., New York City, for Columbia and Borden.
Corwin & Solomon, New York City, for Urban. 

*415 OPINION
GRIESA, District Judge.
This is a sexual harassment case. There is a claim against Columbia University under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq. There are also various claims against Columbia under state law theories. Defendants Borden and Urban are sued solely under state law theories.
Defendants Columbia and Borden move for summary judgment. The motion is granted. For reasons hereafter set forth, the Title VII claim against Columbia must be dismissed because there is no triable issue of fact. As to the state law claims against Columbia and the claims against Borden, there is no jurisdiction after dismissal of the Title VII portion of the action.
Although Urban has not made a motion, the court dismisses the action against him on its own motion, for lack of jurisdiction. 
FACTS
In late 1986 while plaintiff was a student at Columbia, she obtained part-time employment with the University. The office she worked at was called ""Telefund at Columbia University."" Although it was part of the University, its activities were to some extent designed and administered by a separate company called Philanthropy Management, Inc. (""PMI""). The people working at Telefund consisted of both Columbia University employees and PMI employees. Telefund operated under the aegis of an entity at Columbia called University Development and Alumni Relations (""UDAR"").
Defendant Urban was employed by Columbia University commencing in September 1987. He worked in UDAR and his duties included responsibility for Telefund. Borden was Deputy Vice President of UDAR from April 1, 1988 until sometime in 1991. He was Urban's superior.
Plaintiff alleges that she met Urban in the spring of 1987, before Urban went to work for Columbia. She alleges that Urban pressured her into having sexual relations commencing shortly after they met and continuing through 1989.
Columbia has an established mechanism for dealing with sexual harassment. Columbia publishes a bulletin entitled ""Protection Against Sexual Harassment."" The bulletin starts with a Policy Statement, which includes the unequivocal declaration that ""the University prohibits sexual harassment of any member of the Columbia community."" The bulletin describes remedies provided by the University. A person who believes that he or she is being sexually harassed is invited to confer with a member of the University Panel on Sexual Harassment. There is also provision for the aggrieved party (or the panel member with permission of the aggrieved party) to discuss the problem with the University's Office of Equal Opportunity and Affirmative Action (""EOAA""). Finally, the party alleging sexual harassment may file a grievance under the applicable University grievance procedure.
It is agreed by both sides that the first two steps  i.e., resort to the University Panel on Sexual Harassment or resort to the EOAA  are entirely confidential. This means that there is no effort to investigate the matter or to obtain a remedy against the alleged guilty party. The grievance procedure, on the other hand, is not confidential and sets in motion an investigation and other steps which may lead to remedial action against the party complained of.
During September 1988 plaintiff consulted with one of the members of the Sexual Harassment Panel and also with an employee at the EOAA. Plaintiff concedes that she knew that these consultations were confidential. The EOAA employee has stated, without contradiction, that plaintiff specifically requested that there be no investigation at that time. The sexual relations between plaintiff and Urban continued.
Plaintiff claims that in April 1989, after Urban allegedly forced her to perform a sexual act, she related this incident to Loren Spivack, an employee of PMI. Plaintiff asserts that Spivack informed her that he had relayed the information to the president *416 of PMI, Ron Erdos. Plaintiff goes on to assert her belief that the Erdos in turn reported the incident to defendant Borden.
Plaintiff's statement under Local Civil Rule 3(g) alleges that defendant Borden knew or should have known that plaintiff was subjected to sexual harassment since at least April 1989. Borden's 3(g) statement asserts that he did not learn about plaintiff's complaint until 1990.
It should be noted that the presentations of all parties on the motion for summary judgment are based mainly on the extensive depositions taken in the case.
No deposition of Spivack or Erdos was taken. At least, there is no reference to such deposition testimony in the present motion. Borden's deposition was taken. Plaintiff's attorney asked Borden if he knew about a ""nonbusiness relationship"" between plaintiff and Urban, to which Borden replied that, when Urban recommended plaintiff for a promotion in late August 1989, Urban said that he and plaintiff had dated but that they were no longer dating. Borden testified that he learned nothing further until January 1990.
Thus there is no support in Borden's deposition or in any other evidence for the idea that Borden learned of the problem in April 1989. Plaintiff's proposition to this effect is entirely speculative.
After April 1989 sexual relations between plaintiff and Urban continued. On January 30, 1990 plaintiff met with Gertrude de la Osa, Director of Development Services at UDAR and complained about sexual harassment by Urban. The matter was promptly reported by de la Osa to Borden. An investigation was immediately conducted by Borden with the assistance of the Office of General Counsel of the University.
By early March Urban was relieved of any supervisory role with respect to plaintiff. In April 1990 Urban's resignation was requested and given. He left the University at that time. 
DISCUSSION
A sexual harassment claim under Title VII may be based on either of two theories: (1) ""quid pro quo"" or (2) hostile work environment. See Meritor Savings Bank, FSB v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64-65, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404-2405, 91 L. Ed. 2d 49 (1986).
In order to prevail on a quid quo pro theory, the plaintiff must show an actual  rather than threatened  economic loss because of gender or because a sexual advance was made and rejected. Plaintiff produces no evidence demonstrating that she was denied an economic benefit. In fact, during the period of the alleged harassment, plaintiff was promoted from clerical worker to Project Director of Telefund. Her salary also increased. The court finds that there is no indication of any valid claim under the quid pro quo theory.
The allegations under the hostile environment theory must be dealt with in more detail. In the motion for summary judgment, Columbia does not attempt to disprove the allegations of misconduct against Urban. Columbia's position is that, even if Urban committed the misdeeds alleged, Columbia is not liable.
The Supreme Court has not established a definitive rule for employer liability, but has directed lower courts to draw from traditional agency principles. Vinson, 477 U.S.  at 72, 106 S. Ct.  at 2408. The Second Circuit has interpreted this guideline to mean that a plaintiff must prove ""that the employer either provided no reasonable avenue for complaint or knew of the harassment but did nothing about it."" Kotcher v. Rosa & Sullivan Appliance Center, Inc., 957 F.2d 59, 63 (2d Cir. 1992).
There is no basis for any contention that Columbia University failed to provide a reasonable avenue for making complaints. The only possible ground for holding Columbia liable is that it knew of the misconduct of Urban and failed to take remedial steps.
In this connection, plaintiff contends that Columbia knew of the sexual harassment in September 1988, at the time of her consultations with the Sexual Harassment Panel *417 and with the EOAA. Plaintiff contends that, despite this knowledge, Columbia did nothing about the problem. Plaintiff further contends that Columbia knew about the difficulty in April 1989 when she described it to Spivack of PMI. Plaintiff contends that again Columbia failed to perform its duty to take remedial action.
The information which certain Columbia employees learned in September 1988 was obtained in the course of consultations which were intended to be completely confidential. It cannot be said that this was ""knowledge"" on the part of Columbia of the kind that gave Columbia the duty to inquire and take remedial action. Plaintiff chose these confidential procedures instead of availing herself of the right, offered by the University, to file a grievance and initiate an investigation leading to a possible remedy against Urban. Columbia could hardly be expected to act against Urban as a result of the confidential consultations of September 1988.
In connection with plaintiff's claim that Columbia should have taken action in April 1989, the essential fact is that plaintiff spoke to an employee of a separate company, PMI, and did not speak to anyone at Columbia. Despite an extensive deposition record, there is absolutely no evidence that any PMI employee notified Borden or anyone else at Columbia of what plaintiff said.
Plaintiff contends that notice to PMI was the equivalent of notice to Columbia, and that PMI's knowledge should be taken to be the knowledge of Columbia. The court rejects this theory. PMI was a small company performing a service as an independent contractor to Columbia. It was not responsible for policing the problems arising between one Columbia University employee and another. If PMI had reported the matter, it would have involved going over Urban's head to someone such as Borden, and relaying a complaint about Urban. Perhaps this would have been a worthy thing to do, but PMI had no legal duty to do so, and indeed had economic reasons for minding its own business.
But overriding all of this is the salient fact that plaintiff had the ability in April 1989 or at any time to go directly to Columbia with her complaint. She did not have to rely on the uncertain, indirect channel of PMI. Under all the circumstances, the court rules that notice to PMI was not notice to Columbia and that PMI's knowledge was not the knowledge of Columbia. The events of April 1989 did not impose on Columbia any duty to take remedial action against Urban.
The first time that plaintiff made a complaint of such a nature as to require action on the part of Columbia was in late January 1990. When this occurred Columbia took prompt and effective remedial action. Within a reasonable time plaintiff was removed from Urban's supervision. Shortly thereafter Urban's employment was terminated.
The court rules that Columbia had no duty to investigate, or to take remedial action, until plaintiff made her complaint in late January 1990. Columbia's response to that complaint was prompt and effective. Columbia has demonstrated that it is not liable under Title VII and that there is no triable issue of fact on this claim.
Brief note must be made of a retaliation claim of plaintiff. It appears that plaintiff was terminated in August 1990 along with all other employees working on the Telefund operation. Plaintiff makes a conclusory, totally unsupported allegation that this was in retaliation for her sexual harassment complaint. Columbia has produced conclusive evidence that the Telefund program was cancelled for independent business reasons. The evaluation of the Telefund operation had been going on since the summer of 1989 and in the summer of 1990 a UDAR employee named Veronica Chappelle recommended that the Telefund operation be ended.
In late 1990 Columbia accepted the offer of a different company than PMI to make Columbia a demonstration site for computerized telephone fund raising. This project was developed at no cost to Columbia. Plaintiff admits that she reviewed certain *418 published public listings of job openings for this project, but did not apply. 
CONCLUSION
Columbia is entitled to summary judgment dismissing the Title VII claim.
The only basis for jurisdiction over the other claims against Columbia is the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction. All the claims against Borden and Urban are before the court solely on the basis of pendent jurisdiction.
Since the Title VII claim against Columbia is dismissed, there is no basis for asserting jurisdiction over the remaining claims.
The action is dismissed in its entirety.
SO ORDERED.

http://nypost.com/2017/10/03/esteemed-columbia-professor-accused-of-sexually-harassing-student/,"
An elderly professor who’s been teaching at Columbia University for more than 50 years preyed on a female doctoral student and sexually harassed her for two years, a new lawsuit alleges.
The now 29-year-old woman claims the harassment began when she was a graduate student in 2014, when William V. Harris, a celebrated history professor and longtime program director at the school, duped her into believing he was a trusted confidant, according to the Manhattan federal court complaint filed Monday.
After inviting the woman to work for him, the then 75-year-old educator began coming onto her — inappropriately groping and kissing her in his office while pressuring her to have sex with him, the suit alleged.
He also asked that she send him “sexually explicit emails.”
Harris, who specializes in ancient Greek and Roman history, allegedly told the woman that she was being “too emotional” when she complained about his unwanted passes.
Things turned sour after the anonymous woman withdrew from her work with Harris, as well as from Columbia, during the 2015-16 school year to seek counseling for her extreme “psychological distress.”
That’s when the geriatric professor began badmouthing her to other staffers and students, saying she dropped out without due cause.
The woman, who still teaches at the Ivy League school, said Columbia was well aware of Harris’ predatory behavior, which has been going on for “decades,” but that the school turned a “blind eye” to it.
She also claimed Harris targeted many other female students.
“When students have reported sexual harassment to Columbia’s administrators, officers, and employees …Columbia has shown deliberate indifference to their complaints,” the suit said.
In an email, Harris said he had no comment on the allegations.
“We treat any claim of harassment or other gender-based misconduct in our community with the utmost seriousness, but we do not comment in the press on allegations made in legal complaints,” Columbia said in a statement.
“Columbia pays lip service to the ideals of a safe campus,” said David Sanford, one of the woman’s lawyers. “However, the institution has demonstrated deliberate indifference to complaints of sexual harassment. Jane Doe is now among the women harmed by Columbia University trustees’ callous disregard for students’ safety, psychological health, and emotional well being.”

Columbia University lost its second professor this week to accusations of sexual misconduct by former students, in a wave of investigations into sexual harassment by university officials and faculty at American campuses.	
Thomas Roma, director of Columbia's photography program since 1996, resigned effective immediately after five women came forward with allegations reported Wednesday in the New York Times. The university conducted internal investigations into the allegations when they were originally made over 15 years ago, and found in at least one case that both the alleged victim and Roma were responsible for the incident.
This comes after tenured history professor William Harris retired last month following accusations by an anonymous female graduate student that he had pursued nonconsensual sexual contact since 2012.
Meanwhile, Todd Heatherton abandoned his post as visiting scholar at New York University in November, when an investigation was opened into his alleged sexual misconduct as a psychology professor at Dartmouth College. He is among three Dartmouth faculty members who were placed on paid leave in October pending the results of inquiries into the claims.
Norman Pattiz, a long-time member of the University of California Board of Regents, announced last week that he would resign in mid-February, following sustained pressure over revelations in 2016 that he allegedly sexually harassed an employee at his radio company. UC students have since been demanding he step down, and called out UC President Janet Napolitano for her repeated statements about being devoted to combatting sexual misconduct—even setting up a ""student advisory board"" on the issue—while allowing Pattiz to remain.
At the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, 37 faculty and staff have been accused of sexual assault or harassment since 2013, according to a new report by the student paper, Media Milwaukee. Violations were found in 11 of those cases and two investigations are still pending, though it is unclear what action were taken by the administration when misconduct was discovered.
In a statement to a local new outlet, the university would only say ""appropriate discipline was taken"" when misconduct was found. ""Most of the employees were terminated or had already left the university,"" added the university.	
Media Milwaukee notes that the Office of Equity and Diversity Services, responsible for overseeing harassment reporting and investigations, has been ""extremely understaffed for about 10 years,"" and seen frequent turnover, with four different interim directors since 2011.
A part-time chemistry professor at George Washington University has charged administrators subjected her to an ""malicious"" Title IX investigation into alleged sexual harassment of a student, and filed a lawsuit against the university and staff late last year.

http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama A&M University fired a tenured professor in March after the school discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on campus, according to court documents. The school severed ties with Edward Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama A&M. Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification. According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M campus, the school said. Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns. Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit. The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M police executed a search warrant, according to court documents. Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M informed Jones he would be fired. ""There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file. According to a memo from Alabama A&M police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012. Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer. In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M administration for ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation."" Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act. ""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,"" the lawsuit stated. In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross professional misconduct."" ""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative. ""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus.""

Matt Kucinski said the letter was sent Friday afternoon. In it, Shirley Hoogstra, Calvin's vice president for student life, said the student alleged in May this year she had carried out the relationship with biology professor Steve Matheson. ""Calvin has strict policies against sexual harassment and this relationship violated Calvin's policies,"" Hoogstra said in the letter. ""These policies recognize there is a power differential between faculty and students. After being confronted by the college with this report, the professor resigned rather than face termination."" The letter goes on to say Calvin administrators launched an ""extensive internal review and investigation,"" which led to the formation of a task force on the matter. The task force was set up to ""educate and protect our community so we can learn together how to prevent and properly address allegations of sexual harassment,"" according to Hoogstra's letter. The task force's formation delayed the news being brought before students because it only recently began meeting, Hoogstra said in the letter. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon so students could discuss the matter with Student Senate and school officials. FOX-17 first reported Friday's letter had been sent out.

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to seek out such material. ""My childhood and teen years put some context around what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday, July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City.  Merrill, 58, whose CMU research included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not excuse such conduct. “I never harmed a child, but I understand children were abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said. Before Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material. “I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those individuals,” Merrill said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that Merrill’s collection depicted  children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90 percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon violence toward children, Dill said. Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year felony. Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous Merrill apologized to them and to CMU. Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds, said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment. Merrill told Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn. “I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child pornography,"" he said. Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records. A member of the university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff alerted university police of the content. Questioned by police, Merrill said he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have any more such material. Police in November executed a search warrant at Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers. Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487 images of child porn and 26 similar videos. Merrill resigned from his tenured position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor weapons offense. Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case. A federal grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/09/investigation_found_professor.html,"Delta College.jpg Delta College ( ) BAY CITY, MI -- After two female students accused a professor of making inappropriate sexual advances toward them, Delta College's own investigation concluded it was likely the instructor indeed harassed them. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff on July 12 filed the lawsuit on behalf of Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski in Bay County Circuit Court. Named as defendants in the suit are Delta College and former Professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Mason and Jablonski are seeking damages in excess of $25,000, claiming they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they allege. Via a Freedom of Information Act request, The Times obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta College. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22 and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16. Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, the suit and the summary state. Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college. Fonville resigned from Delta Collegeo n Nov. 24, before Brown completed the investigation. Mason and Jablonski's suit asserts they are owed damages under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. The act prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status"" in employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations. In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denies any wrongdoing. The school denies ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Attorney Lenhoff, representing the plaintiffs, has said this response doesn't jibe with Brown's findings. ""This is inconsistent with the investigative report of Delta's Title IX coordinator,"" Lenhoff previously told The Times. ""Delta itself found the credibility of Emily and MaCayla to be high. It found Fonville's credibility was low. Delta found that there was sexual harassment here. I'm surprised at the answer and the answer's allegation is not so. ""Professors and teachers must understand affairs with students and sexual advances on students are just completely inappropriate,"" he continued. ""This case really touches on a major national issue."" Fonville is represented by attorney Anne McClorey McLaughlin of Farmington Hills-based Johnson, Rosati, Schultz & Joppich. ""My client denies that any communication he had with the plaintiffs had any impact on their studies at Delta College,"" McLaughlin said. ""It occurred outside of the time he was their instructor."" Fonville currently lives in Tennessee and was served with the suit there, Lenhoff said. The case is slated for a settlement conference before Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Tuesday, June 13, 2017. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2017/06/delta_college_settles_sexual_h.html,"BAY CITY, MI -- Two female students who alleged a Delta College professor sexually harassed them have dropped their lawsuit against the institution in exchange for a six-figure sum. On Feb. 7, Bay County Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran signed a stipulated order for dismissal in the suit filed by Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski against Delta College and former professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Sheeran dismissed the suit as it had been settled out of court. The settlement agreement, obtained by The Bay City Times-MLive via a Freedom of Information Act request, states Mason and Jablonski will receive $195,000 between them in exchange for releasing Delta and Fonville from all claims they have made against them. The sum is paid by the Michigan Community College Risk Management Authority, Delta's insurance provider. Despite settling, Delta and Fonville assert they are innocent of the plaintiffs' allegations. ""The College and Fonville do not admit, and in fact deny any liability or wrongdoing by entering into this Agreement and enter into this Agreement solely for economic business reasons and to buy their peace,"" the settlement states. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff filed the suit on the women's behalf in July 2016. In it, Jablonski and Mason claimed they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they alleged.

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/03/grcc_professor_resigns_after_s.html,"(MLive File Photo) GRAND RAPIDS, MI - A longtime Grand Rapids Community College professor, accused of repeatedly kissing a student against her will, resigned the same day he learned school officials would recommend his firing for sexual misconduct, according to documents released by the college. A GRCC investigation, prompted by a student complaint, determined humanities professor Harold Lee violated the school's sexual misconduct policies Lee had been on paid suspension since Dec. 18, 2015, pending the outcome of the investigation. The school later determined Lee had violated two policies, including sexual  assault - which includes non-consensual sexual touching - and those governing relationships with students or subordinates. Lee repeatedly kissed a student on the mouth after they met off-campus for a meal and drinks on Dec.11, according to information obtained from GRCC through a Freedom of Information Act request. Lee later admitted to school officials that their third and last kiss ""felt weird."" ""Lee admitted that he kissed (name redacted) three times over the course of several minutes. Lee admitted that he had no indication this behavior was welcome, and that nothing (redacted) ... did encouraged the kisses.,"" according to school documents. Lee faces no criminal charges from the unwanted kissing, authorities said. The kissing followed a meeting off-campus at a local bar in which Lee and the student had a meal and alcoholic drinks. Lee acknowledged that he drank three or four beers, but claims he would not have engaged in the behavior had he not been drinking. Prior to the three unwanted kisses, the student told the school she felt very uncomfortable at the bar because Lee was sharing ""disgusting details"" about his personal life, including about an addiction to pornography and affairs he'd engaged in previously, documents show. He made multiple calls that night to the student and his number was later blocked.
The student initially thought they were meeting for coffee to discuss another matter, but agreed to the meal after Lee said he was starving. Lee resigned Jan. 8, the same day he was notified that GRCC planned to bring charges against him to the Board of Trustees. The school planned to recommend his immediate termination at the Jan. 25 meeting. GRCC's sexual misconduct policy states, in part: GRCC also said that even if officials assumed Lee's relationship was consensual, his conduct was explicitly prohibited under the policy prohibiting consensual relationships. Lee's behavior ""was harassing, caused embarrassment, and was sexual,"" according to the Corrective Action Notice drawn up by the school. At one point, Lee had described the kiss as ""not sexual,"" but the student said it was sexual, adding ""he tried to use his tongue. I could feel it around my mouth."" The college newspaper, The Collegiate, first reported Lee's resignation. Lee has not been charged with any crime related to this case, police have said. GRCC reports this was not an isolated incident. In its Jan. 8 letter to Lee, they say he acknowledged prior incidents in which he engaged in inappropriate sexual activity related to his employment: • A sexual involvement while at Montcalm Community College, resulting in his resignation in lieu of termination. • Admission to a Kent County Sheriff's Department officer of an incident while in his faculty office at GRCC.

http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama A&M; University fired a tenured professor in March after the school
discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on
campus, according to court documents. The school severed ties with Edward
Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama A&M.; Most recently, he
worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification. According
to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M;, videos of Jones
were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex
acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All
three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M; campus, the school said. Jones
filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M; in February after the school began
termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of
harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and
concerns. Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond
the lawsuit. The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home
after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M; police executed a search warrant,
according to court documents. Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M;
informed Jones he would be fired. ""There is convincing evidence that you have
engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity
and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-
established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones'
March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file.
According to a memo from Alabama A&M; police investigator Brian Ruble, two of
the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012. Jones previously received
a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-
graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer. In the
lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M; administration for
ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and
Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said,
because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones'
previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal
grant management and implementation."" Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11
counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee
Whistleblower Act. ""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement
regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not
provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher
certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt
to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,""
the lawsuit stated. In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M; denied the
allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross
professional misconduct."" ""As is plainly evident by the university's filings,
the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this
professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the
professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the
university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the
university with no alternative. ""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this
former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus."" If you purchase a

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/12/calvin_college_letter_says_pro.html,"GRAND RAPIDS — Calvin College leaders sent a letter to students, parents,
faculty and staff Friday saying a professor resigned after a student claimed
she had a ""multi-year sexual relationship"" with him, a college spokesman
confirmed. Matt Kucinski said the letter was sent Friday afternoon. In it,
Shirley Hoogstra, Calvin's vice president for student life, said the student
alleged in May this year she had carried out the relationship with biology
professor Steve Matheson. ""Calvin has strict policies against sexual
harassment and this relationship violated Calvin's policies,"" Hoogstra said in
the letter. ""These policies recognize there is a power differential between
faculty and students. After being confronted by the college with this report,
the professor resigned rather than face termination."" The letter goes on to
say Calvin administrators launched an ""extensive internal review and
investigation,"" which led to the formation of a task force on the matter. The
task force was set up to ""educate and protect our community so we can learn
together how to prevent and properly address allegations of sexual
harassment,"" according to Hoogstra's letter. The task force's formation
delayed the news being brought before students because it only recently began
meeting, Hoogstra said in the letter. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday
afternoon so students could discuss the matter with Student Senate and school
officials. FOX-17 first reported Friday's letter had been sent out. Zane

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal
prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central
Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to
seek out such material. ""My childhood and teen years put some context around
what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday,
July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City. Merrill, 58, whose CMU research
included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not
excuse such conduct. “I never harmed a child, but I understand children were
abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said. Before
Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of
supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such
material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos
and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and
was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the
Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material.
“I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those
individuals,” Merrill said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that
Merrill’s collection depicted children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90
percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon
violence toward children, Dill said. Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one
count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory
minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said
that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged
in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU.
In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of
child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year
felony. Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult
children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous
Merrill apologized to them and to CMU. Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds,
said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife
talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him
and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment. Merrill told
Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn.
“I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know
I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child
pornography,"" he said. Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on
Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a
single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was
Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records. A member of the
university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and
discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff
alerted university police of the content. Questioned by police, Merrill said
he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography
was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill
went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have
any more such material. Police in November executed a search warrant at
Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers.
Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487
images of child porn and 26 similar videos. Merrill resigned from his tenured
position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and
launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day
after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court
on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive
activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of
using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor
weapons offense. Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one
count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors
dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case. A federal
grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012. If you purchase a product or

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/09/investigation_found_professor.html,"Delta College.jpg Delta College ( ) BAY CITY, MI -- After two female students
accused a professor of making inappropriate sexual advances toward them, Delta
College's own investigation concluded it was likely the instructor indeed
harassed them. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff on July 12 filed the lawsuit on
behalf of Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski in Bay County Circuit Court. Named
as defendants in the suit are Delta College and former Professor Jonathan
Brent Fonville. Mason and Jablonski are seeking damages in excess of $25,000,
claiming they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with
their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive
sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took
inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they allege. Via a Freedom of
Information Act request, The Times obtained a Title IX investigative summary
report from Delta College. The document states the investigation was conducted
by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's
complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22 and the investigation concluded
on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16. Title IX of Education
Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis
of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be
subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving
Federal financial assistance."" The summary report states the students began
following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015
semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related
material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the
interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began
telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting
on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, the
suit and the summary state. Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's
place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent
the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled
""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the
women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for
nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the
report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety
Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to
contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville.
The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville
""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant
within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because
the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his
actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and
conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared a similar sense of
humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis
You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant
felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she
did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director
Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via
Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr
messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report
continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed
high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report
states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's
credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by
stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville
violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no
additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by
the college. Fonville resigned from Delta Collegeo n Nov. 24, before Brown
completed the investigation. Mason and Jablonski's suit asserts they are owed
damages under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. The act
prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""religion, race, color, national
origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status"" in
employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations. In
Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A.
Rae-O'Donell, the college denies any wrongdoing. The school denies ""either
Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full
utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the
College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually
hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Attorney Lenhoff,
representing the plaintiffs, has said this response doesn't jibe with Brown's
findings. ""This is inconsistent with the investigative report of Delta's Title
IX coordinator,"" Lenhoff previously told The Times. ""Delta itself found the
credibility of Emily and MaCayla to be high. It found Fonville's credibility
was low. Delta found that there was sexual harassment here. I'm surprised at
the answer and the answer's allegation is not so. ""Professors and teachers
must understand affairs with students and sexual advances on students are just
completely inappropriate,"" he continued. ""This case really touches on a major
national issue."" Fonville is represented by attorney Anne McClorey McLaughlin
of Farmington Hills-based Johnson, Rosati, Schultz & Joppich. ""My client
denies that any communication he had with the plaintiffs had any impact on
their studies at Delta College,"" McLaughlin said. ""It occurred outside of the
time he was their instructor."" Fonville currently lives in Tennessee and was
served with the suit there, Lenhoff said. The case is slated for a settlement
conference before Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Tuesday, June 13, 2017.

http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama A&M University fired a tenured professor in March after the school discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on campus, according to court documents. The school severed ties with Edward Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama A&M. Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification. According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M campus, the school said. Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns. Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit. The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M police executed a search warrant, according to court documents. Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M informed Jones he would be fired. ""There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file. According to a memo from Alabama A&M police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012. Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer. In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M administration for ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation."" Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act. ""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,"" the lawsuit stated. In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross professional misconduct."" ""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative. ""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus.""

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/12/calvin_college_letter_says_pro.html,"GRAND RAPIDS — Calvin College leaders sent a letter to students, parents, faculty and staff Friday saying a professor resigned after a student claimed she had a ""multi-year sexual relationship"" with him, a college spokesman confirmed. Matt Kucinski said the letter was sent Friday afternoon. In it, Shirley Hoogstra, Calvin's vice president for student life, said the student alleged in May this year she had carried out the relationship with biology professor Steve Matheson. ""Calvin has strict policies against sexual harassment and this relationship violated Calvin's policies,"" Hoogstra said in the letter. ""These policies recognize there is a power differential between faculty and students. After being confronted by the college with this report, the professor resigned rather than face termination."" The letter goes on to say Calvin administrators launched an ""extensive internal review and investigation,"" which led to the formation of a task force on the matter. The task force was set up to ""educate and protect our community so we can learn together how to prevent and properly address allegations of sexual harassment,"" according to Hoogstra's letter. The task force's formation delayed the news being brought before students because it only recently began meeting, Hoogstra said in the letter. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon so students could discuss the matter with Student Senate and school officials. FOX-17 first reported Friday's letter had been sent out.

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to seek out such material. ""My childhood and teen years put some context around what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday, July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City.  Merrill, 58, whose CMU research included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not excuse such conduct. “I never harmed a child, but I understand children were abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said. Before Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material. “I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those individuals,” Merrill said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that Merrill’s collection depicted  children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90 percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon violence toward children, Dill said. Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year felony. Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous Merrill apologized to them and to CMU. Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds, said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment. Merrill told Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn. “I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child pornography,"" he said. Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records. A member of the university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff alerted university police of the content. Questioned by police, Merrill said he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have any more such material. Police in November executed a search warrant at Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers. Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487 images of child porn and 26 similar videos. Merrill resigned from his tenured position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor weapons offense. Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case. A federal grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/09/investigation_found_professor.html,"Delta College.jpg Delta College ( ) BAY CITY, MI -- After two female students accused a professor of making inappropriate sexual advances toward them, Delta College's own investigation concluded it was likely the instructor indeed harassed them. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff on July 12 filed the lawsuit on behalf of Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski in Bay County Circuit Court. Named as defendants in the suit are Delta College and former Professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Mason and Jablonski are seeking damages in excess of $25,000, claiming they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they allege. Via a Freedom of Information Act request, The Times obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta College. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22 and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16. Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, the suit and the summary state. Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college. Fonville resigned from Delta Collegeo n Nov. 24, before Brown completed the investigation. Mason and Jablonski's suit asserts they are owed damages under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. The act prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status"" in employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations. In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denies any wrongdoing. The school denies ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Attorney Lenhoff, representing the plaintiffs, has said this response doesn't jibe with Brown's findings. ""This is inconsistent with the investigative report of Delta's Title IX coordinator,"" Lenhoff previously told The Times. ""Delta itself found the credibility of Emily and MaCayla to be high. It found Fonville's credibility was low. Delta found that there was sexual harassment here. I'm surprised at the answer and the answer's allegation is not so. ""Professors and teachers must understand affairs with students and sexual advances on students are just completely inappropriate,"" he continued. ""This case really touches on a major national issue."" Fonville is represented by attorney Anne McClorey McLaughlin of Farmington Hills-based Johnson, Rosati, Schultz & Joppich. ""My client denies that any communication he had with the plaintiffs had any impact on their studies at Delta College,"" McLaughlin said. ""It occurred outside of the time he was their instructor."" Fonville currently lives in Tennessee and was served with the suit there, Lenhoff said. The case is slated for a settlement conference before Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Tuesday, June 13, 2017. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2017/06/delta_college_settles_sexual_h.html,"BAY CITY, MI -- Two female students who alleged a Delta College professor sexually harassed them have dropped their lawsuit against the institution in exchange for a six-figure sum. On Feb. 7, Bay County Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran signed a stipulated order for dismissal in the suit filed by Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski against Delta College and former professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Sheeran dismissed the suit as it had been settled out of court. The settlement agreement, obtained by The Bay City Times-MLive via a Freedom of Information Act request, states Mason and Jablonski will receive $195,000 between them in exchange for releasing Delta and Fonville from all claims they have made against them. The sum is paid by the Michigan Community College Risk Management Authority, Delta's insurance provider. Despite settling, Delta and Fonville assert they are innocent of the plaintiffs' allegations. ""The College and Fonville do not admit, and in fact deny any liability or wrongdoing by entering into this Agreement and enter into this Agreement solely for economic business reasons and to buy their peace,"" the settlement states. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff filed the suit on the women's behalf in July 2016. In it, Jablonski and Mason claimed they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they alleged. Via another Freedom of Information Act request, MLive obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta.

The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college. Fonville resigned from Delta College on Nov. 24, 2015, before Brown completed the investigation. In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denied any wrongdoing. The school denied ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Fonville had relocated to Tennessee and was living there when the suit was filed. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/03/grcc_professor_resigns_after_s.html,"(MLive File Photo) GRAND RAPIDS, MI - A longtime Grand Rapids Community College professor, accused of repeatedly kissing a student against her will, resigned the same day he learned school officials would recommend his firing for sexual misconduct, according to documents released by the college. A GRCC investigation, prompted by a student complaint, determined humanities professor Harold Lee violated the school's sexual misconduct policies Lee had been on paid suspension since Dec. 18, 2015, pending the outcome of the investigation. The school later determined Lee had violated two policies, including sexual  assault - which includes non-consensual sexual touching - and those governing relationships with students or subordinates. Lee repeatedly kissed a student on the mouth after they met off-campus for a meal and drinks on Dec.11, according to information obtained from GRCC through a Freedom of Information Act request. Lee later admitted to school officials that their third and last kiss ""felt weird."" ""Lee admitted that he kissed (name redacted) three times over the course of several minutes. Lee admitted that he had no indication this behavior was welcome, and that nothing (redacted) ... did encouraged the kisses.,"" according to school documents. Lee faces no criminal charges from the unwanted kissing, authorities said. The kissing followed a meeting off-campus at a local bar in which Lee and the student had a meal and alcoholic drinks. Lee acknowledged that he drank three or four beers, but claims he would not have engaged in the behavior had he not been drinking. Prior to the three unwanted kisses, the student told the school she felt very uncomfortable at the bar because Lee was sharing ""disgusting details"" about his personal life, including about an addiction to pornography and affairs he'd engaged in previously, documents show. He made multiple calls that night to the student and his number was later blocked.
The student initially thought they were meeting for coffee to discuss another matter, but agreed to the meal after Lee said he was starving. Lee resigned Jan. 8, the same day he was notified that GRCC planned to bring charges against him to the Board of Trustees. The school planned to recommend his immediate termination at the Jan. 25 meeting. GRCC's sexual misconduct policy states, in part: GRCC also said that even if officials assumed Lee's relationship was consensual, his conduct was explicitly prohibited under the policy prohibiting consensual relationships. Lee's behavior ""was harassing, caused embarrassment, and was sexual,"" according to the Corrective Action Notice drawn up by the school. At one point, Lee had described the kiss as ""not sexual,"" but the student said it was sexual, adding ""he tried to use his tongue. I could feel it around my mouth."" The college newspaper, The Collegiate, first reported Lee's resignation. Lee has not been charged with any crime related to this case, police have said. GRCC reports this was not an isolated incident. In its Jan. 8 letter to Lee, they say he acknowledged prior incidents in which he engaged in inappropriate sexual activity related to his employment: • A sexual involvement while at Montcalm Community College, resulting in his resignation in lieu of termination. • Admission to a Kent County Sheriff's Department officer of an incident while in his faculty office at GRCC.

http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2017/12/osu_professor_fired_for_sexual_harassment_bullying_makes_rare_appeal_to_trustees.html,"A veteran Oregon State University professor fired over allegations of sexual harassment and bullying has appealed his dismissal to the school's board of trustees, according to board documents. Oregon State trustees on Dec. 11 will determine the fate of A. Morrie Craig, a toxicology professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine. He was first hired by the university in 1976. Craig's attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The appeal is a rare example of a faculty member fighting for his or her employment by seeking intervention from a school's independent governing board. The university board formed in 2014 following the dissolution of the State Board of Higher Education. ""Usually, matters such as these are settled by a university and the faculty member,"" said Steve Clark, a university spokesman. He said he was not aware of any appeal made to the now-defunct higher education board. Clark declined to provide any specifics surrounding the alleged harassment that led to Craig's termination. ""The university does take complaints of bullying and sexual harassment very seriously,"" he said. Craig is still working at the Corvallis campus pending the outcome of Monday's board meeting. According to university documents shared with the board of trustees, Craig on May 16 was accused of ""engaging in bullying and sexual harassment,"" a violation of school policies punishable by dismissal. Oregon State defines bullying as ""conduct of any sort directed at another that is severe, pervasive, or persistent."" The behavior must be something that would cause someone in the victim's shoes ""substantial emotional distress and undermine his or her ability to work, study or participate in his or her regular life activities."" A special committee of the school's Faculty Senate held a two-day hearing and heard testimony from 18 witnesses. Craig also testified on his own behalf at the hearing, according to the documents. The faculty committee recommended firing Craig on Oct. 23, and Ray sent the letter a week later. University President Ed Ray sent Craig a letter terminating his employment on Oct. 30. Craig petitioned the Benton County Circuit Court on Nov. 6 to review the decision. But Judge Matthew Donohue wrote back the same day to say the court had no jurisdiction. The court documents, which included emails sent by concerned faculty and students, shed some light on the case. One veterinary student wrote to veterinary school dean Dr. Susan Tornquist in May to say she was ""sickened"" by his instruction and demeanor in the classroom. Denise Apperson, the student, listed her concerns: ""The outright falsehoods, the misinterpretation of fundamental science, the misstatements of fact, the manufactured dramatics, all overlain with an overt creepiness."" ""I hope that you understand where my strong words are coming from. I hope that there is a resolution to this."" Apperson, in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, said she could not comment on the case. On Monday, the university's trustees will have a chance to review and discuss the case. The board's 13 members are a mix of prominent business leaders, alumni and educators who are appointed by the governor. Clark said the trustees could vote to: support the university's decision to fire Craig with cause; return the case to the school for additional testimony and review; create a committee of the trustees' board to investigate the issue; or opt for an independent hearings officer to determine Craig's fate. Clark said it's unclear who would make the next move, the Faculty Senate or the school administration, if the board sends the issue back to Oregon State. Monday's meeting is by teleconference, and the public won't be able to call in or stream the meeting online, Clark said. An in-person listening station is available in Room 208 of the Memorial Union. Dr. Linda Blythe, a retired Oregon State veterinary professor who worked closely with Craig for decades, said she did not witness him bully or sexually harass students or researchers. She described the allegations against him as a ""sad end"" to a research career that brought millions of dollars in grants and funding to Oregon State. ""We have had a large number of graduate students come through that lab, and never one complaint in 40 years,"" Blythe said, referring to the decades prior to the university's investigation. Craig's ties to Oregon State are deep. He spent his entire career at the university after earning his doctorate there in 1970. He was granted tenure in 1982 and was recently paid $147,252, according to university records. His parents were also alumni, according to his mother's obituary. Craig founded a lab that tests for toxins in grass and other types of feed, Blythe said. The toxins pose a lethal threat to animals. Detecting them is crucial to farmers in Benton and Linn counties, the hub of Oregon's grass seed industry. The lab also tests for toxins in a variety of samples sent by veterinarians from all over the world, Blythe said. -- Andrew Theen and Molly Young Lynne Palombo of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Karl Kjer, 57, was ordered to have no contact with the teenager he allegedly videotaped with a hidden camera in June 2015, the prosecutor's office said. He must also undergo a mental health evaluation and treatment. Kjer, who now lives in Jersey City, was charged with invasion of privacy in February after the teenager was identified.

http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2017/06/conviction_overturned_for_professor_accused_of_sex.html,"NEWARK - Former Rutgers-Newark professor Anna Stubblefield, who was accused of sexually assaulting a disabled man who was unable to speak, has had her convictions overturned after an appellate court determined she did not get a fair trial. The court ordered that Stubblefield get another trial overseen by a new judge. The decision was handed down Friday, overturning Stubblefield's two 2015 convictions for first-degree aggravated sexual assault. During the trial, the jury concluded that Stubblefield, then a 39-years-old philosophy professor, had sexually assaulted a then-29-year-old man known only as D.J. in 2011. The man had cerebral palsy and was unable to speak apart from making noises. Psychologists determined that D.J. couldn't consent to sex because he was mentally impaired. During the trial, Stubblefield's lawyers maintained that she and D.J. fell in love and that she was able to communicate with him through a typing method called ""facilitated communication."" Following the conviction, Stubblefield was sentenced to two consecutive 12-year terms in prison and lifetime parole supervision. Much of Stubblefield's case focused on the accuracy and reliability of the controversial typing method, ""facilitated communication,"" which the appellate court referred to as ""FC,"" in its decision. Before the trial, Superior Court Judge Siobhan Teare, who presided over the case, ruled that there could be no expert testimony on the reliability or technique of FC because it wasn't a ""recognized science."" Over the course of Stubblefield's 2015 trial, Essex County prosecutors presented three experts who all testified to D.J.'s mental incapacities. One expert, Dr. Howard Shane, who has a PhD in speech pathologies, testified that the man was not a candidate for augmentative communication devices because of his impaired mental state, the decision said. But Stubblefield's defense attorney had an expert witness too - Dr. Rosemary Crossley, an augmentative and alternative communication specialist from Austrialia who determined that D.J. could communicate and read, according to the decision. Crossley did an extensive, three-day videoed evaluation of D.J., which sought to determine his language and literacy skills and determine if he had, ""communicative intent,"" the decision said. She did use FC in her assessment but nothing that she used the device for factored into her overall assessment of D.J., the defense argued. However, her evaluation and videotape of the assessment were not brought into evidence  - they were deemed unreliable because she had used FC in her assessment, the court ruled. ""The court believed Dr. Crossley's reports and examinations are inadmissible because her communication assessment is based upon an unrecognized field of science known as facilitated communication, rendering Dr. Crossley not an expert and her opinion inadmissible as a net opinion,"" the decision said in an overview of the facts of the case. In the decision, the appellate court sided with Stubblefield's defense attorneys, who claimed that by preventing Crossley from presenting her full evaluation of D.J., the court was preventing the defense attorneys from presenting their full argument. ""The jury and not the court should have ultimately determined whether Dr. Crossley's evaluation was persuasive, and whether the state proved defendant knew or should have known that D.J. could not consent,"" the appellate court ruled. Because they couldn't hear Crossley's full assessment, the jury was left with the impression that no expert or other person - apart from Stubblefield herself - believed that D.J. had the mental abilities to consent to sex, the decision said. ""Unfortunately, the court, in its attempt to cleanse the record of controversial FC methodology, limited the evidence to the extent that defendant was not given a fair opportunity to present her defense,"" the appellate court ruled. The court went on to call the facts of the case ""extraordinary,"" and that they called for ""a liberal admission of evidence supporting defendant's defense."" The appellate court called for a new judge who would allow Crossley to testify regarding her evaluation and who would admit at least parts of her video evaluation into evidence for the jury to view. Stubblefield's case became a national story after her 2011 charges but the interactions date back almost ten years. She first met D.J. through his brother, who was a student in her class, in 2008. Stubblefield, then a department chair at Rutgers University, showed a film to her class regarding FC. The film prompted D.J.'s brother to approach his professor and ask for help for his brother. D.J. could not speak words, wore a diaper and needed help in day-to-day living, according to statement of facts in the decision. The professor began to have meetings with D.J. in 2009 - at first with his parents and then alone in her office. ""(Stubblefield) became convinced that D.J. had been misdiagnosed as having the intellectual ability of a young child,"" the decision said. In May 2011, Stubblefield told D.J.'s parents that she had sexual contact with their son and that they were in love, according to the decision. She then kissed D.J. in front of his parents. D.J.'s parents questioned whether he was capable of consent and tested him with questions only he would know, according to the decision. When they believed he answered the questions incorrectly, they told Stubblefield to stop having contact with their son and called Rutgers University with a complaint. The university reached out to the Essex County Prosecutor's Office who, after an investigation, charged and indicted Stubblefield on two counts of aggravated sexual assault. Stubblefield has never denied having sexual contact with D.J. but she has argued that he was mentally competent enough to consent to their interactions.

David Lassman / The Post-Standard (David Lassman | dlassman@syracuse.com) SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Syracuse University has dismissed a male professor who had a consensual relationship with a female undergraduate student. The faculty member, who SU has not identified, taught, advised and supervised the student during the relationship. It is the first time in decades a tenured professor at SU has been terminated through this process. The dismissal is effective today and was announced by Chancellor Kent Syverud in his weekly email to the campus community. Syverud first described the case and the proceedings against the tenured associate professor in May. The charges against the professor were first lodged last year. A hearing panel of three faculty members deliberated and found that the associate professor violated the consensual relationships provision of the policy on inappropriate conduct by faculty members and the University Code of Ethical Conduct. The panel recommended the professor be dismissed and that his tenure be revoked. Syverud accepted the finding and recommendation, he said. The average salary for an associate SU professor in 2012-2013 was $87,700. The faculty member asked the board of trustees to review the case. Last week after hearing verbal arguments from the professor and the university, trustees upheld the hearing panel's findings.

http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2013/10/case_law_professor_sues_dean_l.html,"IMG_4000_15285373.JPG Case Law School Dean Lawrence Mitchell (Case Western Reserve University) CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Case
Western Reserve Law Professor Raymond Ku filed a lawsuit today against Law
School Dean Lawrence Mitchell and the university alleging that he reported that
Mitchell had potentially sexually harassed a woman and suffered retaliation. Ku,
a former associate dean at the law school, reported in 2011 potential
instances of Mitchell harassing law school faculty and staff, according to the
civil law suit filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. (See the full complaint in the document viewer below.) University officials responded to the lawsuit this afternoon with the following statement: ""This situation is categorically not an instance of retaliation. Professor Ku continues to hold a full-time, tenured faculty position at the School of Law. The lawsuit itself includes inaccuracies, as well as an inflammatory flier that has been found to be materially false. The university will have additional comment upon more thorough review of the suit and opposing counsel's press release."" In the suit, Ku alleges that he made reports to the university's provost, vice president for
diversity and faculty diversity officer. Ku
said he personally witnessed Mitchell caressing a female staff member at a
party and was made aware of allegations by other women at the university that
Mitchell had made inappropriate comments to others. The
issue of Mitchell's sexual conduct also came up at a January 2012 City Club
event, according to the suit, when flyers were passed out with questions about Mitchell's
alleged relationships with female students,  and an alleged comment to staff that one graduate
student ""wasn't good for anything but keeping the bed warm."" According
to the suit, Mitchell threatened to fire Ku – a tenured professor since 2003 –
and stripped him of many duties as an associate dean and later his
co-directorship of the Center for Law, Technology & the Arts. He also
reduced his pay, according to the suit. Mitchell could not be reached by phone or email for comment Wednesday. The
suit also alleges that the university was aware of prior concerns about
potential sexual misconduct by Mitchell during his time at George Washington
University, including a reported relationship with a law student. He was hired
by Case in 2011 after an extended search for a new law school dean. The
suit details various people in positions of leadership at Case that Ku and his
attorneys say he reported the concerns to, including a formal complaint he
filed. Another
staff member who reported to Provost W.A. Baeslack that Mitchell was having a
sexual relationship with a Case law student was reassigned and later laid off,
according to the suit. Attorney
Subodh Chandra, whose firm is representing Ku, said Mitchell continued to retaliate
against Professor Ku, even after the university's Chief Litigation counsel met
with law school faculty and staff, warning them to follow the university's
sexual harassment reporting policy. ""Professor Ku paid a high price for doing what
was both required and right—standing up for victims at great personal risk and
reporting to
senior university officials Dean Mitchell's potential harassment,"" Chandra
said. ""But retaliation is illegal and a law-school dean should know he is not
above the law."" Chandra
questioned now whether Case would continue to back Mitchell.  "" The only
question now is whether Case will continue to back Mitchell or ""live up to its
own policies and ideals for the sake of its students, staff, and faculty."" Case spokesman William Lubinger also provided a statement from B. Jessie Hill, Case Law's Associate Dean for Faculty Development and Research. ""Dean Mitchell has worked to increase diversity and equity since he arrived at our law school,"" said the emailed statement. ""He has addressed historical pay disparities between male and female faculty, launched a dynamic Women's Law and Leadership Initiative, and increased the proportion of women and underrepresented minorities within our recent entering classes."" Hill was not available for an interview but her statement said she had not experienced or observed inappropriate behavior from Mitchell. Ku's suit says that no women have joined Case's Law School faculty since Mitchell took over and several women have left from both faculty and staff positions. He also alleged that Mitchell made comments about Ku's Chinese heritage and conversion to Judaism.

http://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/02/former_30-year_employee_sues_p.html,"Penn State Old Main Penn State's Old Main ( File photo) WILLIAMSPORT -- A former Penn State employee has accused the university of gender discrimination, sexual harassment, hostile work environment and retaliation. Joane Stoneberg, who in her 30 years of employment rose from a part-time transcript clerk to programs coordinator in the College of Arts and Architecture, made the claims in a civil rights suit filed Monday in U.S. Middle District Court. Stoneberg, who now lives in Reisterstown, Maryland, says she took early retirement in October 2014 because her supervisors failed to act on her complaints. The suit accuses Curt Marshall, coordinator of multicultural programs in the college, with ""infecting"" her workplace with sexually offensive comments and conduct. The complaint says that beginning in November 2006, when they shared an office suite, Marshall made offensive and inappropriate sexual comments, forwarded her sexually inappropriate emails, propositioned her, commented on her looks and shared intimate details about his marital sex life. When she advised Gary Kesler, then associate dean of the arts college, of her intention to pursue a sexual harassment complaint against Marshall, she claims she was urged not to but to let him handle it informally. Shortly after that discussion, Marshall apologized, but Stoneberg says she spent the next five years avoiding him. She claims he resumed his offensive behavior in March 2014, including hugging her twice in front of co-workers when Kessler was off work due to illness. When Stoneberg made a sexual harassment complaint against Marshall to Yvonne Guadelius, associate vice president and senior associate dean of undergraduate education, she was told to call a new sexual harassment hotline, the suit states. Because the hot line was for students, not staff,  she lodged her complaint with Kenneth Lehman III, vice provost for affirmative action. At an April 14, 2014, meeting with him, Stoneberg said she was told Marshall would be required to take a sexual harassment class and they would not share office space, the suit states. Marshall never moved, so Stoneberg claims she was forced to temporarily move to another building. When she notified her supervisor she was considering leaving the university, the suit states, a new position was created for her but it stripped her of her high-level responsibilities. She claims that being forced to take the entry-level position providing academic advising to undergraduates and doing new student orientation in the summer was humiliating, embarrassing and demeaning. As program coordinator, Stoneberg said, she chaired and co-chaired committees, participated in high-level admissions decisions, ran the new student orientation and organized academic advising. The suit accuses Lehman of not forcing Marshall to move from the shared office, not interviewing Stoneberg as part of any investigation and failing to respond in any way to her complaint. Forcing her to change jobs was retaliation for her pursuing her sexual harassment complaint, she charges. Were it not for the retaliation, Stoneberg said, she would have remained at the university until July 1, 2015, her original planned retirement date. She is seeking unspecified damages and the compensation she would have received had she remained until her planned retirement date. The filing of the complaint followed her receipt in January of a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Penn State does not comment on pending litigation, spokeswoman Lisa M. Powers said Tuesday.

https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2018/12/una-professor-accused-of-sexual-harassment-terminated.html,"University of North Alabama professor Greg Gaston was found in violation of Title IX for sexual harassment and was subsequently fired. At least three women contacted UNA’s Title IX office to report Gaston for inappropriate behavior. Gaston was placed on a no trespass order on June 22, 2018, dependent on the results of the Title IX investigation, that barred him from UNA’s campus and university-sponsored events. Payton Gilchrist was the first to file a complaint against Gaston in June 2018. Gilchrist said Gaston was known for making inappropriate comments during class, but crossed a line when he asked her to take a vacation with him. Gilchrist declined, but Gaston continued to pursue a romantic relationship with her. “[Gaston] would make sexist comments in class, he would show favoritism toward females. There were a lot of behaviors of Dr. Gaston that was inappropriate that people would brush off,” Gilchirst said in an interview with AL.com. When UNA’s student newspaper, the FlorAla, published that Gaston was given a no trespass order, more women came forward to UNA’s Title IX office with accusations of sexual harassment against Gaston. Amanda Gallagher, who graduated from UNA in 2013, was one of them. “Immediately I knew what [the no trespass order] had been about because of my and my friends experiences,” Gallagher said. Gallagher said Gaston had commented on the size of her breasts and touched her inappropriately when she was a student at UNA. “I was standing in the hallway of the geology department talking to a friend and he walked by and he rubbed his hand across my ass,”Gallagher said. “I stopped talking and he looked at me and he said he was feeling for a panty line.” The Title IX investigation took six months, in part, Gilchrist said, because of the women who continued to come forward. In a letter to Gaston on Dec. 17, Tammy Jacques, Title IX Coordinator wrote “Given the documentation and witness interviews obtained during this investigation, you have been found responsible for violating the Sexual Misconduct policy (specifically Sexual Harassment) and UNA’s Policy on Consensual Relationships. The Title IX office is recommending that your employment be terminated for cause and compliance with Section 2.6.2 of the Faculty Handbook.” That same day, UNA Vice President for academic affairs Ross Alexander sent a letter of termination to Gaston. “I feel incredibly proud of Payton for having the bravery to come forward,” Gallagher said. “It’s not an easy thing, and I think the backlash, the response to the investigation, shows there’s still an uphill battle for women to report sexual indecency, especially for men in positions of power.” Gaston did not respond to requests for comment.

https://www.nj.com/middlesex/2019/02/ex-rutgers-med-school-doctor-accused-of-recording-women-in-bathroom-identity-theft-gun-charge-in-160-count-indictment.html,"A former Rutgers medical school professor and director at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey has been accused of recording at least 26 women and three other people in various states of undress in a bathroom and breaking into his colleague’s offices to commit identity theft, among other charges in a sweeping 160-count indictment of alleged illegal activity over a two year span. Dr. James Goydos, 58, a then-professor of surgery Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, was initially arrested in March 2018 and charged with having an unregistered and unlicensed assault rifle after police searched his East Brunswick home. At the time, Goydos was put on leave from Rutgers, where he specialized in melanoma treatment, and authorities declined to say what prompted the search. The indictment against Goydos issued in December, however, revealed a wide range of charges involving accusations at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey offices in New Brunswick and elsewhere in Middlesex County dating to April 2016. The charges include: invasion of privacy (more than 100 counts), official misconduct, burglary, computer theft, impersonation, wiretapping, falsely implicating another, coercion, hindering, possession of an assault rifle and possession of a prohibited device. He is next due in court in March. Goydos is no longer employed at Rutgers, Peter McDonough Jr., a Rutgers spokesman, confirmed in an email this week. McDonough said that none of the allegations were related to patient care. Goydos earned a $437,500 while working at Rutgers, according to public records. A message left at Goydos’s East Brunswick home was not returned and an attempt to reach him on social media was unsuccessful. His attorney did not return a message. According to the 41-page indictment, Goydos entered offices of four people in the Cancer Institute of New Jersey during 2016 and stole information from their computers in a “scheme to defraud, or to obtain services, property, personal identifying information or money.” He then impersonated the employees to get “benefit for himself or another, or to injure or defraud another,” according to the indictment. Additional official misconduct charges have been brought against him for using his status as a Rutgers employee to access the computers and information. In 2017, Goydos is accused of filming or photographing, without their consent, 26 women and three others whose genders were not identified, obtaining images of them in various stages of undress, according to the indictment. Andrea Boulton, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office, said the victims were not photographed or filmed in Goydos’s capacity as a physician, but in a bathroom at his workplace. McDonough said the university immediately contacted the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office after learning of Goydos’s activities. Goydos was indicted after a joint investigation from the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office and the Rutgers University Police Department, according to the prosecutor’s office. His LinkedIn profile lists his job as the director of the Melanoma and Soft Tissue Oncology Program at RWJ, and indicates he started working at Rutgers in 1995. He also studied medicine at RWJ during the 1980s. Amanda Hoover can be reached at ahoover@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @amandahoovernj. Find NJ.com on Facebook.

https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/04/university-of-michigan-opera-professor-harassed-student-remains-on-payroll.html,"ANN ARBOR, MI -- The University of Michigan last month determined that tenured professor David Daniels, a world-famous opera singer, sexually harassed at least one student in March 2017, according to an email obtained by The Ann Arbor News/MLive. The university’s Office of Institutional Equity sent the email to a student on March 27, substantiating findings that Daniels violated policy when he offered to pay the student $300 for sex using the Grindr hookup phone application in March 2017. The Ann Arbor News/MLive obtained the email from the student, a 23-year-old senior majoring in voice and economics. A UM spokesman declined comment, citing its policy not to discuss sexual misconduct investigations. Based on police reports and interviews with the student, who The Ann Arbor News/MLive has agreed not to name, the student provided UM police screen shots of the inappropriate online chat in July, although the OIE didn’t contact him until November or complete its investigation until eight months later. The student called the investigation a “no-brainer” that “should not take that long.” “Professor Daniels disagrees with the findings and looks forward to the time when all of the facts of this matter are made known,"" said attorney Fran Stacy, who represents Daniels. “We would caution against drawing any conclusions at this time.” Daniels has been at the center of controversy since last August when he and his husband, William Scott Walters, were accused of raping a man in Houston in 2010. He was also named in a civil lawsuit in which Daniels is accused of tricking another student into take a sleeping pill before molesting him. Daniels remains on the UM payroll, earning a salary of more than $191,000 per year, according to online salary records, but hasn’t taught in at least seven months. In response to mounting allegations of sexual impropriety, UM placed Daniels on paid leave and ordered him to stay off campus in August. The university first received anonymous complaints alleging Daniels propositioned two students over Grindr on March 29, 2018. The OIE, tasked with investigating sexual misconduct claims made against professors, closed its original investigation after investigators were unable to contact any victims. Daniels, who denied the allegations, was, however, reminded of UM’s sexual harassment, dating and social media use policies. Weeks later, the UM Board of Regents voted unanimously to grant Daniels’ tenure. Elected members of the Board of Regents have not responded to requests from the Ann Arbor News/MLive for comment.  University representatives, including the Board of Regents, have also refused to comment on the Daniels investigations, and have declined multiple public records requests submitted by The Ann Arbor News/MLive. Subsequently, it is unclear when the original investigation was officially closed, if there are any pending misconduct investigations or whether the Board of Regents was made aware of claims prior to granting Daniels tenure. The Grindr claims re-emerged in July after the Board of Regents and other UM officials received an anonymous email alleging Daniels and Walters “drugged and raped a young singer"" following a performance Daniels starred in at the Houston Grand Opera in 2010. While Walters and Daniels told UM police they had a sexual encounter with the the singer, later revealed to be Samuel Schultz, after providing him the prescription drug Ambien, they maintain the sex was consensual and that they stopped when Schultz appeared to be inebriated. The UM sexual assault investigation was forwarded to Houston police. The Harris County, Texas Prosecutor’s Office in January charged Daniels and Walters each with a count of second-degree sexual assault. Daniels and Walters were arrested and later freed on bond. They’re scheduled to appear in a Houston Courtroom on June 10 for a pretrial conference. During that investigation, UM Deputy Police Chief Melissa Overton said detectives learned of five claims involving current or former students alleging they were solicited by Daniels using Grindr. Messages between Daniels and one student indicate Daniels knew the student and realized he was being inappropriate. At one point in the online conversation, after realizing he was communicating with a professor in the school where he attended class, the student typed, “this is not OK.” Daniels apologized for “drunkenly” crossing the line and asked the student to keep their communication secret, especially since he was “one year from tenure.” The student told The Ann Arbor News/MLive he didn’t report the incident but did tell a friend and his parents about it and agreed to be interviewed by UM police when detectives contacted him in July 2018. Andrew Lipian, a graduate student, filed a civil lawsuit against Daniels and UM in federal court in October, alleging Daniels sexually assaulted him in March 2017. Lipian’s lawsuit says he was invited to Daniels’ apartment to watch “Ru Paul’s Drag Race,” because Daniels was “lonely” and wanted to discuss Lipian’s singing career. After serving Lipian several pours of bourbon, the lawsuit claimed Lipian told Daniels he was tired and needed sleep for a performance the next day. The lawsuit alleges Daniels handed Lipian what he said was a Tylenol PM, but was actually the sleep medication Ambien. Daniels then removed Lipian’s clothes, forced himself upon Lipian and groped and touched his genitals and face, according to the lawsuit. Daniels called Lipian’s claims “fake and malicious"" in a December counterclaim alleging an invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress. Daniels, in court filings said Lipian, a friend since 2012, “behaved in a sexually suggestive or romantic manner” toward Daniels, and “especially"" Walters. The lawsuit against Daniels, as well as Daniels’ counterclaims against Lipian, were dismissed by U.S. District Judge Arthur A. Tarnow on Thursday, Feb. 21. “The federal claims were dismissed against my client because they were improperly brought,” said Francyne Stacey, the attorney defending Daniels in the civil lawsuit “If Mr. Lipian refiles in state court, he will face the same counterclaims.” The portion of the lawsuit filed against UM remains in federal court and more broadly accuses the university of being “deliberately indifferent” to various allegations made against Daniels, because of his value and status as a “renowned singer.” The university said it appropriately investigated and responded to the misconduct investigations involving Daniels. The student Daniels propositioned, however, criticized what he calls “radio silence” from administrators since allegations came to light and feels the OIE reacted too slowly. “I get a certain amount of discretion, contractually, legally, but the speed of it is the main thing,” he said. ""If the investigation took two months, which is what I’d consider a reasonable time to investigate this, it could have been done with last semester.  ""Instead he continues to be on the payroll ... "" While the university has options should it decide to fire, demote or sanction Daniels for the policy violation finding, the process is complicated by his tenure. The university declined to comment on whether it plans to seek disciplinary action. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/03/um-regents-vote-to-fire-david-daniels-tenured-opera-professor-accused-of-sexual-misconduct.html,"ANN ARBOR, MI — The University of Michigan Board of Regents Thursday unanimously voted to remove opera professor David Daniels from his tenured position, as well as deny eligibility for severance pay. UM President Mark Schlissel recommended Daniel’s firing, calling the renowned countertenor’s conduct “inconsistent with the character of tenure at the University of Michigan and therefore constitutes cause for dismissal.” A number of former students have accused of Daniels of sexual harassment and abuse. Regent Ron Weiser said it was the first time in 60 years that a faculty member’s tenure has been revoked. “At the heart of every decision of the board is the safety and well being of our students,” Weiser said. “... When the board sees this jeopardized by a tenured member of the faculty, we believe it’s necessary to take extreme action or dismissal.” A few public speakers opposed removing Daniels’ tenure, including two opera singers who said Daniels has helped many students further their opera careers, and called the recommendation to fire Daniels “ridiculous.” Daniels was placed on paid leave in August 2018 after several sexually charged claims, including accusations that he solicited students online for sex, drugged and raped a Rice University student with his husband, William A. Scott Walters, and assaulted another student who is suing the university. Daniels and Walters have denied the allegations. Daniels was awarded tenure less than two months after UM received an anonymous complaint alleging he used the dating app Grindr to offer a student money in exchange for sex. The regents unanimously approved tenure for Daniels in May 2018, based on multiple recommendations from students and faculty. UM professor tenured weeks after complaint of Grindr proposition Court documents filed last month showed faculty members at UM’s School of Music, Theatre and Dance expressed concern over the hiring of Daniels in 2015. One faculty member expressed a need to “tell him to keep his hands off” students. The process to terminate Daniels was started by School of Music, Dance and Theatre Dean David Gier in 2019. A hearing followed, resulting in Schlissel’s recommendation to fire the professor. Daniels’ attorney Francyne Stacey earlier this week called Schlissel’s recommendation a mistake, but said ""it’s not my decision to make.” UM is currently investigating sexual misconduct allegations against late athletic doctor Robert Anderson and provost Martin Philbert. Jason Mars, an assistant professor of computer science at UM, is also being investigated for inappropriate behavior and resigned as CEO of Clinc, an AI startup based in Ann Arbor. UM has not opened an investigation into Mars.

http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama A&M University fired a tenured professor in March after the school discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on campus, according to court documents. The school severed ties with Edward Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama A&M. Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification. According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M campus, the school said. Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns. Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit. The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M police executed a search warrant, according to court documents. Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M informed Jones he would be fired. ""There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file. According to a memo from Alabama A&M police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012. Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer. In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M administration for ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation."" Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act. ""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,"" the lawsuit stated. In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross professional misconduct."" ""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative. ""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus.""

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/12/calvin_college_letter_says_pro.html,"GRAND RAPIDS — Calvin College leaders sent a letter to students, parents, faculty and staff Friday saying a professor resigned after a student claimed she had a ""multi-year sexual relationship"" with him, a college spokesman confirmed. Matt Kucinski said the letter was sent Friday afternoon. In it, Shirley Hoogstra, Calvin's vice president for student life, said the student alleged in May this year she had carried out the relationship with biology professor Steve Matheson. ""Calvin has strict policies against sexual harassment and this relationship violated Calvin's policies,"" Hoogstra said in the letter. ""These policies recognize there is a power differential between faculty and students. After being confronted by the college with this report, the professor resigned rather than face termination."" The letter goes on to say Calvin administrators launched an ""extensive internal review and investigation,"" which led to the formation of a task force on the matter. The task force was set up to ""educate and protect our community so we can learn together how to prevent and properly address allegations of sexual harassment,"" according to Hoogstra's letter. The task force's formation delayed the news being brought before students because it only recently began meeting, Hoogstra said in the letter. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon so students could discuss the matter with Student Senate and school officials. FOX-17 first reported Friday's letter had been sent out.

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to seek out such material. ""My childhood and teen years put some context around what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday, July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City.  Merrill, 58, whose CMU research included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not excuse such conduct. “I never harmed a child, but I understand children were abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said. Before Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material. “I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those individuals,” Merrill said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that Merrill’s collection depicted  children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90 percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon violence toward children, Dill said. Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year felony. Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous Merrill apologized to them and to CMU. Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds, said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment. Merrill told Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn. “I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child pornography,"" he said. Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records. A member of the university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff alerted university police of the content. Questioned by police, Merrill said he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have any more such material. Police in November executed a search warrant at Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers. Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487 images of child porn and 26 similar videos. Merrill resigned from his tenured position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor weapons offense. Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case. A federal grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/09/investigation_found_professor.html,"Delta College.jpg Delta College ( ) BAY CITY, MI -- After two female students accused a professor of making inappropriate sexual advances toward them, Delta College's own investigation concluded it was likely the instructor indeed harassed them. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff on July 12 filed the lawsuit on behalf of Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski in Bay County Circuit Court. Named as defendants in the suit are Delta College and former Professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Mason and Jablonski are seeking damages in excess of $25,000, claiming they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they allege. Via a Freedom of Information Act request, The Times obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta College. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22 and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16. Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, the suit and the summary state. Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college. Fonville resigned from Delta Collegeo n Nov. 24, before Brown completed the investigation. Mason and Jablonski's suit asserts they are owed damages under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. The act prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status"" in employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations. In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denies any wrongdoing. The school denies ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Attorney Lenhoff, representing the plaintiffs, has said this response doesn't jibe with Brown's findings. ""This is inconsistent with the investigative report of Delta's Title IX coordinator,"" Lenhoff previously told The Times. ""Delta itself found the credibility of Emily and MaCayla to be high. It found Fonville's credibility was low. Delta found that there was sexual harassment here. I'm surprised at the answer and the answer's allegation is not so. ""Professors and teachers must understand affairs with students and sexual advances on students are just completely inappropriate,"" he continued. ""This case really touches on a major national issue."" Fonville is represented by attorney Anne McClorey McLaughlin of Farmington Hills-based Johnson, Rosati, Schultz & Joppich. ""My client denies that any communication he had with the plaintiffs had any impact on their studies at Delta College,"" McLaughlin said. ""It occurred outside of the time he was their instructor."" Fonville currently lives in Tennessee and was served with the suit there, Lenhoff said. The case is slated for a settlement conference before Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Tuesday, June 13, 2017. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2017/06/delta_college_settles_sexual_h.html,"BAY CITY, MI -- Two female students who alleged a Delta College professor sexually harassed them have dropped their lawsuit against the institution in exchange for a six-figure sum. On Feb. 7, Bay County Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran signed a stipulated order for dismissal in the suit filed by Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski against Delta College and former professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Sheeran dismissed the suit as it had been settled out of court. The settlement agreement, obtained by The Bay City Times-MLive via a Freedom of Information Act request, states Mason and Jablonski will receive $195,000 between them in exchange for releasing Delta and Fonville from all claims they have made against them. The sum is paid by the Michigan Community College Risk Management Authority, Delta's insurance provider. Despite settling, Delta and Fonville assert they are innocent of the plaintiffs' allegations. ""The College and Fonville do not admit, and in fact deny any liability or wrongdoing by entering into this Agreement and enter into this Agreement solely for economic business reasons and to buy their peace,"" the settlement states. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff filed the suit on the women's behalf in July 2016. In it, Jablonski and Mason claimed they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they alleged. Via another Freedom of Information Act request, MLive obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22, 2015, and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16.

The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, according to the suit and summary. Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college. Fonville resigned from Delta College on Nov. 24, 2015, before Brown completed the investigation. In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denied any wrongdoing. The school denied ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Fonville had relocated to Tennessee and was living there when the suit was filed. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/03/grcc_professor_resigns_after_s.html,"(MLive File Photo) GRAND RAPIDS, MI - A longtime Grand Rapids Community College professor, accused of repeatedly kissing a student against her will, resigned the same day he learned school officials would recommend his firing for sexual misconduct, according to documents released by the college. A GRCC investigation, prompted by a student complaint, determined humanities professor Harold Lee violated the school's sexual misconduct policies Lee had been on paid suspension since Dec. 18, 2015, pending the outcome of the investigation. The school later determined Lee had violated two policies, including sexual  assault - which includes non-consensual sexual touching - and those governing relationships with students or subordinates. Lee repeatedly kissed a student on the mouth after they met off-campus for a meal and drinks on Dec.11, according to information obtained from GRCC through a Freedom of Information Act request. Lee later admitted to school officials that their third and last kiss ""felt weird."" ""Lee admitted that he kissed (name redacted) three times over the course of several minutes. Lee admitted that he had no indication this behavior was welcome, and that nothing (redacted) ... did encouraged the kisses.,"" according to school documents. Lee faces no criminal charges from the unwanted kissing, authorities said. The kissing followed a meeting off-campus at a local bar in which Lee and the student had a meal and alcoholic drinks. Lee acknowledged that he drank three or four beers, but claims he would not have engaged in the behavior had he not been drinking. Prior to the three unwanted kisses, the student told the school she felt very uncomfortable at the bar because Lee was sharing ""disgusting details"" about his personal life, including about an addiction to pornography and affairs he'd engaged in previously, documents show. He made multiple calls that night to the student and his number was later blocked.
The student initially thought they were meeting for coffee to discuss another matter, but agreed to the meal after Lee said he was starving. Lee resigned Jan. 8, the same day he was notified that GRCC planned to bring charges against him to the Board of Trustees. The school planned to recommend his immediate termination at the Jan. 25 meeting. GRCC's sexual misconduct policy states, in part: GRCC also said that even if officials assumed Lee's relationship was consensual, his conduct was explicitly prohibited under the policy prohibiting consensual relationships. Lee's behavior ""was harassing, caused embarrassment, and was sexual,"" according to the Corrective Action Notice drawn up by the school. At one point, Lee had described the kiss as ""not sexual,"" but the student said it was sexual, adding ""he tried to use his tongue. I could feel it around my mouth."" The college newspaper, The Collegiate, first reported Lee's resignation. Lee has not been charged with any crime related to this case, police have said. GRCC reports this was not an isolated incident. In its Jan. 8 letter to Lee, they say he acknowledged prior incidents in which he engaged in inappropriate sexual activity related to his employment: • A sexual involvement while at Montcalm Community College, resulting in his resignation in lieu of termination. • Admission to a Kent County Sheriff's Department officer of an incident while in his faculty office at GRCC.

http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2017/12/osu_professor_fired_for_sexual_harassment_bullying_makes_rare_appeal_to_trustees.html,"A veteran Oregon State University professor fired over allegations of sexual harassment and bullying has appealed his dismissal to the school's board of trustees, according to board documents. Oregon State trustees on Dec. 11 will determine the fate of A. Morrie Craig, a toxicology professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine. He was first hired by the university in 1976. Craig's attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The appeal is a rare example of a faculty member fighting for his or her employment by seeking intervention from a school's independent governing board. The university board formed in 2014 following the dissolution of the State Board of Higher Education. ""Usually, matters such as these are settled by a university and the faculty member,"" said Steve Clark, a university spokesman. He said he was not aware of any appeal made to the now-defunct higher education board. Clark declined to provide any specifics surrounding the alleged harassment that led to Craig's termination. ""The university does take complaints of bullying and sexual harassment very seriously,"" he said. Craig is still working at the Corvallis campus pending the outcome of Monday's board meeting. According to university documents shared with the board of trustees, Craig on May 16 was accused of ""engaging in bullying and sexual harassment,"" a violation of school policies punishable by dismissal. Oregon State defines bullying as ""conduct of any sort directed at another that is severe, pervasive, or persistent."" The behavior must be something that would cause someone in the victim's shoes ""substantial emotional distress and undermine his or her ability to work, study or participate in his or her regular life activities."" A special committee of the school's Faculty Senate held a two-day hearing and heard testimony from 18 witnesses. Craig also testified on his own behalf at the hearing, according to the documents. The faculty committee recommended firing Craig on Oct. 23, and Ray sent the letter a week later. University President Ed Ray sent Craig a letter terminating his employment on Oct. 30. Craig petitioned the Benton County Circuit Court on Nov. 6 to review the decision. But Judge Matthew Donohue wrote back the same day to say the court had no jurisdiction. The court documents, which included emails sent by concerned faculty and students, shed some light on the case. One veterinary student wrote to veterinary school dean Dr. Susan Tornquist in May to say she was ""sickened"" by his instruction and demeanor in the classroom. Denise Apperson, the student, listed her concerns: ""The outright falsehoods, the misinterpretation of fundamental science, the misstatements of fact, the manufactured dramatics, all overlain with an overt creepiness."" ""I hope that you understand where my strong words are coming from. I hope that there is a resolution to this."" Apperson, in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, said she could not comment on the case. On Monday, the university's trustees will have a chance to review and discuss the case. The board's 13 members are a mix of prominent business leaders, alumni and educators who are appointed by the governor. Clark said the trustees could vote to: support the university's decision to fire Craig with cause; return the case to the school for additional testimony and review; create a committee of the trustees' board to investigate the issue; or opt for an independent hearings officer to determine Craig's fate. Clark said it's unclear who would make the next move, the Faculty Senate or the school administration, if the board sends the issue back to Oregon State. Monday's meeting is by teleconference, and the public won't be able to call in or stream the meeting online, Clark said. An in-person listening station is available in Room 208 of the Memorial Union. Dr. Linda Blythe, a retired Oregon State veterinary professor who worked closely with Craig for decades, said she did not witness him bully or sexually harass students or researchers. She described the allegations against him as a ""sad end"" to a research career that brought millions of dollars in grants and funding to Oregon State. ""We have had a large number of graduate students come through that lab, and never one complaint in 40 years,"" Blythe said, referring to the decades prior to the university's investigation. Craig's ties to Oregon State are deep. He spent his entire career at the university after earning his doctorate there in 1970. He was granted tenure in 1982 and was recently paid $147,252, according to university records. His parents were also alumni, according to his mother's obituary. Craig founded a lab that tests for toxins in grass and other types of feed, Blythe said. The toxins pose a lethal threat to animals. Detecting them is crucial to farmers in Benton and Linn counties, the hub of Oregon's grass seed industry. The lab also tests for toxins in a variety of samples sent by veterinarians from all over the world, Blythe said. -- Andrew Theen and Molly Young Lynne Palombo of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Karl Kjer, 57, was ordered to have no contact with the teenager he allegedly videotaped with a hidden camera in June 2015, the prosecutor's office said. He must also undergo a mental health evaluation and treatment. Kjer, who now lives in Jersey City, was charged with invasion of privacy in February after the teenager was identified. Authorities said they obtained additional spy camera videos they believe were taped by Kjer, however, the women in those videos have not been identified.

http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2017/06/conviction_overturned_for_professor_accused_of_sex.html,"NEWARK - Former Rutgers-Newark professor Anna Stubblefield, who was accused of sexually assaulting a disabled man who was unable to speak, has had her convictions overturned after an appellate court determined she did not get a fair trial. The court ordered that Stubblefield get another trial overseen by a new judge. The decision was handed down Friday, overturning Stubblefield's two 2015 convictions for first-degree aggravated sexual assault. During the trial, the jury concluded that Stubblefield, then a 39-years-old philosophy professor, had sexually assaulted a then-29-year-old man known only as D.J. in 2011. The man had cerebral palsy and was unable to speak apart from making noises. Psychologists determined that D.J. couldn't consent to sex because he was mentally impaired. During the trial, Stubblefield's lawyers maintained that she and D.J. fell in love and that she was able to communicate with him through a typing method called ""facilitated communication."" Following the conviction, Stubblefield was sentenced to two consecutive 12-year terms in prison and lifetime parole supervision. Much of Stubblefield's case focused on the accuracy and reliability of the controversial typing method, ""facilitated communication,"" which the appellate court referred to as ""FC,"" in its decision. Before the trial, Superior Court Judge Siobhan Teare, who presided over the case, ruled that there could be no expert testimony on the reliability or technique of FC because it wasn't a ""recognized science."" Over the course of Stubblefield's 2015 trial, Essex County prosecutors presented three experts who all testified to D.J.'s mental incapacities. One expert, Dr. Howard Shane, who has a PhD in speech pathologies, testified that the man was not a candidate for augmentative communication devices because of his impaired mental state, the decision said. But Stubblefield's defense attorney had an expert witness too - Dr. Rosemary Crossley, an augmentative and alternative communication specialist from Austrialia who determined that D.J. could communicate and read, according to the decision. Crossley did an extensive, three-day videoed evaluation of D.J., which sought to determine his language and literacy skills and determine if he had, ""communicative intent,"" the decision said. She did use FC in her assessment but nothing that she used the device for factored into her overall assessment of D.J., the defense argued. However, her evaluation and videotape of the assessment were not brought into evidence  - they were deemed unreliable because she had used FC in her assessment, the court ruled. ""The court believed Dr. Crossley's reports and examinations are inadmissible because her communication assessment is based upon an unrecognized field of science known as facilitated communication, rendering Dr. Crossley not an expert and her opinion inadmissible as a net opinion,"" the decision said in an overview of the facts of the case. In the decision, the appellate court sided with Stubblefield's defense attorneys, who claimed that by preventing Crossley from presenting her full evaluation of D.J., the court was preventing the defense attorneys from presenting their full argument. ""The jury and not the court should have ultimately determined whether Dr. Crossley's evaluation was persuasive, and whether the state proved defendant knew or should have known that D.J. could not consent,"" the appellate court ruled. Because they couldn't hear Crossley's full assessment, the jury was left with the impression that no expert or other person - apart from Stubblefield herself - believed that D.J. had the mental abilities to consent to sex, the decision said. ""Unfortunately, the court, in its attempt to cleanse the record of controversial FC methodology, limited the evidence to the extent that defendant was not given a fair opportunity to present her defense,"" the appellate court ruled. The court went on to call the facts of the case ""extraordinary,"" and that they called for ""a liberal admission of evidence supporting defendant's defense."" The appellate court called for a new judge who would allow Crossley to testify regarding her evaluation and who would admit at least parts of her video evaluation into evidence for the jury to view. Stubblefield's case became a national story after her 2011 charges but the interactions date back almost ten years. She first met D.J. through his brother, who was a student in her class, in 2008. Stubblefield, then a department chair at Rutgers University, showed a film to her class regarding FC. The film prompted D.J.'s brother to approach his professor and ask for help for his brother. D.J. could not speak words, wore a diaper and needed help in day-to-day living, according to statement of facts in the decision. The professor began to have meetings with D.J. in 2009 - at first with his parents and then alone in her office. ""(Stubblefield) became convinced that D.J. had been misdiagnosed as having the intellectual ability of a young child,"" the decision said. In May 2011, Stubblefield told D.J.'s parents that she had sexual contact with their son and that they were in love, according to the decision. She then kissed D.J. in front of his parents. D.J.'s parents questioned whether he was capable of consent and tested him with questions only he would know, according to the decision. When they believed he answered the questions incorrectly, they told Stubblefield to stop having contact with their son and called Rutgers University with a complaint. The university reached out to the Essex County Prosecutor's Office who, after an investigation, charged and indicted Stubblefield on two counts of aggravated sexual assault. Stubblefield has never denied having sexual contact with D.J. but she has argued that he was mentally competent enough to consent to their interactions.

http://www.al.com/news/huntsville/index.ssf/2016/03/alabama_am_fires_professor_ove.html,"Alabama A&M University fired a tenured professor in March after the school discovered videos of him participating in sexual activity with two students on campus, according to court documents. The school severed ties with Edward Jones, who has worked more than 20 years at Alabama A&M. Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification. According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M campus, the school said. Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns. Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit. The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M police executed a search warrant, according to court documents. Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M informed Jones he would be fired. ""There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy,"" school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file. According to a memo from Alabama A&M police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012. Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer. In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M administration for ignoring ""red flags"" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't ""play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation."" Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act. ""Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation,"" the lawsuit stated. In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of ""gross professional misconduct."" ""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor,"" the school's statement said. ""The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative. ""The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus.""

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2011/12/calvin_college_letter_says_pro.html,"GRAND RAPIDS — Calvin College leaders sent a letter to students, parents, faculty and staff Friday saying a professor resigned after a student claimed she had a ""multi-year sexual relationship"" with him, a college spokesman confirmed. Matt Kucinski said the letter was sent Friday afternoon. In it, Shirley Hoogstra, Calvin's vice president for student life, said the student alleged in May this year she had carried out the relationship with biology professor Steve Matheson. ""Calvin has strict policies against sexual harassment and this relationship violated Calvin's policies,"" Hoogstra said in the letter. ""These policies recognize there is a power differential between faculty and students. After being confronted by the college with this report, the professor resigned rather than face termination."" The letter goes on to say Calvin administrators launched an ""extensive internal review and investigation,"" which led to the formation of a task force on the matter. The task force was set up to ""educate and protect our community so we can learn together how to prevent and properly address allegations of sexual harassment,"" according to Hoogstra's letter. The task force's formation delayed the news being brought before students because it only recently began meeting, Hoogstra said in the letter. A meeting was scheduled for Tuesday afternoon so students could discuss the matter with Student Senate and school officials. FOX-17 first reported Friday's letter had been sent out.

https://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2013/07/former_central_michigan_univer_1.html,"BAY CITY, MI — In learning he was going to spend nearly six years in a federal prison for amassing a collection of child pornography, a former Central Michigan University professor said his own abuse as a child compelled him to seek out such material. ""My childhood and teen years put some context around what I did,"" William L. Merrill told Judge Thomas L. Ludington on Tuesday, July 23, in U.S. District Court in Bay City.  Merrill, 58, whose CMU research included censorship and the Internet, added that he knew his own past did not excuse such conduct. “I never harmed a child, but I understand children were abused. Because of my collection, children were abused,"" he said. Before Ludington sentenced Merrill to 70 months in prison and five years of supervised release, he asked him how he explained his interest in such material to the extent that he compiled a library of more than 60,000 videos and 100,000 images. Merrill replied that he lived in Europe as a preteen and was involved in recorded sexual activity and that when he began searching the Internet for child pornography, he was looking for himself in such material. “I kept those materials because I felt, emotionally, I was protecting those individuals,” Merrill said. Assistant U.S. Attorney Libby Kelly Dill said that Merrill’s collection depicted  children engaged in violent sexual acts, 90 percent of which was recorded after 1970. Merrill also had images of cartoon violence toward children, Dill said. Merrill in March pleaded guilty to one count of receipt of child pornography, a 20-year felony with a mandatory minimum sentence of five years of incarceration. In pleading, Merrill said that in the summer of 2003, he downloaded a video depicting children engaged in sexual acts. He also said he downloaded some images in his office at CMU. In exchange for his plea, prosecutors dismissed a second count of receipt of child pornography and a charge of possession of child pornography, a 10-year felony. Sitting behind Merrill at his sentencing were his wife, three adult children, siblings and numerous friends and colleagues. An admittedly nervous Merrill apologized to them and to CMU. Merrill’s attorney, Frank Reynolds, said that his client had “tremendous family support.” He added that his wife talked Merrill out of committing suicide once police began investigating him and that Merrill has been receiving mental health treatment. Merrill told Ludington he plans to spend his time in prison continuing to read and learn. “I know through counseling what led to this, what issues I have, and I know I’m never going to repeat these acts of downloading and storing child pornography,"" he said. Merrill’s activities came to authorities’ attention on Oct. 30 when CMU staff noticed 170 gigabytes of data were transferred from a single computer on campus. Staff determined the computer in question was Merrill’s Apple laptop, according to court records. A member of the university’s information technology staff examined Merrill’s laptop and discovered three videos depicting child pornography, court records show. Staff alerted university police of the content. Questioned by police, Merrill said he “was sexually assaulted as a minor and wanted to know if child pornography was as repulsive as he had read about,” according to court records. Merrill went on to tell officers he watched two of the three videos and did not have any more such material. Police in November executed a search warrant at Merrill’s office and home and confiscated numerous video tapes and computers. Officers turned the items over to the FBI, who recovered more than 5,487 images of child porn and 26 similar videos. Merrill resigned from his tenured position at CMU on Nov. 12, after the university suspended him Nov. 5 and launched a separate internal investigation into possible misconduct. The day after his resignation, Merrill was arraigned in Isabella County District Court on single felony counts of distributing or promoting child sexually abusive activity and possessing child sexually abusive material and two counts of using a computer to commit a crime. He was also charged with misdemeanor weapons offense. Merrill on Nov. 20, 2012, was charged federally with one count of possession of child pornography. Isabella County prosecutors dismissed their case once federal authorities picked up the case. A federal grand jury indicted Merrill in December 2012.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2016/09/investigation_found_professor.html,"Delta College.jpg Delta College ( ) BAY CITY, MI -- After two female students accused a professor of making inappropriate sexual advances toward them, Delta College's own investigation concluded it was likely the instructor indeed harassed them. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff on July 12 filed the lawsuit on behalf of Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski in Bay County Circuit Court. Named as defendants in the suit are Delta College and former Professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Mason and Jablonski are seeking damages in excess of $25,000, claiming they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they allege. Via a Freedom of Information Act request, The Times obtained a Title IX investigative summary report from Delta College. The document states the investigation was conducted by Loyce Brown, the school's Title IX equity officer. Mason's and Jablonski's complaints were reported to Brown on Oct. 22 and the investigation concluded on Dec. 7, with the summary report dated Dec. 16. Title IX of Education Amendments of 1972 states, ""No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."" The summary report states the students began following Fonville's Twitter account around the midterm of the winter 2015 semester, as he intended to use the social media site to share class-related material. Personal conversations between the parties began in July, with the interactions beginning to cross the line a week later when Fonville began telling one of the women she was ""smart and attractive"" and ""to stop hitting on him."" He later asked one of the women questions about her boyfriend, the suit and the summary state. Fonville on two occasions visited the same woman's place of employment, unnerving her, she told Brown. The professor also sent the woman a direct message via Twitter which linked to an article entitled ""The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See,"" the report summary says. One of the women in May 2015 and the other in October received anonymous requests for nude photos via Tumblr, and they believed Fonville was behind these, the report states. The women also filed a complaint with the campus Public Safety Department. Fonville was removed from campus on Oct. 26 and was ordered not to contact the women, the report states. Brown on Nov. 3 interviewed Fonville. The professor said he had conversed with one of the women on Twitter. Fonville ""Also stated that the conversations became personal with the complainant within a few days of their initial conversations,"" the report states. ""Because the complainant was not a current student of (Fonville), (he) did not feel his actions were in any way inappropriate. Based on jokes shared in class and conversations between (them), (Fonville) felt they shared  a similar sense of humor which was why he shared the link to the article: The Most Charming Penis You'll Ever See. He also stated that he never perceived that the complainant felt his conversations were inappropriate as she never blocked him or said she did not want to talk to him anymore."" In speaking with Public Safety Director Robert Battinkoff, Fonville denied sending the women anonymous messages via Tumblr seeking nude photos. However, he did say he sent some anonymous Tumblr messages, but did not recall to whom the messages were sent, the report continues. The summary adds the complaining woman's credibility was deemed high. ""She had evidence to support the conversations on Twitter,"" the report states. ""Her friend had similar interactions with (Fonville)."" Fonville's credibility was deemed low in the report. Brown concluded the investigation by stating, based on a more-than-likely standard of proof, it is likely Fonville violated Title IX and Delta College's harassment policy. However, no additional sanctions could be imposed as Fonville was no longer employed by the college. Fonville resigned from Delta Collegeo n Nov. 24, before Brown completed the investigation. Mason and Jablonski's suit asserts they are owed damages under Michigan's Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act of 1976. The act prohibits discrimination on the basis of ""religion, race, color, national origin, age, sex, height, weight, familial status, or marital status"" in employment, housing, education, and access to public accommodations. In Delta's response to the suit, filed by Livonia-based attorney Elizabeth A. Rae-O'Donell, the college denies any wrongdoing. The school denies ""either Plaintiff has been discriminated against on the basis of their sex in the full utilization of benefits, services, activities or programs offered by the College and/or that this Defendant or Defendant Fonville created a sexually hostile education environment for either Plaintiff."" Attorney Lenhoff, representing the plaintiffs, has said this response doesn't jibe with Brown's findings. ""This is inconsistent with the investigative report of Delta's Title IX coordinator,"" Lenhoff previously told The Times. ""Delta itself found the credibility of Emily and MaCayla to be high. It found Fonville's credibility was low. Delta found that there was sexual harassment here. I'm surprised at the answer and the answer's allegation is not so. ""Professors and teachers must understand affairs with students and sexual advances on students are just completely inappropriate,"" he continued. ""This case really touches on a major national issue."" Fonville is represented by attorney Anne McClorey McLaughlin of Farmington Hills-based Johnson, Rosati, Schultz & Joppich. ""My client denies that any communication he had with the plaintiffs had any impact on their studies at Delta College,"" McLaughlin said. ""It occurred outside of the time he was their instructor."" Fonville currently lives in Tennessee and was served with the suit there, Lenhoff said. The case is slated for a settlement conference before Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran on Tuesday, June 13, 2017. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

http://www.mlive.com/news/bay-city/index.ssf/2017/06/delta_college_settles_sexual_h.html,"BAY CITY, MI -- Two female students who alleged a Delta College professor sexually harassed them have dropped their lawsuit against the institution in exchange for a six-figure sum. On Feb. 7, Bay County Circuit Judge Joseph K. Sheeran signed a stipulated order for dismissal in the suit filed by Emily Mason and MaCayla Jablonski against Delta College and former professor Jonathan Brent Fonville. Sheeran dismissed the suit as it had been settled out of court. The settlement agreement, obtained by The Bay City Times-MLive via a Freedom of Information Act request, states Mason and Jablonski will receive $195,000 between them in exchange for releasing Delta and Fonville from all claims they have made against them. The sum is paid by the Michigan Community College Risk Management Authority, Delta's insurance provider. Despite settling, Delta and Fonville assert they are innocent of the plaintiffs' allegations. ""The College and Fonville do not admit, and in fact deny any liability or wrongdoing by entering into this Agreement and enter into this Agreement solely for economic business reasons and to buy their peace,"" the settlement states. Flint attorney Glen N. Lenhoff filed the suit on the women's behalf in July 2016. In it, Jablonski and Mason claimed they endured severe emotional distress, that Fonville interfered with their education, and that he ""created an intimidating, hostile and offensive sex-based educational environment"" for them. In addition, Delta ""took inadequate measures to stop"" the harassment, they alleged.

http://www.mlive.com/news/grand-rapids/index.ssf/2016/03/grcc_professor_resigns_after_s.html,"(MLive File Photo) GRAND RAPIDS, MI - A longtime Grand Rapids Community College professor, accused of repeatedly kissing a student against her will, resigned the same day he learned school officials would recommend his firing for sexual misconduct, according to documents released by the college. A GRCC investigation, prompted by a student complaint, determined humanities professor Harold Lee violated the school's sexual misconduct policies Lee had been on paid suspension since Dec. 18, 2015, pending the outcome of the investigation. The school later determined Lee had violated two policies, including sexual  assault - which includes non-consensual sexual touching - and those governing relationships with students or subordinates. Lee repeatedly kissed a student on the mouth after they met off-campus for a meal and drinks on Dec.11, according to information obtained from GRCC through a Freedom of Information Act request. Lee later admitted to school officials that their third and last kiss ""felt weird."" ""Lee admitted that he kissed (name redacted) three times over the course of several minutes. Lee admitted that he had no indication this behavior was welcome, and that nothing (redacted) ... did encouraged the kisses.,"" according to school documents. Lee faces no criminal charges from the unwanted kissing, authorities said. The kissing followed a meeting off-campus at a local bar in which Lee and the student had a meal and alcoholic drinks. Lee acknowledged that he drank three or four beers, but claims he would not have engaged in the behavior had he not been drinking. Prior to the three unwanted kisses, the student told the school she felt very uncomfortable at the bar because Lee was sharing ""disgusting details"" about his personal life, including about an addiction to pornography and affairs he'd engaged in previously, documents show. He made multiple calls that night to the student and his number was later blocked.
The student initially thought they were meeting for coffee to discuss another matter, but agreed to the meal after Lee said he was starving. Lee resigned Jan. 8, the same day he was notified that GRCC planned to bring charges against him to the Board of Trustees. The school planned to recommend his immediate termination at the Jan. 25 meeting. GRCC's sexual misconduct policy states, in part: GRCC also said that even if officials assumed Lee's relationship was consensual, his conduct was explicitly prohibited under the policy prohibiting consensual relationships. Lee's behavior ""was harassing, caused embarrassment, and was sexual,"" according to the Corrective Action Notice drawn up by the school. At one point, Lee had described the kiss as ""not sexual,"" but the student said it was sexual, adding ""he tried to use his tongue. I could feel it around my mouth."" The college newspaper, The Collegiate, first reported Lee's resignation. Lee has not been charged with any crime related to this case, police have said. GRCC reports this was not an isolated incident. In its Jan. 8 letter to Lee, they say he acknowledged prior incidents in which he engaged in inappropriate sexual activity related to his employment: • A sexual involvement while at Montcalm Community College, resulting in his resignation in lieu of termination. • Admission to a Kent County Sheriff's Department officer of an incident while in his faculty office at GRCC.

http://www.oregonlive.com/education/index.ssf/2017/12/osu_professor_fired_for_sexual_harassment_bullying_makes_rare_appeal_to_trustees.html,"A veteran Oregon State University professor fired over allegations of sexual harassment and bullying has appealed his dismissal to the school's board of trustees, according to board documents. Oregon State trustees on Dec. 11 will determine the fate of A. Morrie Craig, a toxicology professor in the College of Veterinary Medicine. He was first hired by the university in 1976. Craig's attorney did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The appeal is a rare example of a faculty member fighting for his or her employment by seeking intervention from a school's independent governing board. The university board formed in 2014 following the dissolution of the State Board of Higher Education. ""Usually, matters such as these are settled by a university and the faculty member,"" said Steve Clark, a university spokesman. He said he was not aware of any appeal made to the now-defunct higher education board. Clark declined to provide any specifics surrounding the alleged harassment that led to Craig's termination. ""The university does take complaints of bullying and sexual harassment very seriously,"" he said. Craig is still working at the Corvallis campus pending the outcome of Monday's board meeting. According to university documents shared with the board of trustees, Craig on May 16 was accused of ""engaging in bullying and sexual harassment,"" a violation of school policies punishable by dismissal. Oregon State defines bullying as ""conduct of any sort directed at another that is severe, pervasive, or persistent."" The behavior must be something that would cause someone in the victim's shoes ""substantial emotional distress and undermine his or her ability to work, study or participate in his or her regular life activities."" A special committee of the school's Faculty Senate held a two-day hearing and heard testimony from 18 witnesses. Craig also testified on his own behalf at the hearing, according to the documents. The faculty committee recommended firing Craig on Oct. 23, and Ray sent the letter a week later. University President Ed Ray sent Craig a letter terminating his employment on Oct. 30. Craig petitioned the Benton County Circuit Court on Nov. 6 to review the decision. But Judge Matthew Donohue wrote back the same day to say the court had no jurisdiction. The court documents, which included emails sent by concerned faculty and students, shed some light on the case. One veterinary student wrote to veterinary school dean Dr. Susan Tornquist in May to say she was ""sickened"" by his instruction and demeanor in the classroom. Denise Apperson, the student, listed her concerns: ""The outright falsehoods, the misinterpretation of fundamental science, the misstatements of fact, the manufactured dramatics, all overlain with an overt creepiness."" ""I hope that you understand where my strong words are coming from. I hope that there is a resolution to this."" Apperson, in an email to The Oregonian/OregonLive, said she could not comment on the case. On Monday, the university's trustees will have a chance to review and discuss the case. The board's 13 members are a mix of prominent business leaders, alumni and educators who are appointed by the governor. Clark said the trustees could vote to: support the university's decision to fire Craig with cause; return the case to the school for additional testimony and review; create a committee of the trustees' board to investigate the issue; or opt for an independent hearings officer to determine Craig's fate. Clark said it's unclear who would make the next move, the Faculty Senate or the school administration, if the board sends the issue back to Oregon State. Monday's meeting is by teleconference, and the public won't be able to call in or stream the meeting online, Clark said. An in-person listening station is available in Room 208 of the Memorial Union. Dr. Linda Blythe, a retired Oregon State veterinary professor who worked closely with Craig for decades, said she did not witness him bully or sexually harass students or researchers. She described the allegations against him as a ""sad end"" to a research career that brought millions of dollars in grants and funding to Oregon State. ""We have had a large number of graduate students come through that lab, and never one complaint in 40 years,"" Blythe said, referring to the decades prior to the university's investigation. Craig's ties to Oregon State are deep. He spent his entire career at the university after earning his doctorate there in 1970. He was granted tenure in 1982 and was recently paid $147,252, according to university records. His parents were also alumni, according to his mother's obituary. Craig founded a lab that tests for toxins in grass and other types of feed, Blythe said. The toxins pose a lethal threat to animals. Detecting them is crucial to farmers in Benton and Linn counties, the hub of Oregon's grass seed industry. The lab also tests for toxins in a variety of samples sent by veterinarians from all over the world, Blythe said. -- Andrew Theen and Molly Young Lynne Palombo of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

Karl Kjer, 57, was ordered to have no contact with the teenager he allegedly videotaped with a hidden camera in June 2015, the prosecutor's office said. He must also undergo a mental health evaluation and treatment. Kjer, who now lives in Jersey City, was charged with invasion of privacy in February after the teenager was identified. Authorities said they obtained additional spy camera videos they believe were taped by Kjer, however, the women in those videos have not been identified. It was unclear how Kjer knew the women or why the teen was at his home. Luke Nozicka may be reached at lnozicka@njadvancemedia.com. Follow him on Twitter @lukenozicka. Find NJ.com on Facebook.

http://www.nj.com/essex/index.ssf/2017/06/conviction_overturned_for_professor_accused_of_sex.html,"NEWARK - Former Rutgers-Newark professor Anna Stubblefield, who was accused of sexually assaulting a disabled man who was unable to speak, has had her convictions overturned after an appellate court determined she did not get a fair trial. The court ordered that Stubblefield get another trial overseen by a new judge. The decision was handed down Friday, overturning Stubblefield's two 2015 convictions for first-degree aggravated sexual assault. During the trial, the jury concluded that Stubblefield, then a 39-years-old philosophy professor, had sexually assaulted a then-29-year-old man known only as D.J. in 2011. The man had cerebral palsy and was unable to speak apart from making noises. Psychologists determined that D.J. couldn't consent to sex because he was mentally impaired. During the trial, Stubblefield's lawyers maintained that she and D.J. fell in love and that she was able to communicate with him through a typing method called ""facilitated communication."" Following the conviction, Stubblefield was sentenced to two consecutive 12-year terms in prison and lifetime parole supervision. Much of Stubblefield's case focused on the accuracy and reliability of the controversial typing method, ""facilitated communication,"" which the appellate court referred to as ""FC,"" in its decision. Before the trial, Superior Court Judge Siobhan Teare, who presided over the case, ruled that there could be no expert testimony on the reliability or technique of FC because it wasn't a ""recognized science."" Over the course of Stubblefield's 2015 trial, Essex County prosecutors presented three experts who all testified to D.J.'s mental incapacities. One expert, Dr. Howard Shane, who has a PhD in speech pathologies, testified that the man was not a candidate for augmentative communication devices because of his impaired mental state, the decision said. But Stubblefield's defense attorney had an expert witness too - Dr. Rosemary Crossley, an augmentative and alternative communication specialist from Austrialia who determined that D.J. could communicate and read, according to the decision. Crossley did an extensive, three-day videoed evaluation of D.J., which sought to determine his language and literacy skills and determine if he had, ""communicative intent,"" the decision said. She did use FC in her assessment but nothing that she used the device for factored into her overall assessment of D.J., the defense argued. However, her evaluation and videotape of the assessment were not brought into evidence  - they were deemed unreliable because she had used FC in her assessment, the court ruled. ""The court believed Dr. Crossley's reports and examinations are inadmissible because her communication assessment is based upon an unrecognized field of science known as facilitated communication, rendering Dr. Crossley not an expert and her opinion inadmissible as a net opinion,"" the decision said in an overview of the facts of the case. In the decision, the appellate court sided with Stubblefield's defense attorneys, who claimed that by preventing Crossley from presenting her full evaluation of D.J., the court was preventing the defense attorneys from presenting their full argument. ""The jury and not the court should have ultimately determined whether Dr. Crossley's evaluation was persuasive, and whether the state proved defendant knew or should have known that D.J. could not consent,"" the appellate court ruled. Because they couldn't hear Crossley's full assessment, the jury was left with the impression that no expert or other person - apart from Stubblefield herself - believed that D.J. had the mental abilities to consent to sex, the decision said. ""Unfortunately, the court, in its attempt to cleanse the record of controversial FC methodology, limited the evidence to the extent that defendant was not given a fair opportunity to present her defense,"" the appellate court ruled. The court went on to call the facts of the case ""extraordinary,"" and that they called for ""a liberal admission of evidence supporting defendant's defense."" The appellate court called for a new judge who would allow Crossley to testify regarding her evaluation and who would admit at least parts of her video evaluation into evidence for the jury to view. Stubblefield's case became a national story after her 2011 charges but the interactions date back almost ten years. She first met D.J. through his brother, who was a student in her class, in 2008. Stubblefield, then a department chair at Rutgers University, showed a film to her class regarding FC. The film prompted D.J.'s brother to approach his professor and ask for help for his brother. D.J. could not speak words, wore a diaper and needed help in day-to-day living, according to statement of facts in the decision. The professor began to have meetings with D.J. in 2009 - at first with his parents and then alone in her office. ""(Stubblefield) became convinced that D.J. had been misdiagnosed as having the intellectual ability of a young child,"" the decision said. In May 2011, Stubblefield told D.J.'s parents that she had sexual contact with their son and that they were in love, according to the decision. She then kissed D.J. in front of his parents. D.J.'s parents questioned whether he was capable of consent and tested him with questions only he would know, according to the decision. When they believed he answered the questions incorrectly, they told Stubblefield to stop having contact with their son and called Rutgers University with a complaint. The university reached out to the Essex County Prosecutor's Office who, after an investigation, charged and indicted Stubblefield on two counts of aggravated sexual assault. Stubblefield has never denied having sexual contact with D.J. but she has argued that he was mentally competent enough to consent to their interactions.

David Lassman / The Post-Standard (David Lassman | dlassman@syracuse.com) SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Syracuse University has dismissed a male professor who had a consensual relationship with a female undergraduate student. The faculty member, who SU has not identified, taught, advised and supervised the student during the relationship. It is the first time in decades a tenured professor at SU has been terminated through this process. The dismissal is effective today and was announced by Chancellor Kent Syverud in his weekly email to the campus community. Syverud first described the case and the proceedings against the tenured associate professor in May. The charges against the professor were first lodged last year. A hearing panel of three faculty members deliberated and found that the associate professor violated the consensual relationships provision of the policy on inappropriate conduct by faculty members and the University Code of Ethical Conduct. The panel recommended the professor be dismissed and that his tenure be revoked. Syverud accepted the finding and recommendation, he said. The average salary for an associate SU professor in 2012-2013 was $87,700. The faculty member asked the board of trustees to review the case. Last week after hearing verbal arguments from the professor and the university, trustees upheld the hearing panel's findings.

http://www.cleveland.com/court-justice/index.ssf/2013/10/case_law_professor_sues_dean_l.html,"IMG_4000_15285373.JPG Case Law School Dean Lawrence Mitchell (Case Western Reserve University) CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Case
Western Reserve Law Professor Raymond Ku filed a lawsuit today against Law
School Dean Lawrence Mitchell and the university alleging that he reported that
Mitchell had potentially sexually harassed a woman and suffered retaliation. Ku,
a former associate dean at the law school, reported in 2011 potential
instances of Mitchell harassing law school faculty and staff, according to the
civil law suit filed in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court. (See the full complaint in the document viewer below.) University officials responded to the lawsuit this afternoon with the following statement: ""This situation is categorically not an instance of retaliation. Professor Ku continues to hold a full-time, tenured faculty position at the School of Law. The lawsuit itself includes inaccuracies, as well as an inflammatory flier that has been found to be materially false. The university will have additional comment upon more thorough review of the suit and opposing counsel's press release."" In the suit, Ku alleges that he made reports to the university's provost, vice president for
diversity and faculty diversity officer. Ku
said he personally witnessed Mitchell caressing a female staff member at a
party and was made aware of allegations by other women at the university that
Mitchell had made inappropriate comments to others. The
issue of Mitchell's sexual conduct also came up at a January 2012 City Club
event, according to the suit, when flyers were passed out with questions about Mitchell's
alleged relationships with female students,  and an alleged comment to staff that one graduate
student ""wasn't good for anything but keeping the bed warm."" According
to the suit, Mitchell threatened to fire Ku – a tenured professor since 2003 –
and stripped him of many duties as an associate dean and later his
co-directorship of the Center for Law, Technology & the Arts. He also
reduced his pay, according to the suit. Mitchell could not be reached by phone or email for comment Wednesday. The
suit also alleges that the university was aware of prior concerns about
potential sexual misconduct by Mitchell during his time at George Washington
University, including a reported relationship with a law student. He was hired
by Case in 2011 after an extended search for a new law school dean. The
suit details various people in positions of leadership at Case that Ku and his
attorneys say he reported the concerns to, including a formal complaint he
filed. Another
staff member who reported to Provost W.A. Baeslack that Mitchell was having a
sexual relationship with a Case law student was reassigned and later laid off,
according to the suit. Attorney
Subodh Chandra, whose firm is representing Ku, said Mitchell continued to retaliate
against Professor Ku, even after the university's Chief Litigation counsel met
with law school faculty and staff, warning them to follow the university's
sexual harassment reporting policy. ""Professor Ku paid a high price for doing what
was both required and right—standing up for victims at great personal risk and
reporting to
senior university officials Dean Mitchell's potential harassment,"" Chandra
said. ""But retaliation is illegal and a law-school dean should know he is not
above the law."" Chandra
questioned now whether Case would continue to back Mitchell.  "" The only
question now is whether Case will continue to back Mitchell or ""live up to its
own policies and ideals for the sake of its students, staff, and faculty."" Case spokesman William Lubinger also provided a statement from B. Jessie Hill, Case Law's Associate Dean for Faculty Development and Research. ""Dean Mitchell has worked to increase diversity and equity since he arrived at our law school,"" said the emailed statement. ""He has addressed historical pay disparities between male and female faculty, launched a dynamic Women's Law and Leadership Initiative, and increased the proportion of women and underrepresented minorities within our recent entering classes."" Hill was not available for an interview but her statement said she had not experienced or observed inappropriate behavior from Mitchell. Ku's suit says that no women have joined Case's Law School faculty since Mitchell took over and several women have left from both faculty and staff positions. He also alleged that Mitchell made comments about Ku's Chinese heritage and conversion to Judaism.

http://www.pennlive.com/news/2017/02/former_30-year_employee_sues_p.html,"Penn State Old Main Penn State's Old Main ( File photo) WILLIAMSPORT -- A former Penn State employee has accused the university of gender discrimination, sexual harassment, hostile work environment and retaliation. Joane Stoneberg, who in her 30 years of employment rose from a part-time transcript clerk to programs coordinator in the College of Arts and Architecture, made the claims in a civil rights suit filed Monday in U.S. Middle District Court. Stoneberg, who now lives in Reisterstown, Maryland, says she took early retirement in October 2014 because her supervisors failed to act on her complaints. The suit accuses Curt Marshall, coordinator of multicultural programs in the college, with ""infecting"" her workplace with sexually offensive comments and conduct. The complaint says that beginning in November 2006, when they shared an office suite, Marshall made offensive and inappropriate sexual comments, forwarded her sexually inappropriate emails, propositioned her, commented on her looks and shared intimate details about his marital sex life. When she advised Gary Kesler, then associate dean of the arts college, of her intention to pursue a sexual harassment complaint against Marshall, she claims she was urged not to but to let him handle it informally. Shortly after that discussion, Marshall apologized, but Stoneberg says she spent the next five years avoiding him. She claims he resumed his offensive behavior in March 2014, including hugging her twice in front of co-workers when Kessler was off work due to illness. When Stoneberg made a sexual harassment complaint against Marshall to Yvonne Guadelius, associate vice president and senior associate dean of undergraduate education, she was told to call a new sexual harassment hotline, the suit states. Because the hot line was for students, not staff,  she lodged her complaint with Kenneth Lehman III, vice provost for affirmative action. At an April 14, 2014, meeting with him, Stoneberg said she was told Marshall would be required to take a sexual harassment class and they would not share office space, the suit states. Marshall never moved, so Stoneberg claims she was forced to temporarily move to another building. When she notified her supervisor she was considering leaving the university, the suit states, a new position was created for her but it stripped her of her high-level responsibilities. She claims that being forced to take the entry-level position providing academic advising to undergraduates and doing new student orientation in the summer was humiliating, embarrassing and demeaning. As program coordinator, Stoneberg said, she chaired and co-chaired committees, participated in high-level admissions decisions, ran the new student orientation and organized academic advising. The suit accuses Lehman of not forcing Marshall to move from the shared office, not interviewing Stoneberg as part of any investigation and failing to respond in any way to her complaint. Forcing her to change jobs was retaliation for her pursuing her sexual harassment complaint, she charges. Were it not for the retaliation, Stoneberg said, she would have remained at the university until July 1, 2015, her original planned retirement date. She is seeking unspecified damages and the compensation she would have received had she remained until her planned retirement date. The filing of the complaint followed her receipt in January of a right-to-sue letter from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Penn State does not comment on pending litigation, spokeswoman Lisa M. Powers said Tuesday.

https://www.al.com/news/huntsville/2018/12/una-professor-accused-of-sexual-harassment-terminated.html,"University of North Alabama professor Greg Gaston was found in violation of Title IX for sexual harassment and was subsequently fired. At least three women contacted UNA’s Title IX office to report Gaston for inappropriate behavior. Gaston was placed on a no trespass order on June 22, 2018, dependent on the results of the Title IX investigation, that barred him from UNA’s campus and university-sponsored events. Payton Gilchrist was the first to file a complaint against Gaston in June 2018. Gilchrist said Gaston was known for making inappropriate comments during class, but crossed a line when he asked her to take a vacation with him. Gilchrist declined, but Gaston continued to pursue a romantic relationship with her. “[Gaston] would make sexist comments in class, he would show favoritism toward females. There were a lot of behaviors of Dr. Gaston that was inappropriate that people would brush off,” Gilchirst said in an interview with AL.com. When UNA’s student newspaper, the FlorAla, published that Gaston was given a no trespass order, more women came forward to UNA’s Title IX office with accusations of sexual harassment against Gaston. Amanda Gallagher, who graduated from UNA in 2013, was one of them. “Immediately I knew what [the no trespass order] had been about because of my and my friends experiences,” Gallagher said. Gallagher said Gaston had commented on the size of her breasts and touched her inappropriately when she was a student at UNA. “I was standing in the hallway of the geology department talking to a friend and he walked by and he rubbed his hand across my ass,”Gallagher said. “I stopped talking and he looked at me and he said he was feeling for a panty line.” The Title IX investigation took six months, in part, Gilchrist said, because of the women who continued to come forward. In a letter to Gaston on Dec. 17, Tammy Jacques, Title IX Coordinator wrote “Given the documentation and witness interviews obtained during this investigation, you have been found responsible for violating the Sexual Misconduct policy (specifically Sexual Harassment) and UNA’s Policy on Consensual Relationships. The Title IX office is recommending that your employment be terminated for cause and compliance with Section 2.6.2 of the Faculty Handbook.” That same day, UNA Vice President for academic affairs Ross Alexander sent a letter of termination to Gaston. “I feel incredibly proud of Payton for having the bravery to come forward,” Gallagher said. “It’s not an easy thing, and I think the backlash, the response to the investigation, shows there’s still an uphill battle for women to report sexual indecency, especially for men in positions of power.” Gaston did not respond to requests for comment.

https://www.nj.com/middlesex/2019/02/ex-rutgers-med-school-doctor-accused-of-recording-women-in-bathroom-identity-theft-gun-charge-in-160-count-indictment.html,"A former Rutgers medical school professor and director at the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey has been accused of recording at least 26 women and three other people in various states of undress in a bathroom and breaking into his colleague’s offices to commit identity theft, among other charges in a sweeping 160-count indictment of alleged illegal activity over a two year span. Dr. James Goydos, 58, a then-professor of surgery Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, was initially arrested in March 2018 and charged with having an unregistered and unlicensed assault rifle after police searched his East Brunswick home. At the time, Goydos was put on leave from Rutgers, where he specialized in melanoma treatment, and authorities declined to say what prompted the search. The indictment against Goydos issued in December, however, revealed a wide range of charges involving accusations at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey offices in New Brunswick and elsewhere in Middlesex County dating to April 2016. The charges include: invasion of privacy (more than 100 counts), official misconduct, burglary, computer theft, impersonation, wiretapping, falsely implicating another, coercion, hindering, possession of an assault rifle and possession of a prohibited device. He is next due in court in March. Goydos is no longer employed at Rutgers, Peter McDonough Jr., a Rutgers spokesman, confirmed in an email this week. McDonough said that none of the allegations were related to patient care. Goydos earned a $437,500 while working at Rutgers, according to public records. A message left at Goydos’s East Brunswick home was not returned and an attempt to reach him on social media was unsuccessful. His attorney did not return a message. According to the 41-page indictment, Goydos entered offices of four people in the Cancer Institute of New Jersey during 2016 and stole information from their computers in a “scheme to defraud, or to obtain services, property, personal identifying information or money.” He then impersonated the employees to get “benefit for himself or another, or to injure or defraud another,” according to the indictment. Additional official misconduct charges have been brought against him for using his status as a Rutgers employee to access the computers and information. In 2017, Goydos is accused of filming or photographing, without their consent, 26 women and three others whose genders were not identified, obtaining images of them in various stages of undress, according to the indictment. Andrea Boulton, a spokeswoman for the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office, said the victims were not photographed or filmed in Goydos’s capacity as a physician, but in a bathroom at his workplace. McDonough said the university immediately contacted the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office after learning of Goydos’s activities. Goydos was indicted after a joint investigation from the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office and the Rutgers University Police Department, according to the prosecutor’s office. His LinkedIn profile lists his job as the director of the Melanoma and Soft Tissue Oncology Program at RWJ, and indicates he started working at Rutgers in 1995. He also studied medicine at RWJ during the 1980s. Amanda Hoover can be reached at ahoover@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @amandahoovernj. Find NJ.com on Facebook.

https://www.mlive.com/news/2019/04/university-of-michigan-opera-professor-harassed-student-remains-on-payroll.html,"ANN ARBOR, MI -- The University of Michigan last month determined that tenured professor David Daniels, a world-famous opera singer, sexually harassed at least one student in March 2017, according to an email obtained by The Ann Arbor News/MLive. The university’s Office of Institutional Equity sent the email to a student on March 27, substantiating findings that Daniels violated policy when he offered to pay the student $300 for sex using the Grindr hookup phone application in March 2017. The Ann Arbor News/MLive obtained the email from the student, a 23-year-old senior majoring in voice and economics. A UM spokesman declined comment, citing its policy not to discuss sexual misconduct investigations. Based on police reports and interviews with the student, who The Ann Arbor News/MLive has agreed not to name, the student provided UM police screen shots of the inappropriate online chat in July, although the OIE didn’t contact him until November or complete its investigation until eight months later. The student called the investigation a “no-brainer” that “should not take that long.” “Professor Daniels disagrees with the findings and looks forward to the time when all of the facts of this matter are made known,"" said attorney Fran Stacy, who represents Daniels. “We would caution against drawing any conclusions at this time.” Daniels has been at the center of controversy since last August when he and his husband, William Scott Walters, were accused of raping a man in Houston in 2010. He was also named in a civil lawsuit in which Daniels is accused of tricking another student into take a sleeping pill before molesting him. Daniels remains on the UM payroll, earning a salary of more than $191,000 per year, according to online salary records, but hasn’t taught in at least seven months. In response to mounting allegations of sexual impropriety, UM placed Daniels on paid leave and ordered him to stay off campus in August. The university first received anonymous complaints alleging Daniels propositioned two students over Grindr on March 29, 2018. The OIE, tasked with investigating sexual misconduct claims made against professors, closed its original investigation after investigators were unable to contact any victims. Daniels, who denied the allegations, was, however, reminded of UM’s sexual harassment, dating and social media use policies. Weeks later, the UM Board of Regents voted unanimously to grant Daniels’ tenure. Elected members of the Board of Regents have not responded to requests from the Ann Arbor News/MLive for comment.  University representatives, including the Board of Regents, have also refused to comment on the Daniels investigations, and have declined multiple public records requests submitted by The Ann Arbor News/MLive. Subsequently, it is unclear when the original investigation was officially closed, if there are any pending misconduct investigations or whether the Board of Regents was made aware of claims prior to granting Daniels tenure. The Grindr claims re-emerged in July after the Board of Regents and other UM officials received an anonymous email alleging Daniels and Walters “drugged and raped a young singer"" following a performance Daniels starred in at the Houston Grand Opera in 2010. While Walters and Daniels told UM police they had a sexual encounter with the the singer, later revealed to be Samuel Schultz, after providing him the prescription drug Ambien, they maintain the sex was consensual and that they stopped when Schultz appeared to be inebriated. The UM sexual assault investigation was forwarded to Houston police. The Harris County, Texas Prosecutor’s Office in January charged Daniels and Walters each with a count of second-degree sexual assault. Daniels and Walters were arrested and later freed on bond. They’re scheduled to appear in a Houston Courtroom on June 10 for a pretrial conference. During that investigation, UM Deputy Police Chief Melissa Overton said detectives learned of five claims involving current or former students alleging they were solicited by Daniels using Grindr. Messages between Daniels and one student indicate Daniels knew the student and realized he was being inappropriate. At one point in the online conversation, after realizing he was communicating with a professor in the school where he attended class, the student typed, “this is not OK.” Daniels apologized for “drunkenly” crossing the line and asked the student to keep their communication secret, especially since he was “one year from tenure.” The student told The Ann Arbor News/MLive he didn’t report the incident but did tell a friend and his parents about it and agreed to be interviewed by UM police when detectives contacted him in July 2018. Andrew Lipian, a graduate student, filed a civil lawsuit against Daniels and UM in federal court in October, alleging Daniels sexually assaulted him in March 2017. Lipian’s lawsuit says he was invited to Daniels’ apartment to watch “Ru Paul’s Drag Race,” because Daniels was “lonely” and wanted to discuss Lipian’s singing career. After serving Lipian several pours of bourbon, the lawsuit claimed Lipian told Daniels he was tired and needed sleep for a performance the next day. The lawsuit alleges Daniels handed Lipian what he said was a Tylenol PM, but was actually the sleep medication Ambien. Daniels then removed Lipian’s clothes, forced himself upon Lipian and groped and touched his genitals and face, according to the lawsuit. Daniels called Lipian’s claims “fake and malicious"" in a December counterclaim alleging an invasion of privacy and infliction of emotional distress. Daniels, in court filings said Lipian, a friend since 2012, “behaved in a sexually suggestive or romantic manner” toward Daniels, and “especially"" Walters. The lawsuit against Daniels, as well as Daniels’ counterclaims against Lipian, were dismissed by U.S. District Judge Arthur A. Tarnow on Thursday, Feb. 21. “The federal claims were dismissed against my client because they were improperly brought,” said Francyne Stacey, the attorney defending Daniels in the civil lawsuit “If Mr. Lipian refiles in state court, he will face the same counterclaims.” The portion of the lawsuit filed against UM remains in federal court and more broadly accuses the university of being “deliberately indifferent” to various allegations made against Daniels, because of his value and status as a “renowned singer.” The university said it appropriately investigated and responded to the misconduct investigations involving Daniels. The student Daniels propositioned, however, criticized what he calls “radio silence” from administrators since allegations came to light and feels the OIE reacted too slowly. “I get a certain amount of discretion, contractually, legally, but the speed of it is the main thing,” he said. ""If the investigation took two months, which is what I’d consider a reasonable time to investigate this, it could have been done with last semester.  ""Instead he continues to be on the payroll ... "" While the university has options should it decide to fire, demote or sanction Daniels for the policy violation finding, the process is complicated by his tenure. The university declined to comment on whether it plans to seek disciplinary action. If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2020/03/um-regents-vote-to-fire-david-daniels-tenured-opera-professor-accused-of-sexual-misconduct.html,"ANN ARBOR, MI — The University of Michigan Board of Regents Thursday unanimously voted to remove opera professor David Daniels from his tenured position, as well as deny eligibility for severance pay. UM President Mark Schlissel recommended Daniel’s firing, calling the renowned countertenor’s conduct “inconsistent with the character of tenure at the University of Michigan and therefore constitutes cause for dismissal.” A number of former students have accused of Daniels of sexual harassment and abuse. Regent Ron Weiser said it was the first time in 60 years that a faculty member’s tenure has been revoked. “At the heart of every decision of the board is the safety and well being of our students,” Weiser said. “... When the board sees this jeopardized by a tenured member of the faculty, we believe it’s necessary to take extreme action or dismissal.” A few public speakers opposed removing Daniels’ tenure, including two opera singers who said Daniels has helped many students further their opera careers, and called the recommendation to fire Daniels “ridiculous.” Daniels was placed on paid leave in August 2018 after several sexually charged claims, including accusations that he solicited students online for sex, drugged and raped a Rice University student with his husband, William A. Scott Walters, and assaulted another student who is suing the university. Daniels and Walters have denied the allegations. Daniels was awarded tenure less than two months after UM received an anonymous complaint alleging he used the dating app Grindr to offer a student money in exchange for sex. The regents unanimously approved tenure for Daniels in May 2018, based on multiple recommendations from students and faculty. UM professor tenured weeks after complaint of Grindr proposition Court documents filed last month showed faculty members at UM’s School of Music, Theatre and Dance expressed concern over the hiring of Daniels in 2015. One faculty member expressed a need to “tell him to keep his hands off” students. The process to terminate Daniels was started by School of Music, Dance and Theatre Dean David Gier in 2019. A hearing followed, resulting in Schlissel’s recommendation to fire the professor. Daniels’ attorney Francyne Stacey earlier this week called Schlissel’s recommendation a mistake, but said ""it’s not my decision to make.” UM is currently investigating sexual misconduct allegations against late athletic doctor Robert Anderson and provost Martin Philbert. Jason Mars, an assistant professor of computer science at UM, is also being investigated for inappropriate behavior and resigned as CEO of Clinc, an AI startup based in Ann Arbor. UM has not opened an investigation into Mars.

https://www.nj.com/news/2008/11/a_sussex_county_community_coll.html,"A Sussex County Community College professor is suing the school, claiming she was sexually harassed by a superior who retaliated against her when she rejected his advances, and that she was improperly denied a promotion. The professor, Darla Silverman, is seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, fees and costs from the college. The civil suit, made public today in Superior Court in Newton, names as defendants the college, its president, Constance Mierendorf, vice president Harry Damato and associate professor of psychology Richard Linden. Kathleen Scott, a spokeswoman for the college, declined comment on the lawsuit.Silverman was hired by the Newton school as an assistant professor of psychology in 2000. In her lawsuit, Silverman alleges that during the first two years of her employment, in which she was not yet tenured, Linden made ""numerous inappropriate advances to her."" Because Linden was the only other member of the psychology department and would have a say in whether she got tenure, she did not confront him about his behavior. Instead, she alerted Damato, who told her to just ""be patient"" with Linden, the lawsuit states. According to the lawsuit, Silverman and Linden attended a conference in the Catskills in 2002. They had adjoining hotel rooms and at one point, Linden entered Silverman's room, hugged and tried to kiss her, but she spurned his advances, according to the suit. He later told her he was in love with her, but she again rebuffed him, the complaint states. After that, his behavior toward her turned ""dramatically negative"" and he began to harass her, and humiliate her in front of students and colleagues, the lawsuit states. Two colleagues who witnessed Linden's alleged harassment reported it to the college's human resources department in 2004, and Silverman gave a formal statement, according to the lawsuit. However, a former vice president at the school ""expressed annoyance"" that Silverman raised the issue and directed the pair to have only minimal as-needed contact, the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit also claims Silverman was passed over in 2006 for a new position, dean of auxiliary academic services, even though a search committee found she was the most qualified candidate, according to the lawsuit. A man was hired but quit on the first day due to an illness. Silverman then got the post, but it was reclassified as an executive assistant to a vice president and with less pay, but had the same duties as a dean. She took the job anyway, with the promise of being named a dean after six to 12 months, the lawsuit states. But Mierendorf, who became SCCC president in 2007, did not make Silverman a dean, and told her she was ""being a baby,"" the lawsuit claims. In April, Silverman resigned the post and became a tenured professor. The college then made her former position a dean, and hired a former colleague of Mierendorf's from Raritan Valley Community College in Somerset County, the lawsuit states.

https://www.nj.com/education/2019/11/veteran-rutgers-professor-under-investigation-for-sexual-harassment-retires.html,"A prominent Rutgers University political science professor under investigation for sexually harassing a graduate student nearly two decades ago retired earlier this month, a university spokeswoman confirmed. Stephen Bronner, a renowned political theorist and professor for more than four decades, had been sidelined from teaching this year while the university investigated a claim he had inappropriately touched a student during a meeting in his office. University spokeswoman Dory Devlin confirmed Bronner retired on Nov. 1. But Devlin said on Friday she was unable to determine the status of the investigation. An attorney for Kristy King, the former graduate student and now a Arizona State University professor, told NJ Advance Media the investigation is ongoing, and expected the university to see the case through. “We know that our client’s complaint is still being investigated, and Dr. Bronner’s retirement in no way changes our expectation that Rutgers conduct a fair and thorough investigation and that it implement all necessary changes to its policies,"" said Iliana Konidaris, one of King’s attorneys. “The culture in Rutgers’ Political Science Department must change, and it’s unfortunate that it has taken so long,” Konidaris said. “We are committed to ensuring a fair process for our client and for others who come forward in the future.” Bronner, 70, could not be reached for comment. But he has previously denied any misconduct, and said he had no recollection of the incident. King claimed Bronner ran his hand up thigh on her first day at Rutgers nearly 20 years ago, according to the complaint she filed last year, along with other allegations of sexual harassment against him. The encounter always troubled her, she said, and she filed the claim years later because she was inspired by the #metoo movement. “I don’t have any knowledge that his retirement is related to my persistence, but I still have plenty of opinions,"" King said. The university told her it typically did not investigate incidents more than two years old. But Rutgers dropped that two-year policy within hours of the publication of an NJ Advance Media report in October 2018, detailing King’s case and several incidents involving other professors. The university also formed a task force, which in May recommended major changes to its sexual misconduct policy, including a ban on dating relationships between professors and students. According to his university biography, Bronner was director of Global Relations at the Center for the Study of Genocide, Conflict Resolution, and Human Rights at Rutgers, and member of the Executive Committee of the UNESCO Chair for Genocide Prevention. He published 25 books and 200 journal articles, the biography said. In a Nov. 3 Facebook post, Bronner announced his retirement after 43 years of teaching and alluded to two manuscripts in the works. He made no mention of the investigation, but lamented the change of direction and “debilitating conflicts” inside the political science department. “Debilitating conflicts have soured the atmosphere, the professional and pedagogic culture is changing, new students who share my interests are not being admitted, and I have no graduate classes to teach,” Bronner wrote. “Like any relationship, however, this one should not be judged by how it ends. I have had the opportunity to pursue my research and I was lucky enough to receive three teaching awards.” Bronner taught “thousands of undergraduates” and supervised more than 50 doctoral candidates, his post said. Richard Lau, chairman of the political science department, notified colleagues of Bronner’s departure in an email last Friday. “(Bronner) plans to devote more time to his new conflict resolution NGO (non-governmental organization) International Council for Diplomacy and Dialogue,"" Lau’s announcement said. “I want to thank Steve for all of his contributions to the department over the past 43 years, and wish him great success with his new mission and in all his future endeavors.” NJ Advance Media Staff Writer Kelly Heyboer contributed to this report.

https://www.oregonlive.com/business/2019/12/longtime-linfield-college-board-member-david-jubb-sexually-assaulted-student-lawsuit-says.html,"A member of Linfield College’s board of trustees resigned earlier this year after a student who also served on the board complained that he sexually assaulted her as they were leaving a faculty-trustee dinner and later at a bar where the trustees had gathered, according to a federal suit. AnnaMarie Motis told the board’s chair that trustee David Jubb put his hands up her dress twice on an evening in February and touched her buttocks and genitalia, the suit says. Her suit, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Portland, accuses Jubb of battery and the college of negligence in failing to protect her. She’s seeking at least $550,000 in damages. “The former trustee involved in this complaint is no longer a member of the Board and has not attended any college functions since we were made aware of the allegation,’’ Linfield College spokesman Scott Nelson said in a statement. Jubb, 70, is a 1971 Linfield College graduate and had served on the board since 1994, chairing its financial affairs committee, according to a college magazine. He’s a retired partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers and is a board member of The Reser Family Foundation. The Oregonian/OregonLive generally doesn’t identify alleged victims of sexual abuse but Motis said she wanted to be named. She was an undergraduate student representative on the college’s board when she attended a faculty-trustees dinner on Feb. 15 at Michelbook Country Club after a board meeting. She was invited to join other trustees at a bar following the dinner. Jubb said he would pay for an Uber and insisted that Motis accompany him to the bar, Nick’s Backroom in McMinnville, according to her suit. As they waited in the foyer of the country club for their ride, the student said Jubb told her he was staying at the Atticus hotel in downtown McMinnville and would bring her with him after they met others at the bar and ""end the night there,'' the suit says. Motis said Jubb grabbed her and pulled her body to his. She objected, telling him, “I feel like that’s a little close,’” the suit says. Jubb didn’t stop and reached under her skirt and aggressively grabbed her bare buttocks, the suit alleges. The student stepped away, the suit says, and told Jubb, “That’s definitely not something I’m comfortable with.’’ Another trustee entered the foyer and offered the student and Jubb a ride to the bar. Once they arrived, they learned Nick’s was closed, so the trustees decided to go to another bar in downtown McMinnville, The Oak. Once at The Oak, the student sat opposite Jubb at a narrow table. He “aggressively bumped” her legs under the table, according to the suit. She moved her chair to be further away, but Jubb pulled her chair closer to him, “then thrust his hand’’ under her dress and touched her genitalia, the suit says. Motis immediately left the table and told others she needed to leave. Within a week, the student reported Jubb’s behavior to the board chair and to the college. The chair assured Motis that Jubb would be removed from the board by May, the suit says. Nelson said when Motis reported the “inappropriate advances,’’ college officials advised her of her options, including going to the McMinnville Police Department and having the college conduct a Title IX sexual harassment investigation. Nelson did not say whether the college contacted McMinnville police. “In every case of an allegation like this, we advise the students of their options on-campus and off, including going to the police. We offer them resources and help, depending upon what they would like to do. But we would never disclose a student’s decisions without their permission,’’ Nelson said. The student went to McMinnville police on March 20, according to her lawyers, Erin Greenawald and Sean Riddell. Jubb resigned from the board in June. He did not return multiple phone and email messages seeking comment. In a June 17 email to board members, Linfield College board chair David Baca wrote trustees that Jubb had advised him he was resigning “due to health concerns.” “Dave provided valuable service to the board and the College over many decades,” the email said. “He has been a classmate, friend, and associate of many of us for years, and for those so moved, it is appropriate to express gratitude for his positive contributions, but in doing so we should respect Dave’s privacy. Best Regards, David Baca Chair of the Board” On July 9, Linfield College interviewed Motis. The police investigation went to the Yamhill County District Attorney’s Office for review, according to the suit. Yamhill District Attorney Brad Berry said Tuesday that his office is still reviewing the investigative material, which has been assigned to a deputy district attorney. No charges have been filed at this time. The office first received material from McMinnville police in August, then more information from police, as well as other sources, in September and additional material about two weeks ago, Berry said. The college inquiry is still pending, according to the suit. The suit alleges the college was aware of a prior allegation of sexual harassment involving Jubb but failed to investigate. “Ms. Motis was subjected to a hostile educational environment created by Linfield’s failure to properly investigate and/or address Defendant Jubb’s previous allegations of sexual assault or sexually inappropriate behavior,” it says. The college has not yet been officially served with the suit. “But rest assured that protecting students is, and will always be, our highest priority,” Nelson said Tuesday. Motis is on leave from the school. She’s seeking economic damages of $250,000, non-economic damages of $300,000 for emotional distress and psychological damage and unspecified punitive damages. She also wants a judge to order the college to take steps to prevent sex-based discrimination, harassment and assault and fully investigate conduct that may constitute sex-based harassment and/or sexual assault and respond appropriately. -- Maxine Bernstein Email at mbernstein@oregonian.com Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian  Visit subscription.oregonlive.com/newsletters to get Oregonian/OregonLive journalism delivered to your email inbox.

https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2021/10/former-linfield-board-trustee-david-jubb-pleads-no-contest-to-harassment-sentenced-to-probation.html,"David Jubb, a longtime member of Linfield University’s board of trustees who resigned under fire, was sentenced to 18 months of probation Thursday and ordered to undergo an alcohol abuse assessment after he entered no contest pleas to two counts of harassment for groping two students. Jubb, 72, had been set to go to trial Monday, facing an eight-count indictment that accused him of sexually abusing four different students in 2017 and 2019. He had faced one felony count of first degree-sexual abuse and seven misdemeanor counts of third-degree sexual abuse. Instead, all the sexual abuse charges were dismissed and he pleaded no contest to two harassment charges involving two students -- AnnaMarie Motis, an undergraduate student-trustee who said Jubb groped her in February 2019, and another student identified by the initials D.N.D. two years earlier. Motis said Jubb grabbed her and pulled her body to his as they waited in the lobby of the Michelbook Country Club after a faculty-trustee dinner in February 2019 and then continued to touch her inappropriately at a McMinnville bar afterward. Motis has publicly talked about the harassment and read a statement at Jubb’s sentencing. “These past three years, you’ve caused me to live the life of a victim. But that life is no more,” she said. “This is the end of your reign of terror over my life and the lives of all those your hand had silenced.” Motis told police that Jubb “aggressively bumped” her legs under the table at the bar and thrust his hand under her dress and touched her genitalia as he sat across from her at the bar. “I used to hope you would adopt an apologetic heart, or truly any sign of remorse; I thought it would be easier for me to move forward,” Motis said in court. “I do believe the guilt that consumes you is so deeply depressed and denied, it has become penance enough.” Jubb, appearing with his lawyers Stephen A. Houze and his son Jacob Houze, didn’t make a statement. The no contest plea means Jubb didn’t admit guilt but acknowledged the state had sufficient evidence to convict him. Jacob Houze called the negotiated resolution “appropriate.” The plea agreement followed negotiations before Multnomah County Judge Eric J. Bergstrom, who also presided over Jubb’s plea and sentencing in Yamhill County Circuit Court. In the other harassment count, Jubb was accused of over-the-clothes touching of D.N.D.’s buttocks in May 2017. Jubb must complete 40 hours of community service within a year and was ordered not to possess or use any alcoholic beverages or enter any bars, taverns, liquor stores or dispensaries. He also must undergo an alcohol-drug abuse assessment within nine months to determine if there’s a need for treatment or other intervention, according to court records. The court dismissed a single count of first-degree sexual abuse and five counts of third-degree sexual abuse against Jubb under the deal. One of the two harassment charges will be dismissed in 18 months if Jubb adheres to the provisions of his probation, according to court records. Jubb had to take a psycho-sexual evaluation before the plea agreement was accepted, according to attorneys involved. Deputy District Attorney Alisa Ray said the four victims in the case wanted Jubbs to “answer for his conduct,” plead to more than one count, be required to undergo alcohol treatment and face “some sanction as a measure of accountability.” “They have been gracious and patient with this process. But they did not ask for any of this, what happened to them or the circus that followed,” Ray said. Jubb resigned as a board trustee in June 2019 after Motis had complained that he sexually assaulted her after a faculty-trustee dinner. At the time of his resignation, then-board chair David Baca said it was “due to health concerns.” Yet months later, in December 2019, Motis filed a civil suit, and publicly came forward, accusing Jubb of groping her and urged a judge to order Linfield to take steps to prevent and appropriately investigate sexual harassment. One of the students identified only as G.G. who accused Jubb of touching her groin and buttocks on May 5, 2017, wrote in a statement read in court: “Something I would like the judge to take into consideration are the patterns revealed by this case. It’s abuse of power and abuse of people. I believe that it is important that the people who perpetuate these abuses should face consequences for their actions.” Bergstrom mentioned in court that on his drive to the Yamhill County Courthouse Thursday he passed for the first time in his life Linfield University’s campus, where he noted his mom had obtained her teaching degree. “It is a beautiful place and I hate the idea that this case brought any blight on that campus or anyone’s experience on that campus,” the judge said. “My hope is that with this resolution, it brings a closure to Ms. Motis and the complaining witnesses and they can go on to live successful and happy lives as the young, hopeful people that they are,” Bergstrom continued. “And, for Mr. Jubb, that the issues that may have brought him to this moment he can work on, which I know he’s dedicated to doing...and that everybody can put this behind them in an appropriate way while being held accountable.” Jubb is a 1971 Linfield graduate and had served on the board since 1994, chairing its financial affairs committee, according to a college magazine. He was a longtime Portland accountant and lawyer with connections in the corporate and philanthropic world. He’s a former partner of Coopers & Lybrand and also served on the board of The Reser Family Foundation. In September, Baca stepped down as chair of Linfield’s board. He had come under wide campus criticism for the handling of the allegations against Jubb. The accusations and fallout from the administration’s response rocked the 2,000-student liberal arts college in McMinnville. In June 2020, a group of university students circulated a petition calling for Baca to resign after a faculty vote of no-confidence in Baca the month before. The faculty members found Baca failed to protect students after receiving a complaint in 2018 from a graduate who accused Jubb of sexually abusing her and two of her friends in 2017. The Linfield graduate told The Oregonian/OregonLive in May 2020 that the school failed to intervene as promised after she reported in 2018 that Jubb allegedly groped her and two other students after drinking too much at a bar following a senior achievement dinner on campus in 2017. She singled out Baca for criticism, saying the school’s general counsel told her that Baca “gave his word that David Jubb would never have contact with students again or be allowed at events that served alcohol.” Yet on the night of the harassment of Motis in 2019, Baca acknowledged that he was with the group at the bar and said he purposefully sat next to Jubb when he had learned Motis, a student-trustee, also had gone there with Jubb and other trustees, according to university spokesman Scott Nelson. Motis sued the university, reaching a settlement of $500,000 last year. She’s also reached a separate, undisclosed settlement of the civil case with Jubb. -- Maxine Bernstein Email at mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212 Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian  If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2022/03/rock-n-roll-professor-university-of-michigan-finally-served-in-sexual-harassment-lawsuit.html,"ANN ARBOR, MI - It took nearly two months, but a “Rock ‘n’ Roll” professor and the University of Michigan finally have been served with a lawsuit concerning allegations the professor raped and harassed multiple students. Eight female students have named Bruce Conforth, a former teacher and curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, in a Jan. 31 lawsuit accusing him of rape, sexual harassment and other sexual misconduct. The women also allege UM has mishandled complaints made against the 71-year-old professor since 2008. UM was served the complaint on March 15, while Conforth was served on March 21, according to Washtenaw County Circuit Court records. The nearly two-month delay in service was due to the plaintiffs’ attorneys mulling more allegations against Conforth, according to Okemos-based Grewal Law.

Multiple messages for comment left with Conforth’s attorney, Alexander Berry-Santoro of Ypsilanti-based Babut Law Offices, were not returned. MLive/The Ann Arbor News does not typically name victims of sexual assault, but seven of the women name themselves in court records. One of them, Katherine McMahan, said during a Jan. 31 virtual news conference that she first filed a complaint against Conforth in 2008 through UM’s Office of Institutional Equity (now the Equity, Civil Rights and Title IX Office). Since Conforth did not retire until 2017, McMahan accuses UM of allowing him to stay despite knowledge of his misconduct. UM “promptly reviewed all matters brought to its attention” regarding Conforth in 2008, said spokesman Rick Fitzgerald. After Conforth admitted to further accusations made in 2016 and 2017, the university prepared a separation agreement for him to leave, Fitzgerald said. “The 2016-17 review resulted in Mr. Conforth’s immediate departure from the university,” Fitzgerald said. A court date has not yet been set, according to court records. Washtenaw County Circuit Court Judge Timothy Connors will preside over the case. McMahan’s 2008 complaint McMahan, now a 36-year-old program manager at LinkedIn in New York City, took Conforth’s blues history class in 2007, she said. After attending a concert for the class, Conforth invited her and a handful of other students to the downtown Ann Arbor bar Old Town Tavern, 122 W. Liberty St., she said. At one point, Conforth allegedly cornered McMahan in the hallway near the restrooms and embraced her, she said, adding that his long fingernails he uses to play guitar were digging into her lower back. After she expressed discomfort with his advances, he asked her to sleep in his bed, she said. “He said that he was sure his bed was better than mine,” McMahan said. “I was finally able to push him off and say no.” In an email exchange about a potential class trip to the Mississippi Delta, she said she told Conforth she would not be attending. He emailed her requesting she shouldn’t “do anything too rash,” such as report him. McMahan said she saved evidence of the email interactions, and after her spring 2008 graduation, she submitted them in her complaint to UM’s then OIE office. Pam Heatley, the OIE investigator then, told her that Conforth corroborated the events and that UM was “taking all the necessary steps to ensure this wouldn’t happen again,” McMahan said. As Conforth did not resign until 2017, this promise was not kept, McMahan said. “Bruce was allowed to stay to keep teaching,” she said. Isabelle Brourman’s ordeal from 2013 to 2018 Isabelle Brourman, a 28-year-old New York-based artist, also went public in the Jan. 31 news conference with her allegations against Conforth. After meeting in his class in 2013, he obtained her phone number and texted her that he was a member of the Illuminati, she said. This references a secret society founded in Bavaria in 1776, but popularized in fiction in the last two decades. Brourman received emails from someone claiming to lead the Illuminati, ordering her to have sex with Conforth, she said. Conforth raped her in his office and at his home multiple times between 2013-18, she said. He later admitted those emails came from him, Brourman said. “He broke me down through encrypted aliases, increasingly requiring that I report anything I did with outside friends, scorning me for it, and then requiring that I service Bruce sexually as a way to redeem myself,” she said on Jan. 31. “I grew scared, fearful to take missteps. I came to the university to learn and grow and instead one of the most popular professors used his knowledge, authenticated and raved about by the university, to stunt my growth, violate my body and to ruin my life out of jealousy.” Read more from The Ann Arbor News: Mark Schlissel’s firing reveals hypocrisy at University of Michigan, sexual abuse survivors say ‘You can give me a private briefing.’ Emails detail ousted University of Michigan president’s inappropriate relationship University of Michigan students find humor, shame in Mark Schlissel’s firing If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2021/04/ohsu-announces-585000-settlement-of-suit-that-alleged-sexual-harassment-by-tiktok-doc.html,"Oregon Health and Science University has agreed to pay $585,000 to settle a federal lawsuit brought by a social worker who accused a former anesthesiology resident of sexually assaulting her and the school of failing to take action. The university also issued an apology to the woman in a statement released Tuesday and said she will be invited to participate in former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder’s independent investigation of OHSU’s handling of sexual misconduct and discrimination complaints. She alleged that Dr. Jason Campbell harassed her from January through March last year, sending her a pornographic photo of himself and sexually charged text messages and then creeping up behind her in her office and forcibly pressing against her so she could feel his erection. Campbell had gained fame on social media, becoming known as the TikTok Doc for his dance videos in hospital scrubs that went viral during the pandemic. “OHSU offers sincere apologies to the plaintiff and others who have been harmed,” the university’s statement said. “OHSU recognizes the need to address systemic structures that allow inappropriate and damaging behavior to exist, and is committed to creating a safe and inclusive environment that is free of harassment and discrimination.” The woman had complained to OHSU last April and provided a written summary of her allegations with screenshots of text messages exchanged with Campbell. Later that month, the university instructed Campbell to have no contact with her, according to OHSU’s lawyers. By the end of the month, OHSU had removed Campbell from clinical duties and excluded him from campus, a university spokeswoman said. The woman works at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center next to OHSU on the university’s Marquam Hill campus. Campbell was a second-year resident at OHSU and had a pass to access the the VA center. An OHSU investigation concluded last August that Campbell had violated its harassment policy and code of conduct with unwanted touching and inappropriate electronic and text messages, including an unsolicited picture of his erection through his scrub pants. Campbell was referred for dismissal but resigned from his residency in lieu of discharge on Oct. 23, according to the university. The social worker filed suit against Campbell and OHSU this past February in U.S. District Court in Portland, seeking $45 million in damages. She isn’t named in the suit. The settlement, reached through mediation led by retired U.S. District Judge Michael R. Hogan, encompasses the suit’s allegations against both the university and Campbell. John Kaempf, a former lawyer for Campbell, initially wrote to the plaintiff’s lawyers that Campbell denied liability and was deeply in debt, including about $367,000 in school loans, $17,500 in credit card debt with a total about $5,600 in the bank. Since the lawsuit was filed, two more women have submitted sworn statements in court that Campbell also came up from behind them and forced his body against theirs at work in the fall of 2019. A third woman said Campbell followed her around during his rotation in her unit in 2019, asking her for free hugs. The suit led to national fallout for TIME’S UP Healthcare, a group formed to combat sexual harassment in the medical field. More than a dozen of its founding members resigned, criticizing what they said was the group’s inadequate response to allegations in the social worker’s lawsuit that another founding member, OHSU’s Dr. Esther Choo, failed to formally report the harassment accusations to the school’s Title IX coordinator. Instead, the suit says, Choo offered to have a “sit down” with Campbell or have his manager do so. Choo, through a spokeswoman, has said she wasn’t a mandatory reporter because the social worker wasn’t an OHSU student and Campbell wasn’t under her immediate supervision. OHSU also denied that Campbell was acting “in the course and scope of his employment” as an OHSU doctor at the time of any alleged contact with the social worker. Campbell left OHSU and was to start a residency at the University of Florida Health but the school then announced it was placing Campbell on paid leave pending its own investigation. OHSU has hired Holder to examine how the university responded to the complaints against Campbell but also to do a broader review of other cases and his handling of sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. The university’s statement said it “welcomes” the social worker’s “participation in the independent investigation, while acknowledging that doing so may be re-traumatizing.” The investigation by Holder’s Washington, D.C.-based firm Covington & Burling is expected to last six months. Holder’s payment – he agreed to give OHSU a 10% discount on his $2,295 hourly rate -- has drawn outrage from alumni, faculty and lawyers across the state. Michael Fuller and Kim Sordyl, the attorneys who represented plaintiff “A.B.” in her suit, along with Karen O’Kasey, attorney for OHSU, and Courtney Angeli, attorney for Campbell, submitted a stipulated dismissal of the case to the federal court Tuesday morning. The social worker who brought the suit said in a joint statement: “Plaintiff would like to thank those who supported her during this process.” -- Maxine Bernstein Email mbernstein@oregonian.com; 503-221-8212 Follow on Twitter @maxoregonian  If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.

https://www.mlive.com/news/2022/08/abhorrent-actions-lead-to-msu-teachers-resignation-in-lieu-of-termination.html,"EAST LANSING, MI – A former Michigan State University teacher resigned in lieu of termination last year, with the university finding he violated university policy by sexually harassing an individual. Arthur Ward, who had been a teaching specialist at MSU since 2013 in its Lyman Briggs College, resigned on March 5, 2021. Lyman Briggs College Interim Dean Kendra Cheruvelil confirmed his resignation in a message to the college community on March 8, 2021, in the midst of the university’s Office of Institutional Equity investigation into his conduct. In the message, obtained by MLive via a Freedom of Information Act request, Cheruvelil noted that while allegations against Ward were still under review at that time, she “had evidence of conduct that warranted immediate termination.” The OIE’s final investigation report found Ward engaged in conduct that subjected his accuser to sexual harassment in violation of the university’s Relationship Violence and Sexual Misconduct Policy, according to a Nov. 18, 2021, letter from MSU’s Office of the Provost addressed to Ward. The finding was upheld on appeal. Sanctions imposed on Ward include that he is prohibited from future employment at MSU, the Office of the Provost said in the letter, including positions that are both paid and unpaid. Ward also is prohibited from any engagements, speaking or otherwise, involving MSU student organizations. While MSU Deputy Spokesperson Dan Olsen said he could not answer questions specific to the investigation’s findings that ultimately led to Ward leaving the university, he said the university acted quickly when it received allegations. MLive has submitted an additional FOIA request for the final OIE report into Ward’s conduct. Ward declined to comment for this story. “While we may never be able to fully heal the harm Mr. Ward caused, we hope the actions we have taken provide a measure of accountability that assists in the healing process,” Olsen said. Cheruvelil informed the Lyman Briggs College community that Ward had been placed on a leave of absence in a message on Feb. 4, 2021, after receiving “reports of conduct” from Ward that needed to be reviewed. Months after Ward’s resignation in March 2021, Cheruvelil provided an update to the Lyman Briggs community that the investigation had concluded and that Ward had committed “policy violations.” “Dr. Ward’s actions were abhorrent and harm was done to members of our community,” Cheruvelil wrote in the Nov. 16, 2021 message. While informing Lyman Briggs colleagues in the Nov. 16 email that Ward has been restricted from future employment at MSU, Cheruvelil noted Ward does not embody MSU’s ideals, “especially for an award that recognizes contributions to diversity and inclusion.” “I stand by those who came forward, as well as others harmed by Arthur Ward’s actions,” Cheruvelil said.
