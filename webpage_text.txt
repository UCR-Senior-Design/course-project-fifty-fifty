Most recently, he worked as director of Office of Teacher Education and Certification.According to court documents filed in federal court by Alabama A&M, videos of Jones were discovered on a school laptop that recorded the professor in three sex acts, including twice having oral sex with two different male students. All three instances occurred on the Alabama A&M campus, the school said.Jones filed a lawsuit against Alabama A&M in February after the school began termination proceedings after what the lawsuit described as years of harassment when Jones attempted to bring to light administrative issues and concerns.Jones' attorney, Lee Loder, declined to comment on the case beyond the lawsuit.The videos were found on a school laptop recovered at Jones' home after Huntsville police and Alabama A&M police executed a search warrant, according to court documents.Once the videos were discovered, Alabama A&M informed Jones he would be fired."There is convincing evidence that you have engaged in sexual conduct below minimum standards of professional integrity and misused university computing/electronic assets in gross violation of well-established university policy," school Provost Daniel Wims wrote in Jones' March 10, 2016 termination letter, which was included in the court file.According to a memo from Alabama A&M police investigator Brian Ruble, two of the videos were made in 2011 and the third in 2012.Jones previously received a letter outlining the school's intention to terminate him after sexually-graphic photos were discovered on the professor's work computer.In the lawsuit Jones filed, he criticized the Alabama A&M administration for ignoring "red flags" he raised concerning the Office of Teacher Education and Certification. School officials retaliated toward Jones, his lawsuit said, because he wouldn't "play ball and keep his mouth shut about Dr. Jones' previous warnings that AAMU had dropped the ball in several areas of fiscal grant management and implementation."Jones' 30-page lawsuit outlines 11 counts against the school and invokes the Alabama Public Employee Whistleblower Act."Dr. Jones' whistleblower speech and signed statement regarding AAMU's illegal conduct in charging students for services it did not provide and mismanaging federal and state funds designed to implement teacher certification information management system was met with a retaliatory attempt to terminate him, prosecute him and humiliate and ruin Dr. Jones' reputation," the lawsuit stated.In a statement to AL.com, Alabama A&M denied the allegations in the lawsuit. The statement said Jones was guilty of "gross professional misconduct.""As is plainly evident by the university's filings, the university is fully committed to defending its decision to terminate this professor," the school's statement said. "The supporting evidence of the professor's misconduct, which occurred on campus, is clearly identified in the university's response and the recent discovery of this evidence left the university with no alternative."The inappropriate conduct exhibited by this former faculty member will not be tolerated on this campus."If you purchase a product or register for an account through a link on our site, we may receive compensation.
